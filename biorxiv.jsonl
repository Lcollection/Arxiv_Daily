B.; Leigh, A.", "abstract": "The climate variability hypothesis (CVH) predicts that species from environments with more variable temperatures should have wider thermal tolerance breadth. This hypothesis has not yet been tested thoroughly across diverse plants. Here, we asked how local climate predictors (including precipitation, mean and extreme temperatures and thermal variability) are associated with species physiological thermal limits. Measures of lower (Tcrit-cold) and upper (Tcrit-hot) photosystem II thermal tolerance thresholds were used to determine thermal tolerance breadth (TTB), along with ice nucleation temperature (Tnucleation, freezing tolerance) of 69 plant species sampled from the field across three contrasting biomes: alpine, desert and coastal temperate rainforest. All measured thermal tolerance metrics (Tcrit-cold, Tnucleation, Tcrit-hot and TTB) differed among biomes. Notably, desert species had the most cold and heat tolerant leaves, and therefore the widest TTB, whereas species in alpine and temperate biomes had similar TTB. For plants in all biomes, TTB exceeded the thermal range of their local climate. Overall, two Principal Component axes of local climate drivers explained substantial variation in all tolerance metrics. Extreme hot, dry climates improved freezing and heat tolerance. High thermal variability and low minimum temperatures also improved freezing tolerance but were unrelated to heat tolerance or TTB. Species explained a significant amount of variation among all metrics, but this was not due to phylogenetic relatedness. We discuss how the remaining variation could be due to microclimate-driven plasticity, leaf traits or thermoregulatory mechanisms. Synthesis. Our results provide partial support for the climate variability hypothesis in plants: photosystem thermal tolerance breadth was greatest in more thermally variable biomes. This relationship was largely driven by cold tolerance, with variation in heat tolerance explained better by mean and extreme temperatures. Therefore, we conclude that the CVH alone is not sufficient to explain variation in plant thermal tolerance, with many other aspects of climate, environment and biology being potentially important drivers.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Understanding how changes in TF concentration regulate chromatin state and expression across cell state transitions remains a challenge. We investigated this relationship by profiling chromatin accessibility and gene expression at single-cell resolution across a densely sampled time course of reprogramming human fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells via ectopic expression of OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and MYC (OSKM). Using deep learning sequence models of base-resolution chromatin accessibility profiles across cell states, we deciphered predictive transcription factor (TF) motif syntax in regulatory elements, inferred affinity- and concentration-dependent dynamics of TF footprints, linked peaks to putative target genes, and elucidated rewiring of cis-regulatory networks. Our models reveal that early in reprogramming, OSK, at supraphysiological concentrations, rapidly open transient regulatory elements by occupying non-canonical low-affinity binding sites. As OSK concentration falls, the accessibility of these transient elements decays as a function of motif affinity. We find that these OSK-dependent transient elements sequester the somatic TF AP-1. This redistribution is strongly associated with the silencing of fibroblast-specific genes within individual nuclei. Together, our integrated single-cell resource and models reveal insights into the cis-regulatory code of reprogramming at unprecedented resolution. We establish a quantitative, predictive framework that links TF stoichiometry, motif syntax, and somatic silencing to provide new perspectives on the control of cell identity by TFs during fate transitions.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that prior heme-related observations in Caenorhabditis elegans lacking TANGO2 homologs HRG-9 and HRG-10 may be better explained by a previously unreported metabolic phenotype, characterized by reduced feeding, decreased lifespan and brood sizes, and poor motility. We also show that several genes not implicated in heme transport are upregulated in the low heme state and conversely demonstrate that hrg-9 in particular is highly responsive to oxidative stress, independent of heme status. Collectively, these data implicate bioenergetic failure and oxidative stress as potential factors in the pathophysiology of TANGO2 deficiency, in alignment with observations from human patients. Our group performed several experiments in yeast and zebrafish deficient in TANGO2 homologs and was unable to replicate prior findings from these models.

This acquired anoikis resistance is not genetic, persisting for a finite duration without detachment stress, but is sensitive to CDK8/19 Mediator kinase inhibition that can also reverse anoikis resistance. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that CDK8/19 kinase inhibition induces bidirectional transcriptional changes in both sensitive and resistant cells, disrupting the balanced reprogramming required for anoikis adaptation and resistance by reversing some resistance associated pathways and enhancing others. Both anoikis resistance and in vivo metastatic growth of ovarian cancers are sensitive to CDK8/19 inhibition, thereby providing a therapeutic opportunity to both prevent and suppress ovarian cancer metastasis.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

PTCs may become highly aggressive anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATC). While single cell transcriptomics may resolve this heterogeneity, it is potentially confounded by technical effects whose correction may dampen inter-tumor variations. Here we profiled ATCs and BRAFV600E PTCs with single nuclei RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, and an experimental design disentangling biological and technical variations. It reveals that much transcriptional variation in cancer cells and several immune cell types is idiosyncratic, i.e. tumor-specific, a phenomenon obscured by batch integration in a number of single cell studies. Idiosyncrasies are associated in some cases with genomic aberrations and global tissue states like hypoxia. Beyond idiosyncrasies, differentiation markers SLC5A5 (NIS), TPO, TG and TSHR are lost in a sequence mirrored by their gain during human thyroid organoids maturation, suggesting a new classification of cancer cell states. PTC cells retain TSHR expression and show features of partial EMT with a massive expression of FN1, which promotes proliferation via an autocrine loop. In contrast, ATCs undergo full blown EMT, with expression of mesenchymal extracellular components and loss of TSHR. Finally, we show that the microenvironment of cancer cells is driven by inflammation. These findings may help future stratifications of BRAFV600E PTCs.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Methods: A cylindrical phantom was constructed containing vials of agarose gel doped with two paramagnetic materials (ferritin, USPIO) and two diamagnetic materials (CaCl2, CaCO3) at five concentrations each. Single orientation QSM measurements (MEDI+0) were carried out on the phantom at 3T and 7T. We measured molar susceptibility ({chi}mol) from QSM and evaluated the test-retest repeatability of {chi} using the standard error of the measurement (SEM). We evaluated material lifespan by conducting a t-test of ({chi}mol at various timepoints. Results: ({chi}mol (ppm{middle dot}L{middle dot}mmol-1) were measured as 1.67 {+/-} 0.24 and 0.74 {+/-} 0.09 (USPIO: 3T and 7T, respectively), 10-2x(8.13 {+/-} 1.35; 8.13 {+/-} 1.19) (Ferritin: 3T; 7T), 10-4x(-2.68 {+/-} 0.24; -2.71 {+/-} 0.37) (CaCl2: 3T; 7T), and 10-5x(-9.52 {+/-} 1.44; -9.53 {+/-} 1.18) (CaCO3: 3T; 7T).

Unfortunately, accomplishing such a combination is not trivial, as the connectomes are usually derived from different imaging and measuring modalities that are based on different biophysical effects. The functional connectome is typically obtained using fMRI, EEG,or MEG, whereas the structural connectome relies on diffusion-weighted MRI tractography. This work proposes a new way to perform this coupling using an analogy between brain connectomes and an electric circuit. The idea is that functional correlations are treated as potentials and structural connections are treated as resistances of a circuit. In a sense, the proposal is a macro-scale version of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. This work demonstrates how the proposed function-structure coupling can be applied as filtering for tractography by studying the Default Mode Network of a subject from the Human Connectome Project. To provide a ground-truth example, a phantom simulation is used to detail how the method can solve functional connections in direct and indirect structural connection situations. The method is also applied to a cohort of 207 subjects from HCP to combine their functional and structural connectivity matrices to demonstrate how this approach could be used in group-level analyses. Finally, the proposed model is used to predict subject-wise functional connectomes from structural connectivity data. Predictions matched the measured functional connectomes from the same subjects with approximately Pearson's r of 0.73, which is on the level or even surpassing many of the state-of-the-art graph neural network (GNN) approaches.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we used selection linked integration (SLI) to generate parasites all expressing the same PfEMP1 variant and genome edit the expressed locus. Moving this system from the reference strain 3D7 to IT4 resulted in PfEMP1 expressor parasites with effective receptor binding capacities. We also introduce a second version of SLI (SLI2) to introduce additional genome edits. Using these systems, we study PfEMP1 trafficking, generate cell lines binding to the most common endothelial receptors, survey the protein environment from functional PfEMP1 in the host cell and identify new proteins needed for PfEMP1 mediated sequestration.

Increased insulin resistance leads to pancreatic {beta}-islet cell exhaustion and failure, leading to more severe T2DM. As such, targeting {beta}-cell dysfunction is an attractive pathway for T2DM treatment. Single-cell RNA sequencing can help identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may contribute to disease-associated pathophysiology, but cannot capture the full spectrum of disease pathophysiology, as some genes that are not differentially expressed may still play important roles in disease progression or mechanisms. As such, we investigated single-cell gene expression changes in {beta}-cells from healthy (C57BL/6J) and diabetic (NZO/HlLtJ) mice fed with normal or high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFHS) across the spectrum of T2DM development (prediabetic, mild or severely diabetic) using an innovative integration of the causal network perturbation assessment (ssNPA) framework with meta-cell transcriptome analysis to identify driver genes for T2DM. By generating a reference causal network and conducting in silico perturbations, we identified three classes of genes implicated in T2DM pathophysiology: (1) DEGs that were not perturbed (e.g, Igf2bp2 strongly linked to {beta} cell dysfunction and glucose regulation), (2) perturbed non-DEGs (e.g., Glp1r a therapeutic target of modern diabetes drugs) that were perturbed, and (3) DEGs that were perturbed (e.g., Pdx1 a master {beta} cell transcription factor), and validated some of the targets using the KOMP database.

It acts as an oncogene whose expression is correlated with tumor stage and therapy response in melanoma. While metastatic melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer now has two effective treatment options, namely MAPK pathway and immune checkpoint inhibitors, the majority of patients primarily fail to respond or acquire secondary resistance. Hence, innovative approaches to identify disease-relevant, druggable targets to remove the roadblock of therapy resistance are urgently needed. TRIB2 has been implicated in conferring resistance to various anti-cancer therapies suggesting TRIB2 as a therapeutic target for resistant tumors. This study explores the pharmacological targeting of TRIB2, revealing several independent routes of pharmacological manipulations. TRIB2 is a short-lived protein stabilized by inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Conversely, inhibitors of BRAF, MEK and ERK significantly decrease TRIB2 expression by a mechanism that involves transcription. Strikingly, increasing concentrations of the kinase inhibitor PIK75 effectively eliminate TRIB2 in melanoma cells surpassing its PI3K inhibitory activity. Additionally, Polo-Like Kinases (PLKs) inhibitors significantly reduce TRIB2 protein expression and stability. We demonstrate that inhibition or silencing of PLK2 leads to a decrease in TRIB2 levels. Overall, we identify three distinct classes of compounds that efficiently eliminate the oncogenic TRIB2 protein from melanoma cells based on different molecular mechanisms and exhibiting 40 to 200 times greater potency than the previously reported afatinib.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Although most studies recruit a large number of participants in order to uncover population-level effects, growing evidence suggests that tDCS may be expected to induce different effects in different individuals, leading to large inter-individual variability and confounds in population-level testing. Additionally, variability may arise from intra-individual differences and confounds that are difficult to assess in studies with limited to no re-testing. Here, we performed 10 sessions of tDCS each on 5 human participants performing a free choice saccade task while neural activity was measured via EEG. Participants first underwent functional MRI to localize the human right frontal eye field (rFEF) homologue. An HD-tDCS montage was then used to focally target rFEF based on individual MRI localizations, alternating the polarity between anodal or cathodal current over repeated sessions during a 5 week period (twice weekly). On stimulation days, participants performed a free choice task prior to and after administration of tDCS while EEG activity was recorded. To quantify the likelihood that tDCS induced a causal effect on behaviour and neural activity across different levels of analysis, we developed a multilevel causal inference method based on permutation testing of a quasi-experiment (difference-in-differences). We then used this method to assess the likelihood of a causal effect at different levels of abstraction: group-level, participant-level, and paired-session level. At the group-level, we found evidence for an influence of tDCS on choice reaction times, which followed a reaction-time dependent change in EEG activity, and on how choices depended on previous trials. However, individuals showed heterogeneous effects. Further, analysis of paired-session variability often belied the pooled individual effect, suggesting that different sessions of tDCS may have produced markedly different effects in the same participants. In light of this, we discuss potential causes of this variability, and the counterfactuals that should be considered when making data-driven inferences about the effects of tDCS.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

While reactive oxygen species (ROS) alone were insufficient for bacterial killing, reactive nitrogen species (RNS), particularly peroxynitrite, mediated strong microbicidal effects via nitrotyrosine formation. These effects occurred independently of acidic conditions, demonstrating that antimicrobial activity is retained at neutral pH. Alongside, hsPAbW effectively reduced bacterial burden on metal surfaces and exhibited superior killing compared to high doses of standard antibiotics, including ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem in vitro.

CRAC channels enable store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) from the extracellular space and are crucial for granule exocytosis and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) dependent gene expression in activated lymphocytes. Syntaxin11 depletion strongly inhibited SOCE, CRAC currents, NFAT activation, interleukin-2 gene expression and degranulation in FHLH4 patient T lymphocytes and cell lines. Remarkably, defects of granule exocytosis as well as interleukin-2 expression could be reversed by ionomycin induced calcium influx in patient T lymphocytes and a constitutively active, H134S, mutant of Orai1 rescued calcium entry in Syntaxin11 depleted cells. Further mechanistic analyses showed that Syntaxin11 primes Orai1 subunits for correct on-site assembly which is a prerequisite for functional entrapment and gating of CRAC channels by the endoplasmic reticulum resident Stim1.

O.; Parker, S. C. J.; Tovar, A.", "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a common metabolic disorder characterized by dysregulation of glucose metabolism. Genome-wide association studies have defined hundreds of signals associated with T2D and related metabolic traits, predominantly in noncoding regions. While pancreatic islets have been a focal point given their central role in insulin production and glucose homeostasis, other metabolic tissues, including liver, adipose, and skeletal muscle, also contribute to T2D pathogenesis and risk. Here, we examined context-specific genetic regulation under basal and stimulated states. Using LHCN-M2 human skeletal muscle cells, we generated transcriptomic profiles and characterized regulatory activity of 327 metabolic trait-associated variants via a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA). To identify condition-specific effects, we compared four different conditions: (1) undifferentiated, or (2) differentiated with basal media, (3) media supplemented with the AMP analog AICAR (to simulate exercise) or (4) media containing sodium palmitate (to induce insulin resistance). RNA-seq revealed these treatments extensively perturbed transcriptional regulation, with 498-3,686 genes showing significant differential expression between pairs of conditions. Among differentially expressed genes, we observed enrichment of relevant biological pathways including muscle differentiation (undifferentiated vs. differentiated), oxidoreductase activity (differentiated vs. AICAR), and glycogen binding (differentiated vs. palmitate). The results of our MPRA found broadly different levels of activity between all conditions. Our MPRA screen revealed a shared set of 7 variants with significant allelic activity across all conditions, along with a proportional number of variants showing condition-specific allelic bias and the total number of active oligos per condition. We found that a lead variant for serum triglyceride levels, rs490972, overlaps SP transcription factor motifs and has differential regulatory activity between conditions. Comparison of MPRA activity with paired gene expression data allowed us to predict that regulatory activity at this locus is mediated by SP1 transcription factor binding. While several of the MPRA variants have been previously characterized in other metabolic tissues, none have been studied in these stimulated states. Together, this work uncovers context-dependent transcriptomic and regulatory dynamics of T2D- and metabolic trait-associated variants in skeletal muscle cells, offering new insights into their functional roles in metabolic processes.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here we show that, in families of functionally conserved homologous enzymes, structural divergence increases with both residue flexibility and distance from the active site. Although these properties are correlated, modelling reveals that the pattern arises from two independent types of evolutionary constraints: non-functional and functional. The balance between these constraints varies widely across enzyme families, from non-functional to functional dominance. As functional constraints strengthen, structural divergence patterns are reshaped, becoming increasingly distinct from flexibility patterns and breaking the commonly assumed correspondence between evolutionary and dynamical structural ensembles. Active sites are more structurally conserved than average, but this conservation stems not only from functional constraints. Because active sites typically lie in rigid regions where non-functional constraints are high, both constraint types contribute comparably on average, with dominance shifting from one to the other depending on active-site rigidity. Together, these findings revise two long-standing assumptions: that evolutionary structural variation universally mirrors protein dynamics, and that active-site conservation reflects functional requirements alone. Both depend on the balance between non-functional and functional constraints that shape enzyme structural evolution.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

To generate general insights into such responses, a framework integrating traits on life history, dispersal and thermal niche is currently lacking. In light of this, understanding to which degree these traits covary and are organised into syndromes are key to improve distribution forecasting under climate change. We quantified life history, dispersal and thermal range covariation among 4000 Western European arthropod species spanning eight orders, considering phylogenetic relationships to account for shared ancestry. We demonstrate the existence of two independent axes of life history variation: the fast-slow continuum and the reproductive strategy axis. Notably, species at the fast end of the continuum tend to have higher dispersal capacities and broader thermal niches than slower species. The resulting syndromes were surprisingly consistent across orders, indicating a relatively uniform pattern of trait covariations across arthropod groups. These trait combinations, which generally enhance range-shifting potential, point to the emergence of two distinct groups of arthropods: those well-suited and those less equipped to mitigate the effects of future climate change.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

However, the precise algorithm cells use for source seeking is unknown. We show that cells can perform source seeking using a biophysical implementation of a computational algorithm called Bayes filtering. Specifically, the spatial distribution of molecules within the cell encodes a probability distribution over source location, and intracellular transport processes update this distribution. Live-cell imaging and spatial proteomics reveal that receptor dynamics in vivo matches the evolution of belief distributions under Bayes filtering. Unlike standard Bayes filtering, the cellular implementation adapts to fluctuating measurement noise without explicitly estimating noise statistics. When translated to traditional robotics algorithms, this cell-inspired adaptation enables robust navigation without continuously estimating signal statistics.

A.", "abstract": "The MGM complex, comprising the MKI67 (Ki-67), GNL2, and MDN1 proteins, plays a crucial role in RNA metabolism. However, the functions of these proteins are largely unknown. Here, we describe their functions. MKI67 binds to proliferating-cell chromosomes through consensus sequences and primarily localizes at the nucleolar periphery. Peripheral MKI67 maintains pre-60S particles in the nucleolus and then releases them into the nucleus by recruiting MDN1 via GNL2. This MKI67 also appears to be essential for importing nucleolar proteins and protein complexes. Furthermore, it is associated with organizing acrocentric and non-acrocentric chromosomes. Additionally, MKI67 regulates the levels of numerous genomic transcripts, including UNC13A and NEK7. MKI67 downregulates UNC13A during transcription and downregulates NEK7 by involving mRNA degradation systems. MKI67 knockdown upregulates SLC7A2 transcripts and its paralogs. These transcripts are known to activate mTORC1 and increase protein synthesis and proliferation. This finding implies that the absence of MKI67 enables differentiated tissue cells to live longer and perform their cell-type-specific activities. MDN1 knockdown downregulates the pre-60S particle-related RNAs and respiratory complex transcripts. This indicates the existence of a mechanism that prevents wasteful energy production when ribosome biosynthesis decreases.

We found this suppression deployed in several critical functions. In appetitive evaluation, it controls food value perception by suppressing AGRP based on a food's predicted caloric worth. In adaptive vigilance, it creates an opportunity to prioritize other needs, such as responding to novel, arousing stimuli. During spontaneous pupil dilations, it creates hunger-free windows for optimal assessment of the environment.

Facial movements are controlled, according to the dominant neuropsychological schema, by two separate circuits, one originating in medial frontal cortex controlling emotional expressions, and a second one originating in lateral motor and premotor areas controlling voluntary facial movements. Despite this functional dichotomy, cortical anatomy suggests that medial and lateral areas are directly connected and may thus operate as a single network. Here we test these contrasting hypotheses through structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) guided electrical stimulation and simultaneous multi-channel recordings from key facial motor areas in the macaque monkey brain. These areas include medial facial motor area M3 (located in the anterior cingulate cortex); two lateral face-related motor areas: M1 (primary motor) and PMv (ventrolateral premotor); and S1 (primary somatosensory cortex). Cortical responses evoked by intracortical stimulation revealed that medial and lateral areas can exert significant functional impact on each other. Simultaneous recordings of local field potentials in all facial motor areas further confirm that during facial expressions, medial and lateral facial motor areas significantly interact, primarily in the alpha and beta frequency ranges, whereas during voluntary chewing, coupling occurs at lower frequencies. These functional interactions varied across facial movement types. Thus, at the cortical level, the control of facial movements is not mediated through independent (medial/lateral) functional streams, but results from an interacting sensorimotor network.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we have identified and characterised the first iron and zinc importer in T. gondii.

To confirm transport activity, we find that knockdown of ZFT leads to a reduction is parasite-associated zinc and iron, and ZFT expression complements loss of zinc transporter activity in a yeast model. Further, expression of ZFT in Xenopus oocytes demonstrates direct uptake of iron, which outcompeted in the presence of zinc.

One region--spanning Crus I/II/lobule VIIb--is selective for language relative to diverse non-linguistic perceptual, cognitive, and motor tasks (Experiments 2a-f, n=732), and the rest exhibit mixed-selective profiles, responding strongly to language but also to one or more of the non-linguistic conditions. Similar to the neocortical language system, the language-selective region is engaged by sentence-level meanings during comprehension and production (Experiments 3a-b, n=100) and shows fine-grained sensitivity to linguistic processing difficulty (Experiment 3c, n=5).

Finally, all four regions, but especially Crus I/II/VIIb, are functionally connected to the neocortical language system (Experiment 4, n=85).

RNA-sequencing analysis revealed lateralized differences in the number and identity of differentially expressed genes, accompanied by distinct biological themes, as indicated by overrepresentation and gene set enrichment analysis.

Parts of the foreign DNA, called spacers, are incorporated into the CRISPR array which constitutes the immune memory. The orientation of CRISPR arrays is crucial for analyzing and understanding the functionality of CRISPR systems and their targets. Several methods have been developed to identify the orientation of a CRISPR array. To predict the orientation, different methods use different features such as the repeat sequences between the spacers, the location of the leader sequence, the Cas genes, or PAMs. However, those features are often not sufficient to predict the orientation with certainty, or different methods disagree. Remarkably, almost all CRISPR systems have been found to insert spacers in a polarized manner at the leader end of the array. We introduce CRISPR-evOr, a method that leverages the resulting patterns to predict the acquisition orientation for (a group of) CRISPR arrays by reconstructing and comparing the likelihood of their evolutionary history with respect to both possible acquisition orientations. The new method is independent of Cas type, leader existence and location, and transcription orientation. CRISPR-evOr is thus particularly useful for arrays that other CRISPR orientation tools cannot predict confidently and to verify or resolve conflicting predictions from existing tools. CRISPR-evOr currently confidently predicts the orientation of 28.3% of the arrays in the considered subset of CRISPRCasdb, which other tools like CRISPRDirection and CRISPRstrand cannot reliably orient. As our tool leverages evolutionary information we expect this percentage to grow in the future when more closely related arrays will be available.

Interestingly, our model accurately describes mature mRNA counts but not nascent mRNA counts, suggesting the need for an alternative technical model for data derived from nascent transcripts. Using single-cell RNA-seq data, we characterize both biological and technical extrinsic noise and cell size factors estimated using Poisson-like genes. Overall, our model helps clarify common misconceptions and provides insight into the role of extrinsic noise and size factor normalization in scRNA-seq data.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

G.; Lyon, C. M.; Naglik, J. R.; Hube, B.; Keyel, P. A.", "abstract": "The common fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, relies on the pore-forming toxin candidalysin to damage host cells. Cells counteract pore-forming toxins by Ca2+-dependent mechanisms, such as microvesicle shedding and annexin recruitment to resist cholesterol-dependent cytolysins like streptolysin O (SLO), or annexin involvement and patch repair in the case of aerolysin. However, the specific Ca2+-dependent repair pathways engaged in response to candidalysin remain poorly understood. Here, we determined the involvement of different Ca2+-dependent repair mechanisms to candidalysin and compared responses to SLO and aerolysin using flow cytometry and high-resolution microscopy. We report that candidalysin triggered Ca2+-dependent repair, but patch repair and ceramide failed to provide significant protection. MEK-dependent repair and annexins A1, A2 and A6 contributed partially to repairing damage caused by candidalysin. However, annexin translocation after candidalysin challenge was delayed compared to SLO or aerolysin challenge. Surprisingly, extracellular Cl- improved cell survival after candidalysin challenge, but not after challenge with SLO or aerolysin. Finally, we found that candidalysin is removed via extracellular vesicle shedding. These findings reveal that Ca2+-dependent microvesicle shedding protects cells from candidalysin and can be engaged by multiple molecular mechanisms during membrane repair.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Loss of function mutation of MeCP2, which impairs DNA binding, causes Rett syndrome, while gain of MeCP2 function causes MeCP2 duplication syndrome. MeCP2 functions as both transcription activator and repressor but its full range of activity remains largely unknown. Recent study suggests that beyond DNA binding, MBD domain of MeCP2 also interacts with methylated lysine residues on histone H3 tail. In this study we aimed to characterize the methyllysine binding pocket of MeCP2-MBD. Structural analysis reveals the presence of an aromatic cage formed by five residues, namely, W104, F132, Y141, F142, and F155, where the trimethyllysine of H3K27me3 binds, as confirmed in docking studies. Alanine substitution of these residues abolished binding of MeCP2-MBD with its reported ligand H3K27me3 in ITC and pull-down experiments. Genomic analysis of publicly available ChIP-seq data reveals that MeCP2 localizes with canonical histone methylation marks like H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 and regulate critical biological and cancer related pathways. Promoters of MeCP2 regulated genes, show signature of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. In the genomic level, mutation of aromatic cage residue W104A, significantly reduced chromatin occupancy of MeCP2 as demonstrated by ChIP-qPCR experiments. Furthermore, our qRT-PCR experiment, shows that this aromatic cage dependent binding is necessary for regulating expression of MeCP2 target genes. Overall, our study establishes MeCP2 as a histone methylation reader and highlights the functional significance of its histone binding capacity in chromatin association and gene regulation.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here we present a high-temporal resolution amplicon sequence data set collected during the spring ice-algal bloom near Utqia[g]vik, Alaska in 2021 to study sea-ice microbial dynamics. The ice-algal bloom peaked on May 8th, reaching 46.6 mg chlorophyll a m-2, and thereafter became limited by nitrate availability. A massive bloom of the oil-degrading bacterium, Oleispira (>80% relative abundance), coincided with the algal bloom raising questions about hydrocarbon exposure. The sea-ice algal bloom was dominated by diatoms, particularly Nitzschia spp., and transitioned into a flagellate dominated post-bloom community which aligned with melt-associated changes to the physicochemical environment. We explored the relationship between putative parasitoids, Chytridiomycetes, Thecofilosea (Cercozoa), Oomycetes, Syndiniales (Dinoflagellata), and Labyrinthulomycetes (Bigyra), and potential microalgal hosts. Chytrids peaked periodically suggesting synchronized infections and Cryothecomonas (Thecofilosea) was observed parasitizing Nitzschia spp. for the first time in Arctic sea ice. Co-occurrence analysis suggested that diatoms, especially Nitzschia, were the primary hosts of Pacific-Arctic parasitoids, and that top-down parasitoid control may dramatically alter community composition over short timescales, such as days. These results provide important insights into the drivers of spring bloom timing and maintenance of microalgal diversity in sea ice.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

The diversity of effects that locomotion exerts on sensory neurons, as well as disparities between species, raises questions about the existence of universal principles that may underlie sensation during behavior. We propose that sensory systems are modulated in anticipation of systematic changes in stimulus statistics caused by locomotion to maintain an accurate and efficient sensory code across behavioral states. Model neurons optimized to encode stimuli recorded during movement in natural environments predict and reproduce a broad spectrum of experimental observations. The proposed, simple principle of anticipatory modulation reconciles the diversity of ways in which locomotion modulates visual coding in different animal species.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here we report that, prior to disassembling AJs and acquiring malignant traits, premalignant mammary epithelial cells overactivating the Src proto-oncogene transiently enhance tensile forces at both AJs and FAs, thereby gaining a proliferative advantage. We show that AJs and FAs are transiently under higher tensile forces in premalignant Src-activated cells. Cells unable to increase tensile forces at FAs by knocking down PXN or inhibiting FAK activity fail to transiently build up tensile force at AJs and to grow. Conversely, preventing AJ strengthening using EGTA or small interference RNA against P-cadherin suppresses the transient increase in tensile forces at FAs, EGFR-ERK and MRTF-A-SRF activation and cell proliferation. Moreover, knocking down E-cadherin, the sole classical cadherin in Drosophila, inhibits Src-induce tissue overgrowth in vivo. Thus, prior to the loss of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesiveness, strengthening of AJs and FAs may be an essential early step for mammary cells to gain a proliferative advantage and establish the mechanical and signaling conditions necessary for subsequent malignant transformation.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Methods To investigate the transcriptional and cellular consequences of -syn oligomer spreading, we employed spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) in a transgenic PD mouse model expressing human -syn in neurons. We further compared our findings to published public snRNA-seq datasets from human PD patients Results Our analysis identified -syn spreading mostly to the substantia nigra and defined a transcriptional Spreading Signature associated with -syn pathology. We found an age correlated increase in astrocytes, close interactions between astrocytes and -syn, and transcriptional dysregulation of the astrocyte-glutamatergic neuron axis. We further identified two subtypes of glutamatergic neurons that are vulnerable to astrocytic changes. Comparative analysis with human PD snRNA-seq data showed concordant transcriptional changes related to astrocytic dysfunctions and diminished neuronal signaling.

Unlike the stereotypical pruning-then-regrowth paradigm, these DANs undergo a transient axon overgrowth followed by selective pruning during metamorphosis. Remarkably, DAN axon pruning proceeds independently of canonical ecdysone signaling and instead involves neuron-intrinsic AKT-GSK3{beta} signaling and extrinsic glial activity. Disruption of AKT-GSK3{beta} signaling alters microtubule stability and impairs glial recruitment and clearance of axonal debris.

However, analyses of early colorectal cancer lesions suggest that tumors may instead originate from multiple, genetically distinct cell populations2,3. Detecting polyclonal tumor initiation is challenging in patients, as it requires profiling early-stage lesions before clonal sweeps obscure diversity. To investigate this, we analyzed normal colorectal mucosa, benign and dysplastic premalignant polyps, and malignant adenocarcinomas (123 samples) from six individuals with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Individuals with FAP have a germline heterozygous APC mutation, predisposing them to colorectal cancer and numerous premalignant polyps by early adulthood4. Whole-genome and/or whole-exome sequencing revealed that many premalignant polyps- 40% with benign histology and 28% with dysplasia- were composed of multiple genetic lineages that diverged early, consistent with polyclonal origins. This conclusion was reinforced by whole-genome sequencing of single crypts from multiple polyps in additional patients which showed limited sharing of mutations among crypts within the same lesion. In some cases, multiple distinct APC mutations co-existed in different lineages of a single polyp, consistent with polyclonality. These findings reshape our understanding of early neoplastic events, demonstrating that tumor initiation can arise from the convergence of diverse mutant clones. They also suggest that cell-intrinsic growth advantages alone may not fully explain tumor initiation, highlighting the importance of microenvironmental and tissue-level factors in early cancer evolution.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

M.; Dechow, S. J.; Abdalla, B. J.; Abramovitch, R.

To understand the basis of the propionate-driven growth arrest at acidic pH, we conducted a genetic selection for mutants enabling growth on propionate at pH 5.7. All the selected mutants had insertions in the two-component regulatory genes phoR or phoP. We hypothesized that growth arrest at acidic pH is caused by PhoPR diverting carbon from central carbon metabolism towards lipid anabolism and that when PhoPR is inactivated, growth is promoted through metabolizing propionate by the methyl citrate cycle (MCC) into pyruvate, a permissive carbon source for growth at acidic pH. Using chemical inhibition and mutants of the MCC pathway, we demonstrate that the enhanced growth is dependent on the MCC. Furthermore, stimulating lipid synthesis via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway by adding vitamin B12 restricts growth in the phoPR mutant and, conversely, restricting lipid anabolism by inhibiting the triacylglycerol (TAG) synthase Tgs1 enhances growth of the phoPR mutant. Notably, CoA pools increased in the phoPR mutant grown on propionate, directly supporting our model. Given the role of CoA metabolism in pyrazinamide sensitivity, Mtb sensitivity to pyrazinamide was examined on propionate at acidic pH. Surprisingly, pyrazinamide treatment of WT Mtb suppresses growth arrest on propionate at acidic pH. In contrast, the phoPR mutant has enhanced sensitivity to pyrazinamide. Together, these findings support that propionate-driven growth arrest at acidic pH is caused by metabolic remodeling that is regulated by PhoPR and is associated with pyrazinamide sensitivity.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have typically estimated joint torques from joint pose images, marker coordinates, or EMG signals, which severely limit their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we aim to directly predict joint torques during human movements from real human images. To address this gap, we present the vision-based inverse dynamics dataset (VID), the first dataset tailored for the joint torque prediction from real human images. VID comprises 63,369 frames of synchronized monocular images, kinematic data, and dynamic data of real human subjects. All data are carefully synchronized, refined, and manually validated to ensure high quality. In addition, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for the vision-based inverse dynamics of real human images, consisting of a new baseline method and a new evaluation criteria with three levels of difficulty: (i) overall joint torque estimation, (ii) joint-specific analysis, and (iii) action-specific prediction. We further compare the baseline result of our VID-Network with other representative approaches, our baseline method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on almost all the evaluation criteria. By releasing VID and the accompanying evaluation protocol, we aim to establish a foundation for advancing biomechanics from real human images and to facilitate the exploration of new approaches for human inverse dynamics in unconstrained environments.

A potential cancer biomarker, ORF1p expression is a hallmark of multiple cancers and an early event in precursor lesions. Our study provides a comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of ORF1p using CPTAC proteogenomic data, revealing a dichotomous role in modulating immune responses. Integrated analyses and supervised learning models divide ORF1p-high tumors into two groups: (1) high ORF1p associates with immunosuppression, reduced interferon signaling and diminished immune cell infiltration (HNSCC and LSCC), and (2) ORF1p-high tumors associate with immune activation (UCEC). Linear regression models reveal that cancer-specific aneuploidies may underlie this immune dichotomy, highlighting the prognostic significance of ORF1p and informing new strategies to leverage detection of plasma-circulating ORF1p to enhance immunotherapeutic efficacy in different tumor contexts.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

A.; Reinsch, N.", "abstract": "Background: While genomic selection (GS) boosts rapid genetic gains by leveraging dense marker data for genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs), prolonged application can reduce haplotype diversity and increase inbreeding. To address these risks, recent research has emphasized Mendelian sampling variance (MSV) and covariance (MSC), which capture within-family (co)variation not fully reflected in GEBVs. In parallel, theoretical advances have introduced a haplotype-based similarity measure that targets shared heterozygous segments, enabling more direct control over haplotype diversity, either standalone or in combination with conventional coancestry-based and genomic relationship matrices. Results: We present PyMSQ, an open-source Python package that implements two key developments: (1) a matrix-based approach for computing MSV and MSC in single-trait, multi-trait, and zygotic contexts, and (2) a haplotype-based similarity metric. By combining this matrix-based framework with optimized scientific libraries, PyMSQ achieves up to 332-fold faster computations than gamevar, a publicly available alternative, while preserving numerical accuracy. Using a Holstein-Friesian dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PyMSQ in deriving MSV and MSC, as well as its novel similarity measure, which complements standard genomic relationship matrices by explicitly quantifying shared heterozygous segments rather than overall allele sharing, thereby providing additional insights for balancing immediate gains with long-term diversity. Conclusion: By facilitating the practical use of MSV, MSC, and a haplotype-based similarity metric, PyMSQ enables breeders and quantitative geneticists to adopt haplotype diversity constraint, whether as a standalone criterion or in synergy with optimal contribution selection. This framework opens new possibilities for preserving key haplotypic segments, ultimately supporting more sustainable genomic selection strategies.

While early work assumed these processes combined additively, recent studies have challenged this view. However, these studies may have overlooked subtle spatial and temporal dynamics, which could influence how explicit aiming and implicit recalibration interact. Recent research shows that implicit recalibration anchors to where a person aims their movements, with aiming strategies directly shaping their spatial development. Moreover, implicit recalibration operates across multiple timescales, with both temporally volatile and persistent components. To examine whether these factors mask the true relationship between explicit strategies and implicit recalibration, we conducted a visuomotor rotation task while carefully accounting for the interplay of spatial and temporal dynamics. After controlling for spatial dynamics (plan-based generalization) and temporal dynamics (forgetting), we found a strong relationship between explicit strategies and implicit recalibration. Despite finding this strong relationship, it appears to be sub-additive, which may result from simple methodological imprecision, the operation of additional but unobserved processes, or more complex nonlinear interactions between processes.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Remarkably, neuropeptide content in sLNv terminals is rhythmic with late-night accumulation occurring while the axon arbor is expanding in preparation for midmorning synaptic exocytosis of neuropeptide-containing dense-core vesicles (DCVs). Past studies showed increased synaptic neuropeptide content can be produced by delivery of more neuropeptide to terminals or activity-dependent capture of circulating DCVs. To distinguish between these mechanisms, neuropeptide-containing DCVs were imaged in the living brain explant. First, post-exocytosis DCV axonal transport and synaptic neuropeptide accumulation following retrograde transport inhibition show that sLNv DCVs circulate. Furthermore, anterograde transport to terminals is constant throughout the day demonstrating there is no increase in DCV delivery. Rather, capture of circulating DCVs produces the daily boost in terminal neuropeptide content. Remarkably, this capture occurs before the daily increase in Ca2+ spike activity and is also independent of concurrent IP3 signaling and daily axon arbor expansion. Finally, a per clock gene mutation inhibits rhythmic DCV capture. Thus, rather than participating in axonal plasticity or responding to Ca2+ signaling, capture of circulating DCVs in sLNv presynapses is increased by the molecular clock in anticipation of activity-induced release hours later.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that RBFOX2 is essential for progressing cardiomyocyte (CM) differentiation by shifting exon usage profiles to more mature states in sarcomere, cytoskeletal, and focal adhesion genes, including ALPHA-ACTININ-2 (ACTN2). This maturation program is initiated by critical levels of RBFOX2 that facilitate self-splicing at mutually exclusive exons encoding early and late isoforms with distinct functional roles. In heterozygous CMs, self-splicing is disrupted, which skews isoform ratios and generates a dominant-negative caused by exon co-inclusion. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of correctly spliced ACTN2 rescues heterozygous, but not null, phenotypes by restoring contractility, which triggers a mechanosensing feedback loop involving upregulation of RBFOX2 from the wildtype allele and transcriptome maturation. Our data suggest that decreased RBFOX2 dosage and self-splicing impairs CM differentiation, contributing to CHD pathogenesis and heart failure susceptibility.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Their functions rely on their innate ability to interact with membranes dynamically in response to rapidly changing cellular conditions. This membrane recruitment may occur via high-affinity interactions with specific lipids or transient, low-affinity membrane interactions. These weak and dynamic interactions, which are critical regulators of protein function, are challenging to capture. Taking Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase essential for B cell activation, as an example, we demonstrate a native mass spectrometry (nMS) platform to understand the recruitment of PMPs by directly studying them from lipid bilayers customized to target membranes. Our data demonstrate that BTK recognizes phosphatidylserine (PS) through sites distinct from phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-phosphate (PIP3) binding. We show that PS-bound BTK retains PIP3 binding simultaneously via high-affinity sites, exhibiting PIP3-independent basal membrane recruitment of BTK. Biochemical assays show that this PS-mediated recruitment sensitizes BTK to PIP3-mediated activation under near-physiological concentrations of PIP3. Thus, we propose a two-step model for BTK membrane recruitment and activation. A low-affinity interaction with high-copy-number PS enables plasma membrane recruitment of BTK and increases its membrane-bound concentration. Upon B-cell activation, this pre-recruited, membrane-bound BTK population localizes to PIP3-rich domains through electrostatic gliding along the membrane driven by low-affinity PS and high-affinity PIP3 binding. This indicates a cooperative mechanism in which PS can amplify B-cell signaling through increased membrane-bound BTK concentration. Our work demonstrates a general model of PH-domain-containing protein regulation by weak protein-lipid interactions, which can be extended to many other PMPs.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Recent observations have revealed LAT assembly occurs in discretized condensates traceable to single molecular TCR activation events. Moreover, the condensation process occurs abruptly, but after a distinct delay, indicative of a type of phase transition. Here we examine the effects of costimulatory (CD80, CD86) and inhibitory (PD-L1) ligands on the nucleation propensity of LAT condensation. We utilize single molecule mobility tracking to resolve the moment a pMHC molecule binds to TCR combined with intracellular imaging to measure the time delay between pMHC:TCR binding and nucleation of the corresponding LAT condensate. These delay time distributions reflect the propensity function for stochastic nucleation of the LAT condensate and provide a measure of the effective signal strength from a single, activated TCR. The results reveal that CD28 stimulation by CD80 or CD86 causes a distinct reduction in the mean delay time to LAT condensation while PD-L1 is mildly antagonistic to the process. Collectively, these observations strengthen evidence that probability and timing of the LAT nucleation process itself is tightly associated with signal propagation downstream from individual TCR activation events.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Such preparatory activity has been traditionally thought to lead to shorter reaction times by allowing the motor network to settle into states favourable to motor execution without directly engaging the peripheral musculature, limiting such preparatory states to central neural processes only. We revisited this question by recording motor unit related activity using high-density surface EMG grid electrodes, from the Anterior Deltoid muscle, a proximal muscle, during a delayed reach task. We observed that anodal stimulation of the supplementary motor area (SMA) enhances motor preparation by shortening reaction times, while simultaneously and preferentially recruiting smaller amplitude motor units. Additionally, we found that the SMA stimulation also produced a subsequent increase in movement velocities due to the increase activation of larger amplitude motor units. Taken together, we suggest that motor preparatory states involve an active interaction between central and peripheral processes with direct descending SMA outputs to the spinal cord providing a link between cortical preparation and muscle readiness, resulting in decreased reaction times. In addition, the increased gain of such central to peripheral interactions also increases the subsequent gain of during the execution phase via modulating larger amplitude motor unit activation, resulting in increased response vigour.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Recoverers exhibit a variable yet finite lag before resuming growth in the new environment, whereas arresters remain in a non-growing, arrested state until more favorable conditions return. Although the diversification of individual cells into arresters and recoverers is a robust phenomenon, it remains unclear whether this coexistence constitutes an evolutionarily stable strategy. Here, we demonstrate that a heterogeneous strategy composed of both arrester and recoverer phenotypes maximizes long-term population fitness across a broad spectrum of growth-lag trade-offs. Our analysis employs a dynamic programming framework to identify the fitness-maximizing distribution of phenotypes for populations that stochastically switch between preferred and non-preferred environments. We propose a minimal model incorporating metabolism, growth, and enzyme allocation to explain the physiological origin of a power-law growth-lag trade-off that favors phenotypic heterogeneity. The theory predicts a nontrivial relationship between the fraction of recoverers and their lag time, which aligns with existing data from wild yeast strains, evolved isolates, and variations in pre-shift growth conditions. This relationship suggests an evolutionary  rheostat-like mechanism that enables populations to rapidly adapt to changing environmental conditions.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

However, the extent to which these behaviors rely on social transmission versus the activation of pre-existing, latent behaviors remains unclear. Here, we systematically investigated the necessity of social observation for maternal behavior acquisition, using a social transmission pup retrieval paradigm in pup-naive virgin female mice. Following the same protocol as previous studies, we compared retrieval performance on conditions that either allowed or prevented the visual observation of maternal demonstrations. Contrary to previous findings reporting substantial differences between these conditions, we found that virgin females readily acquired pup retrieval behavior regardless of their visual access to experienced mothers. We observed no significant correlation between maternal and virgin performance after task exposure. Detailed behavioral analysis revealed that the primary difference between mothers and virgins lay on the latency to initiate the behavior, but once started, virgins complete the retrieval as fast as mothers. Together, our findings show that pup exposure is enough to activate latent behaviors, and suggest that pup retrieval might not be transmitted by visual observation.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

How substrates avoid being trapped on the Cdc48 ATPase complex is incompletely understood, as they can undergo repeated cycles of translocation through the ATPase pore. Here, we show that the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) Otu1 (Yod1 in mammals) can break this futile cycle. Otu1 trims the ubiquitin chain of the substrate before its translocation through the Cdc48 pore is initiated, allowing transfer to the proteasome and subsequent degradation. Thus, Otu1 differs from other DUBs in that it stimulates, rather than retards, protein degradation. A cryo-EM structure shows that the mammalian homolog Yod1 binds to p97 simultaneously with other Cdc48 cofactors.

In this study, we address this paradox of glassy dynamics in epithelial cells by integrating experimental observations with an active vertex model. We demonstrate that while crowding is essential, it is not sufficient for glassy dynamics to emerge. A mechanochemical feedback loop (MCFL), mediated by cell shape changes through the contractile actomyosin network, is also required to drive glass transition in dense epithelial tissues, as revealed via a crosstalk between actin-based cell clustering and dynamic heterogeneity in experiments. Incorporating MCFL into the vertex model reveals that glassy dynamics can emerge even at high cellular activity if the strength of the MCFL remains high. We show that the MCFL can counteract cell division-induced fluidisation and enable glassy dynamics to emerge through active cell-to-cell communication. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the existence of novel collective mechanochemical oscillations that arise from the crosstalk of two MCFLs.

Low-beta (<20 Hz) events are very rare, high amplitude events, whereas high-beta (>20 Hz) is common but lower in amplitude. Both bands show state-specific anatomical distribution and modulation during a motor task: Low-beta is entirely absent during movement, whereas high-beta is only partially suppressed and reoccurs during postural maintenance. During post-movement beta rebound, low-beta event probability increases threefold, accompanied by strong low-beta event synchronization. A third state, probably corresponding to gamma activity, is active during task execution. Beta rebound occurs via a directed, sequential shift from gamma/active state via high-beta state to low-beta state. Our results provide strong experimental evidence for the coexistence of two functionally and anatomically distinct beta bands, and provide insights into their role in movement initiation, maintenance, and termination.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

K.; Roh, D.; Lee, K.; Kim, H. W.; Oh, S. B.", "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury can lead to chronic mechanical hypersensitivity, yet the severity and persistence of pain are strongly influenced by the extent of axonal damage. Notably, partial sciatic nerve crush injury (PCI) produces persistent tactile hypersensitivity despite a less severe anatomical insult than full crush injury (FCI), yet the identity and post-injury state of the fibers that persist after PCI remain unclear. To define sensory neuron populations contributing to PCI-induced tactile hypersensitivity, we combined fiber-specific transgenic labeling (Thy1-YFP for A{beta} mechanoreceptors and Nav1.8-tdTomato for nociceptors) with pharmacological silencing using QX-314 coapplied with TRPV1 (capsaicin) and TLR5 (flagellin) agonists to selectively manipulate fiber subtypes. At day 7 after PCI, Nav1.8+ nociceptive terminals were still detectable in the hind paw. On day 30, acute silencing of TRPV1+ afferents transiently reduced mechanical hypersensitivity, indicating nociceptor activity in its maintenance. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of retrogradely labeled DRG neurons showed that remaining medium-diameter neurons exhibited reduced rheobase and increased action potential firings in response to step current injections. Besides, electrical stimulation of nociceptive fibers increased pERK expression in the spinal dorsal horn, indicating enhanced nociceptive signaling after PCI. Early ablation of TRPV1+ fibers with high-dose capsaicin during degeneration phase prevented the subsequent development of long-term tactile hypersensitivity. Collectively, our results suggest that spared nociceptors after PCI remain sensitized even during nerve repair, driving long-term tactile hypersensitivity. Targeting these spared nociceptive fibers after nerve injury may offer a potential strategy for preventing chronic pain associated with traumatic nerve injury.\n\nGraphical Summary\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=131 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/687306v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (54K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cffee4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1676498org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd6c31org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ca2024_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Non- or minimally verbal children, in whom language has not developed by school-age in either production or comprehension, thus provide an unparalleled window into the human brain when it is deprived of language function. Yet insights from functional MRI are absent. Here we report results from a first study of intrinsic connectivity in 9 non- or minimally verbal children with autism spectrum disorder (nvASD) scanned under sedation with propofol along with 8 typically developing children (scanned awake), using resting-state (rs) fMRI. We targeted both functional (FC) and anatomically constrained, generative effective connectivity (GEC) in the speech and language networks, the insula and associated networks, and the hippocampus. Identical analyses were applied to an independent rsMRI dataset of healthy adults scanned both under propofol and while awake, to evaluate sedation confounds. NvASDs compared to their neurotypical peers showed a widespread pattern of hypoconnectivity in auditory speech perception, frontotemporal, and semantic processing regions, which extended further to the insula, and the hippocampus. GEC results selectively replicated these patterns, which correlated with autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS) behavioral scores within the nvASD group. This hypoconnectivity pattern extended neither to the adults scanned under propofol, nor to the visual cortex used as control region in nvASD, suggesting that this pattern of results could not be explained by sedation. Together, this first evidence from intrinsic connectivity reveals a broad pattern of underconnectivity across key cognitive networks, which provides a neural correlate for the significant breakdown of language-related cognitive functions in this population.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Although {zeta}-KO eliminates neocortical LTP, hippocampal LTP may be sustained by another aPKC, {iota}/{lambda} (PKC{iota}). PKC{iota} is critical for the generation of an early phase of LTP and short-term memory, and its genetic deletion is compensated by PKM{zeta}. Using a double knockout strategy, deleting both PKC{iota} and PKM{zeta} ({iota}/{zeta}-dKO) in hippocampus, we report that {iota}/{zeta}-dKO eliminates enduring LTP and spatial long-term memory but shows an early-phase, short-lasting LTP and short-term memory. ZIP, an inhibitor of both PKM{zeta} and PKC{iota} that disrupts LTP in WT and PKM{zeta}-null hippocampus, does not affect LTP in {iota}/{zeta}-dKO hippocampus, suggesting ZIP disrupts LTP by targeting PKM{zeta} or PKC{iota}. Thus, the double-KO reveals that additional compensatory short-term processes can be induced without aPKCs, whereas additional long-term processes cannot.

Here, we show that compaction of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), governed by mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) abundance and mtATP-dependent remodeling, defines the transcriptional and functional state of trained macrophages. While typical pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMPs) triggered mtDNA accessibility, Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) effector PE18 directly interacted with and activated SLC25A5 to reduce mtATP levels, thereby inhibiting TFAM degradation by AFG3L2. Accumulated TFAM restricts mtDNA accessibility, suppressing the transcription of the mtNd1 and thereby reducing mtNd1-mediated mtROS production, which diminishes the trained capacity of macrophages against secondary infections. Notably, BCG{Delta}pe18 maintains macrophages cytokine transcriptional capacity independent of classical nuclear histone modifications.

Clinically, high-fat diets and gut-derived endotoxins (from enteric dysbiosis) act as additional \"hits\" that exacerbate alcohol-induced liver injury. Moreover, alcohol metabolism generates oxidative stress and modifies self-proteins into neo-antigens, potentially triggering immune responses. A model that incorporates these elements is critical for studying ALD pathogenesis and its immunological aspects.\n\nMETHODSMale Wistar rats were randomized into four groups. The AL group received alcohol (36% caloric equivalent) and a single LPS dose (1 {micro}g/kg) 24 hours before sacrifice. The AF group was fed a high-fat diet (35% caloric equivalent) for 15 days, then maintained on alcohol and fat. The ALF group was similarly primed with fat, maintained on alcohol and fat, and given LPS prior to sacrifice. The ICC group served as isocaloric controls. Liver injury was assessed via histology, biochemical markers (AST, ALT, MDA), and serum endotoxin levels. Antibody titers against liver proteins were analyzed by ELISA; neo-antigens were identified using proteomics.\n\nRESULTSAll treated groups showed elevated liver enzymes, MDA, and endotoxin levels, indicating progressive liver damage. The ALF group exhibited the most severe pathology within six weeks, progressing from steatosis to steatohepatitis and fibrosis. In contrast, the AF group showed steatosis alone, and the AL group displayed moderate inflammation. Neo-antigens were most abundant in the ALF group.\n\nCONCLUSIONWe present a novel, rapid-onset triple-hit model of ALD that mimics the diseases full spectrum. This model enables mechanistic studies on how diet and gut-derived endotoxins contribute to ALD and highlights the immunogenic potential of alcohol-induced neo-antigens.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

This study pioneers a novel approach focusing solely on the disease association degree between miRNAs and their target genes. We propose that this single feature is sufficient for distinguishing experimentally validated functional MTIs from sequence-based predicted MTIs in a binary classification task. To quantify miRNA-gene disease association, we fine-tuned Sentence-BERT to generate disease description embeddings and compute their semantic similarity. Remarkably, using only disease association features, miRTarDS achieved an F1 score of 0.88 on the task of distinguishing functional from predicted MTIs in the external validation set. The approach also exhibits generalizability across different gene-disease association databases.

Current sequence-based models, such as Enformer and Borzoi, trained exclusively on the reference genome, cannot capture the effects of individual-specific regulatory variants. Moreover, the acquisition of paired whole-genome and transcriptome data required for personalized modeling is hindered by privacy and data-sharing constraints. To address this limitation, we integrate genomic data synthesis with established statistical frameworks. Our approach generates thousands of virtual training samples by simulating genetic variation from the 1000 Genomes Project and assigning pseudo-expression labels using PrediXcan, a validated eQTL-based predictor. Because simulated and real expression values differ in scale and distribution, we introduce a preference-based objective that models relative rather than absolute expression patterns. Fine-tuning Enformer through alternating cycles of real-data regression and virtualdata preference optimization enables efficient learning from both real and synthesized data. Using the GEUVADIS dataset, our framework outperforms AlphaGenome, PrediXcan, and Enformer fine-tuned without synthesized data, demonstrating that simulation-based integration of population-level regulatory knowledge can effectively mitigate data scarcity and improve cross-individual generalization in sequence-based gene expression prediction.\n\nAvailability and implementation: Code and data are available at https://github.com/pacifiic/augment-finetune-genomics.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Background: Although antiretroviral therapies (ART) have substantially reduced HIV-associated mortality, the increased lifespan achieved by widespread ART deployment has revealed that HIV infection is linked to an unexplained earlier onset and increased incidence of aging-associated conditions like sarcopenia. Complex syndromes, like sarcopenia, often arise from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, so in this study, we investigated effects of short-term treatment with emtricitabine (2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine; FTC), an FDA approved ART, on skeletal muscle DNA methylation patterns and transcriptome-wide responses in a male murine model of HIV phenotypic biology (Tg26 mice). Methods: We treated 6 month old male Tg26 (+/-) mice or wildtype (WT) littermates on a C57BL/6 genetic background with FTC in the drinking water for one month; control groups received drinking water vehicle alone (VEH). Muscle function and body composition were measured longitudinally. Skeletal muscle methylation patterns, transcriptional changes, and histological features were quantified at sacrifice. Results: Although neither gross structural nor functional muscle deficits were observed in this short-term study with ART usage, relative decreases in muscle endurance measured by hang time over the study were 2-fold more severe in the Tg26 as compared to WT mice (p=0.0453), and markers of myogenic cell maturation (Myf5, Myf6) were disrupted in the Tg26 HIV model as compared to WT littermates in a manner exacerbated by FTC treatment. Fat mass, measured by DXA, also tended (p=0.085) to be uniquely increased by FTC treatment in the Tg26 mice over the study. Differential methylation patterns and pathway enrichment data suggested that the presence of an HIV phenotype and exposure to an ART regimen altered the methylation status in skeletal muscle genes such as Camk2B, Pcolce2 and Lima1 in a manner consistent with promoting eventual functional impairment in muscle. Additionally, RNAseq revealed differential gene expression profiles and key regulatory pathways including cellular differentiation, regulation of lipid metabolism, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. Lipodystrophy-related genes including LEP, ADIPOQ and PPAR involved in fat distribution and metabolism along with skeletal genes related to regulation of muscle strength were affected by the presence of an HIV phenotype and ART treatment. Conclusions: The current study provides insights into mechanisms by which a clinically relevant ART may influence DNA methylation and transcriptome changes in skeletal muscle in the context of HIV biology. The differentially regulated pathways suggest novel targets for understanding, and eventually abrogating, the harmful effects of long-term ART use in PLWH on skeletal muscle mass and function.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we revisit this question through quantitative integration of single-cell transcriptomic, chromatin accessibility, spatial, and lineage-tracing analyses across the proximal-to-distal axis of the small intestinal epithelium. Our data show that under homeostatic conditions, Lgr5 cells exclusively sustain epithelial self-renewal in nearly all crypt-villus units along the entire length of the small intestine, a process for which R-spondin is indispensable. Following irradiation or chemotoxic injury, surviving Lgr5 cells and their progeny reprogram into transient fetal-like cell states that initiate epithelial repair. Crucially, successful regeneration depends on the reactivation of canonical WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling, as evidenced by increased TCF motif accessibility and upregulation of WNT target genes in newly forming Lgr5+ stem cells. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of WNT signaling blocks the reconstitution of Lgr5 cells and crypt regeneration, leading to epithelial collapse. These findings reconcile prior controversies by demonstrating the central role of Lgr5 CBC cells in epithelial self-renewal and regeneration following injury.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

The Drosophila model of MPS VII, generated by deleting the fly {beta}-GUS ortholog CG2135, exhibits hallmark neuropathological features, including dopaminergic neuron loss, brain vacuolisation, and impaired locomotor performance. Using this CG2135-/- fly, we recently showed that impaired autophagosome formation and their turnover led to abnormal accumulation of damaged mitochondria and lipofuscins in the brain. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of this autophagy defect and found that Mitf (the TFEB homolog), the transcriptional regulator of autophagy, is markedly downregulated in CG2135-/- fly brains, accompanied by reduced expression of its target genes, including LAMP1, CLN3, and v-ATPase subunits. Guided by these observations, we assessed whether boosting Mitf activity could ameliorate neuropathology. Interestingly, oral trehalose treatment reactivated Mitf and its downstream autophagy gene network in CG2135-/- fly brains, restoring autophagosome biogenesis, reducing lipofuscin accumulation, and alleviating apoptosis. Trehalose treatment also improved locomotor performance, indicating a clear mitigation of neurodegeneration.

In budding yeast, spindle breakdown at mitotic exit depends on Cdk1 inactivation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of stabilizing factors, including the kinesin-5 Cin8 and the crosslinker Ase1/PRC1. Timely degradation of Cin8 by APCCdh1 prevents spindle over-elongation and deformation. We have identified SUMOylation and the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase Slx5 as regulators of this process. Cin8 is SUMOylated and interacts with Slx5, suggesting that it is a substrate of Slx5. Deletion of the SLX5 gene or expression of a SUMOylation-defective Cin8 mutant cause spindle disassembly defects resembling those of degradation-resistant Cin8 mutants. Reduction of Cin8 SUMOylation partly stabilizes spindles in ase1{triangleup} cells. In addition, SUMOylation of Cin8 and Slx5 are required for timely Cin8 clearance from the mitotic spindle and actomyosin-ring contraction. We propose that SUMOylation regulates Cin8 activity and that SUMO-targeted ubiquitylation facilitates removal Cin8 from the spindle, promoting spindle disassembly at the end of mitosis.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Recent reports showed that aging promotes the emergence of non-canonical (nc) megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs) directly from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), leading to the production of hyperactive Plts. The higher engraftment potential of ncMkPs compared to both young and old canonical (c)MkPs, contrasts with the functional decline of old HSCs. Emerging reports suggest that mitochondrial function critically regulates lineage commitment and cellular functionality, but how mitochondrial activity affects aging megakaryopoiesis is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that aged MkPs sustain unique mitochondrial activity, characterized by higher mitochondrial membrane potential, higher ATP content, and lower ROS levels compared to their younger counterparts. This contrasts with the dysfunctional mitochondrial state observed in old HSCs, suggesting lineage-specific organelle adaptations upon aging. Notably, we observed that the elevated mitochondrial capacity in aged MkPs is driven selectively by the age-specific ncMkPs. Paradoxically, in vivo pharmacological enhancement of mitochondrial activity in old mice reduced in situ Plt production, but increased Plt reconstitution by transplanted HSCs. These discoveries link uniquely regulated mitochondrial capacity to the intrinsic properties of age-specific MkPs, raising the possibility of therapeutic targeting to prevent aging-induced megakaryopoiesis.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

To address the mechanisms underlying assembly and regulation of BLTP complexes, we used cryo-EM to resolve the structure of one such BLTP, the Parkinsons protein VPS13C, at near-atomic resolution. The structure identifies a lipid-transfer-nonpermissive conformation, where the built-in C-terminal VAB adaptor module blocks the end of the lipid transfer bridge, interfering with lipid delivery. We also identify calmodulin, central to calcium signaling, as a VPS13 partner, suggesting calcium regulation of VPS13 function.

For example, the risk of T2D is higher in males than in premenopausal females, whereas the risk of T2D-associated cardiovascular disease is higher in females. The sex-dependent mechanisms of T2D pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Publicly available human islet datasets, such as HPAP and Humanislets.com, offer a valuable tool for uncovering the impact of biological sex on islet structure, gene expression, and function at a scale that was not previously possible. We performed an integrated analysis of data from publicly available sources to identify sex differences in baseline islet characteristics in donors without diabetes and subsequently examined these features in donors who lived with T2D. Among donors without diabetes, female islets had a greater proportion of alpha-cells compared with male islets and showed enriched expression of ribosomal and mitochondrial pathways in both beta- and alpha-cells. Measurements of mitochondrial function in female islets revealed lower spare respiratory capacity compared to male islets due to higher basal respiration. Male and female islets had distinct changes in gene and protein expression in the context of T2D with female islets having greater preservation of insulin content and fewer defects in islet function. Together, these data show female islets have fewer islet impairments in T2D. This highlights the need for detailed mechanistic studies in both sexes to support effective and sex-informed interventions for T2D.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

However, it remains unclear whether learning-evoked sensory responses in these structures are modality-specific, or whether they represent a more generalized signal for modality-independent but behaviorally relevant stimuli. To address this question, we performed widefield calcium imaging while mice were trained on sensorimotor tasks involving either visual or auditory stimuli, with mice first learning one modality and then switching to the other. We found that the anterior PFC (aPFC) exhibited a bilateral response to both visual and auditory stimuli after learning the respective tasks, indicating a generalized sensory representation. In contrast, the medial PFC (mPFC) showed modality-specific activity, responding only to contralateral visual stimuli after learning. Mice were able to learn sensorimotor associations for both modalities in sequence, and were only able to transfer learned behavior from visual to auditory stimuli but not the reverse. Despite differences in cross-modal learning transfer, cortical responses to learned stimuli were the same regardless of learning order. In contrast, electrophysiological recordings in the anterior striatum revealed that visually responsive regions became co-responsive to auditory stimuli only in mice trained on the visual task first. The additional auditory responses arose from distinct neurons rather than those previously responsive to visual stimuli, indicating that co-responsiveness occurred at the regional rather than single-neuron level. Together, these findings reveal that learned sensory responses in the PFC and striatum uniquely dissociate modality and learning order, suggesting a divergence in their roles during sensorimotor learning.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Growth cones (GCs) play essential roles in establishing connectivity patterns, yet their proteomic composition during this dynamic developmental phase remains poorly characterized. Here, we performed comprehensive proteomic profiling of GCs isolated from the whole hippocampus (HP-GCs) and dentate gyrus (DG-GCs) across the first five postnatal days (P1, P3, P5) in mice. Mass spectrometry and proteomic analysis revealed that GCs from both regions are highly similar at P1, subsequently diverging. This earliest timepoint seems to be characterized by a high metabolic demand. Developmental trajectories of the GCs from the two subregions then start to differ, with P3 being a very dynamic period for HP-GCs, with GO terms related to RNA splicing, and a transition towards synapse formation by P5. On the contrary, DG-GCs seem to still be in an exploratory phase by P5, suggesting a delayed maturation and reflecting the later time course of the invasion of EC layer 2 Reelin-positive axons into this region. We identified over 5,000 proteins, with each timepoint characterized by distinct protein subsets. Temporal trajectory analysis revealed key GC markers including DCC, DPSYL2, and FABP7, which showed dynamic regulation across development. Notably, we identified multiple proteins containing nuclear localization sequences, suggesting bidirectional communication between GCs and the nucleus during critical developmental periods. Furthermore, our dataset contains over 400 proteins associated with neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, with twenty showing temporal regulation, highlighting the potential relevance of early developmental disruptions to disease pathogenesis.

Songbirds provide a unique model to study the neural mechanisms of speech learning and production. Recent evidence highlights a contribution of the cerebellum to syllable duration in songbirds. Here, we aim at better understanding how and which cerebellar circuits may contribute to the tight control of syllable duration in zebra finches. We first confirmed that lesions in the lateral cerebellum affect syllable duration. We then recorded neuronal activity in the various cerebellar lobules in response to song playback and during singing with or without auditory feedback perturbation. We found that many cerebellar lobules receive non-selective auditory information locked to syllable boundaries during song playback, both in anaesthetized and awake behaving birds. During singing, cerebellar neurons in several lobules display song-locked responses with varying degrees of alignment to their playback responses and no alteration during auditory feedback perturbation. Singing-related activity tends to correlate with the fluctuations in syllable duration rather than any acoustic song feature. Importantly, neurons in lobule IV of the cerebellum are largely unaffected by auditory stimulation but display syllable-locked firing rate modulations during singing that precisely encode syllable boundaries with a sharp and tight increase in firing at syllable onsets and offsets. Altogether, our findings reveal cerebellar signals that may contribute to the control of the duration of vocal elements during singing, possibly serving as a forward model of song temporal features.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

In humans, there are dozens of tentative candidate loci for balancing selection, but only a handful of well-characterized examples, which are either evolutionarily recent alleles or ancient variants shared across species identical by descent (\"trans-species polymorphisms\"). Here, we look for evidence of balancing selection over a range of timescales, by taking an approach that does not rely on a demographic model or assumptions about the specific mode of balancing selection. Analyzing whole genome sequencing data from 2504 humans and 59 chimpanzees, we identify common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are identical in the two species. This set includes recurrent mutations, a subset of which may be maintained by balancing selection in one or both species, as well as potential trans-species polymorphisms. Using allele ages estimated from ancestral recombination graph reconstructions in humans, we show that shared SNPs are enriched for older alleles as compared to matched human SNPs that are not shared with chimpanzees. On this basis, we estimate that balancing selection has maintained over one thousand alleles in humans longer than expected by chance. Moreover, we identify over 50 trans-species polymorphisms, including an intriguing case that includes an eQTL for the gene MUC7. However, we also estimate a minimum false discovery rate for any allele age cut-off of ~70%; as we show, even among the trans-species polymorphisms, many may be shared between humans and chimpanzees simply by chance.

Genes such as LSD1 have emerged as intriguing non-APL AML differentiation therapy targets, but results as monoagents in clinical trials have been mixed. Here, we performed differentiation-specific CRISPR screens to identify targets whose inhibition synergizes with LSD1 inhibition to induce terminal differentiation of non-APL AML cells. Intriguingly, the MLL co-factor Menin scored as the top hit. Using cell lines, primary patient samples, and mouse AML models, we find that dual inhibition of LSD1 and Menin is a highly promising approach for differentiation therapy. Mechanistically, we determine that inhibition of Menin downregulates drivers of proliferation and stemness such as MEIS1, and inhibition of LSD1 induces inflammatory and interferon-related pro-myeloid differentiation expression programs.

However, it has remained unexplored when and how these stage-specific functions evolved. Here, we perform the first functional analysis of stomatal regulators from non-angiosperm vascular plants by using fern Ceratopteris richardii and gymnosperm Picea abies as model species.

These factors are likely to share a common ancestral gene with angiosperm SPCH and MUTE, and angiosperm FAMA, respectively. Our work shows that C.fern and spruce SM and FAMA can promote gene functions resembling angiosperm SPCH and MUTE, and FAMA functions, respectively. However, all the four proteins display ability to drive asymmetric entry divisions in the stomatal lineage characteristic previously associated specifically to angiosperm SPCH.

We found that loss-of-function mutations in the blue light receptor MpPHOT led to epinasty, while loss-of-function mutations in the red light receptor MpPHY resulted in hyponasty. We hypothesize that these antagonistic activities of blue and red light signalling are balanced in white light, resulting in the development of flat thalli. Using time-resolved transcriptomics, we identified genes that were rapidly induced upon light exposure. Among these genes were all six members of the M. polymorpha BBX gene family. Mutants harbouring loss-of-function mutations in two of the six MpBBX transcription factors developed defective thallus tropisms. Mpbbx1 loss-of-function mutants formed hyponastic thalli, while Mpbbx5 loss-of-function mutants developed epinastic thalli. Double mutants Mpbbx1 Mpbbx5 grew flat, supporting the hypothesis that they function antagonistically.

Although the Asteraceae family is one of the largest and economically important plant groups, little information is available about its pattern-triggered immunity signaling. Cultivated lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) recognizes a 24-amino acid peptide (nlp24) from necrosis- and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins (NLPs) found in bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes. Here, we perform an extensive characterization of nlp24-induced immune responses in lettuce and identify the LETTUCE nlp24 RECEPTOR (LNR) as the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase mediating its recognition. Remarkably, nlp24 recognition in lettuce and subsequent activation of defenses strongly depend on the conserved heptapeptide motif (GHRHDWE). Structural modeling-guided mutagenesis experiments suggest that residues in the nlp24 heptapeptide interact with a hydrophobic pocket in the LNR solenoid structure. Divergent ligand specificities and the absence of sequence homology between LNR and Arabidopsis nlp24-recognizing receptor indicate that the NLP recognition in lettuce and Arabidopsis emerged independently, through convergent evolution. Our phylogenetic analysis shows that LNR is closely related to Arabidopsis MIK2 (MALE DISCOVERER 1-INTERACTING RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 2), but belongs to a distinct, Asteraceae-specific monophyletic subgroup that has undergone a significant expansion in Lactuca. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of pattern-triggered immunity in lettuce and the fast evolution of its immune receptor repertoire. On the translational side, our findings open opportunities for the crop defense improvement via interfamily transfer.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

C.; Keeney, S.", "abstract": "Despite being essential for fertility, many proteins involved in meiotic homologous recombination have diverged rapidly. The evolutionary forces driving this divergence remain mostly unknown, in part because of challenges in accounting for the interplay of sequence changes with constraints imposed by proteins' structures and physiological roles. Here, we explore strategies to more sensitively detect signatures of positive or relaxed selection by integrating evolutionary analyses with structural and functional information, using meiotic recombination proteins in four taxa--primates, rodents, birds and budding yeasts. By mapping selection rate estimates onto predicted protein structures, we characterized protein regions likely to have experienced positive selection. We further identified subtle sequence variation within protein domains that are well conserved generally because of structural constraints. To detect sequence variation masked by these constraints, we analyzed selection at structurally matched residues, comparing homologs across different lineages as well as between meiosis-specific and generalist paralogs. These approaches identified lineage- and paralog-restricted enrichment of non-synonymous substitutions that may indicate loss of functional constraints and/or adaptive innovation. Finally, we used cross-species complementation experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to show that sequence variation in the pro-crossover factor MSH4 modulates recombination proficiency. We suggest that evolutionary plasticity per se is a key conserved characteristic of the meiotic recombination machinery. More generally, our approach provides a mechanistic framework to analyze protein evolution.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we map the genetic basis of a newly described iridescence trait in swordtail fish to a single locus. Individuals with this trait appear to sparkle as they move through the water. We find that the trait is driven by the recent endogenization of a retrovirus that inserted near the gene alkal2a. This insertion is associated with changes in the chromatin landscape, upregulation of alkal2a, and accumulation of iridescent cells that adhere to the scales. Rather than causing diseases, our results demonstrate that invading endogenous retroviruses can also regulate novel trait variation in the host.

However, modification of ACh release could also be a direct mechanism for the expression of cortical plasticity. Here, we combine widefield and 2-photon imaging in head-fixed mice to show that visual fear conditioning leads to a selective, cue-dependent release of ACh in primary visual cortex that enhances visually-evoked neuronal responses via excitation of layer 1 GABAergic interneurons and resulting disinhibition of local excitatory pyramidal neurons. Cholinergic signaling through muscarinic receptors in visual cortex is necessary for both the enhanced visual response and conditioned fear behavior. Our results demonstrate a novel capacity for conditioned release of ACh in sensory cortex to serve as a mechanism for sensory-guided behavioral learning. Rather than acting as a simple gate, cortical neuromodulation may thus play a central role in the expression of learned behavior.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Following fertilisation, DNA methylation inherited from gametes must be reprogrammed to establish totipotency and enable the parental-to-zygotic transition. To accomplish this, non-mammalian vertebrates such as zebrafish and medaka subtly reprogram maternal 5mC profiles while maintaining high methylation levels throughout embryogenesis. In contrast, eutherian mammals such as mouse and human undergo global 5mC erasure in both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages. However, while embryonic 5mC is rapidly re-established to high levels upon implantation, the trophectoderm, which gives rise to the placenta, displays sustained and conserved DNA hypomethylation, suggesting that this drastic 5mC erasure may be functionally linked to complex placentation in mammals. To clarify whether extensive post-fertilisation 5mC erasure co-evolved with placentation, we explored embryonic methylation dynamics in marsupials, a lineage of therian mammals with a short-lived placenta. We produced a near complete telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genome and generated detailed epigenome maps of embryonic development for an Australian marsupial, the fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata). We found the dunnart embryo exhibits genome wide DNA demethylation at the blastocyst stage, but these changes occur in the trophectoderm only, suggesting that 5mC erasure in the placenta is an ancestral state in therian mammals. Furthermore, the T2T-level dunnart genome assembly enabled identification of sex chromosomes, uncovering extensive hypomethylation of the paternally-inherited inactive X chromosome in females and revealing the previously unannotated master regulator of X chromosome inactivation, lncRNA Rsx. Our data indicate that while the use of genome-wide 5mC erasure differs between eutherian and marsupial lineages, 5mC erasure in extraembryonic tissue is ancestral to therian mammals and may be necessary to support placental development.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the first evidence of H5 IAV infections in wild bats globally, focusing on common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in coastal areas of Peru. Longitudinal serological screening, stable isotope analysis and metabarcoding revealed repeated exposures to H5 IAVs in vampire bats which feed on coastal wildlife species heavily impacted by the 2.3.4.4b epizootic, but no evidence of infection in populations without access to marine prey. We further report bat gene flow between IAV-exposed and IAV-naive populations, and IAV infections in a vampire bat colony that fed on both marine and terrestrial livestock prey, providing insights into how future IAV epizootics might spread spatially within bats and between marine and terrestrial ecosystems if a bat reservoir were established. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the H5 haemagglutinin protein binds to the upper respiratory tract of vampire bats, suggesting bat tissue susceptibility to H5 IAVs. Finally, vampire bat-derived kidney, liver, and lung cells supported entry, replication, and egress of avian and mammalian 2.3.4.4b viruses, confirming cellular infectivity. These results illustrate how combining ecological inference and experimental virology can pinpoint the species origins and biological significance of viral spillover at species interfaces.

We describe a mutant with an unusual progression of senescence and identify it as an allele of ethylene-dependent gravitropism-deficient and yellow-green 1 (egy1-5). EGY1 encodes a chloroplast-localized metalloprotease that regulates chlorophyll metabolism. The single egy1-5 mutant exhibits defects in various aspects of chloroplast function, including abnormal accumulation of photosynthetic complexes, defects in photosynthetic electron transfer chain and altered responses to the chemicals methyl viologen and lincomycin. Additionally, egy1 lacks guard cell chloroplasts. We performed a suppressor mutant screen in the egy1 background to identify new regulators of senescence and chloroplast development. We found two suppressors that restored green leaves and mapping revealed that both suppressors had mutations in STAY-GREEN 1 (SGR1). SGR1 encodes the Mg2+ dechelatase enzyme, which catalyses the first step in chlorophyll breakdown. Several defects in the egy1 mutant were either fully or partially suppressed in egy1 sgr1. This enabled the function of EGY1 to be isolated, independent of the pleiotropic effects of chlorophyll degradation.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, HO1/HY1/GUN2 predominantly functions for heme catabolism among the HO isoforms. Our previous study demonstrated that HO1 localization is altered in plastids or in the cytosol due to transcriptional start-site regulation. Introduction of either plastid- or cytosol-localized HO1 into HO1-deficient mutants (gun2 and hy1-1) resulted in recovery from the long hypocotyl, low pigmentation, and genomes uncoupling (gun) phenotypes, indicating the assembly of functional phytochromes (PHYs), as well as supporting the retrograde heme signaling hypothesis. To dissect the heme signaling and PHY assembly, in this study, we introduced either of the two types of regiospecific bacterial HOs that produce biliverdin IX (BVIX) or BVIX{beta}/{delta} into Arabidopsis hy1-1. Gene introduction of either plastid- or cytosol-localized BVIX-producing HO complemented the long hypocotyl, low pigmentation, and gun phenotypes of hy1-1. Interestingly, the introduction of BVIX{beta}/{delta}-producing HO, either in the plastid or in the cytosol, failed to complement the long hypocotyl and low pigmentation phenotypes, suggesting failure of functional PHY assembly. However, these lines restored the gun phenotype, thus supporting the heme signaling hypothesis. Based on the levels of complementation of the gun phenotype, we found that the expression of photosynthesis-associated nuclear genes (PhANGs) can be separated into PHY-dependent and -independent groups. Our results demonstrate that heme functions as a retrograde mobile biogenic signal from plastids, passing through the cytosol, to regulate the expression of PhANGs, and this regulation is distinct in its dependency of PHY.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

These regulatory complexes rely on interactions with sequence-specific DNA binding proteins, such as the small family of TELOMERE REPEAT BINDING FACTORS (TRBs). TRBs are components of chromatin regulatory complexes with opposing functions, such as the epigenetic repressors Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) and a JMJ14/NAC complex that respectively add and removes the repressive H3K27me3 and positive H3K4me3 modification, but also with the plant-specific PEAT complex that is linked to histone acetylation and gene activation. We dissected the partial redundancy between TRB1, TRB2 and TRB3 in target gene selection and interaction with different chromatin regulatory complexes. High redundancy of TRBs is suggested by major phenotypic changes that are only observed trb triple mutants; however, we found different target site preference between TRB1-3 and preferred partnership with chromatin complexes. Furthermore, TRB paralogs interacted with the NuA4 histone acetylation complex, both together with and in absence of PEAT. Among the three paralogs, TRB1 had more unique binding sites and correlated stronger with PEAT and NuA4 functions. In contrast, TRB2 and TRB3 were more dependent on the presence of bona fide telo-box motifs and were more likely to be found at PRC2 associated sites. Overall, we provide insight into the diverse roles of TRBs in epigenetic gene regulation and how their diversification contributes to their apparent redundancy, as well as their observed activating and repressing effects on gene expression.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Axis-specific and boundary-localized expression patterns were validated by in situ hybridisation. We identified dorsal-specific candidate targets of AmCYC and ventral-specific genes regulated by AmDIV, including factors with regionally restricted expression along the proximal-distal axis.

EEG was recorded while participants viewed long-lasting (2s) Gabor patches. Using a phase-dependent decoding approach, we extracted EEG activity at specific alpha phases and quantified stimulus decoding accuracy. Decoding performance varied systematically with alpha phase, following a smooth unimodal profile that peaked over occipito-parietal electrodes. These effects emerged well after stimulus onset, indicating a sustained modulation of visual processing during continuous input. Our findings demonstrate that visual information is encoded more accurately at specific alpha phases. This provides direct evidence that sensory processing is gated by intrinsic brain activity and introduces a generalizable decoding framework for linking oscillatory phase to neural information processing.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

In our study, 35 minimally verbal autistic adolescents and adults were presented with spoken or written words, followed by a pair of images (target and foil) as their eye movements were recorded. The majority (83%) of mvASD participants demonstrated hidden receptive language and reading abilities, with eye gaze performance, including time course and spatial displacement, comparable to neurotypical controls. In contrast, the same mvASD individuals averaged only 57% accuracy when asked to point to the target, revealing a significant gap between reporting via pointing and actual lexical-semantic knowledge. Furthermore, pupil dilation analysis during tasks indicated reduced arousal recruitment in mvASD participants, potentially implicating dysregulation of the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system associated with the performance gap between pointing and eye-gaze. These findings challenge assumptions of global intellectual limitation while confirming specific lexical-semantic competence among mvASD individuals.

It remains largely unknown how such immune mediators modulate the ECM scaffold immune environment and subsequent scaffold remodeling. In the present study, we co-delivered 3 distinct inflammatory immune adjuvants (cyclic di-AMP [CDA], monophosphoryl lipid A [MPLA], and granulocyte colony stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) with small intestinal submucosa (SIS) ECM in a murine volumetric muscle loss injury model, evaluating acute (1 week) and long-term (8-week) immune environments and scaffold remodeling. High parameter spectral cytometry, histologic analysis, and PCR revealed differential potentiation of the ECM scaffold microenvironment. Type 2 immune programs including IL-4, eosinophils, CD4 T cells, and CD206/CD86 macrophage ratios were induced in all ECM groups but attenuated by varying amounts with the CDA and MPLA co-delivery. By 8-weeks, inflammation had largely subsided, and histologically ECM with GM-CSF or MPLA showed the greatest degradation and remodeling into adipose tissue. These findings suggest that early pro-inflammatory compound delivery does not abrogate the ECM immune environment but does attenuate some programs while inducing others.

A state's likelihood increases sharply with its total biomass, or inverse self-inhibition. We develop a simplified model to predict and explain this behavior, by coarse-graining ecological interactions so that each stable state behaves as a unit. In this setting, we can accurately predict the entire landscape of stable states using only two macroscopic properties: the biomass of each state and species diversity. Our theory also provides insight into the biomass-likelihood relationship: High-biomass states have low self-inhibition and thus grow faster, outcompete others, and become much more likely.

These habitats are highly fragmented and vulnerable to invasion by non-native plants. Understanding where SAR and invasive plants overlap within the Carolinian Zone is essential to prioritize monitoring, control, and recovery efforts. We conducted a spatial co-occurrence analysis for non-fish SAR that depend on wetland or semi-aquatic habitat and invasive wetland plant species. Thirty-three species were identified as current (n = 26) or imminent (n = 7) invasion threats in Ontario's Carolinian. Spatial overlap between SAR and invasive plants was highest in coastal marshes and shallow open water habitats along Lake Erie where invasive plants are a well-recognized threat. It also identified urban areas (e.g., Toronto, Windsor, London, Niagara, etc.) with surprisingly high occurrence and richness of SAR. Demonstrated co-occurrence of SAR and invasive wetland plants in these areas means that invasive plant management in urban wetlands should contribute to SAR recovery plans. SAR such as marsh-nesting birds, reptiles, and wetland plants exhibited both the greatest exposure to invasive wetland plants and the greatest vulnerability to their impact mechanisms, such as habitat modifications and resource competition.

Objective: This study investigated the effects of 2-DG on proliferation, glycolytic activity, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in human bladder cancer cells to evaluate its potential as a therapeutic agent. Methods: Five human bladder cancer cell lines (RT112, 253J, T24, HT1197 and J82) were treated with increasing concentrations of 2-DG (0-20 mM) for up to 72 h. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay, and glycolytic activity was evaluated by measuring hexokinase (HK) activity and intracellular ATP levels. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry, and in vivo efficacy was examined using xenograft models in nude mice. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Results: 2-DG significantly reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner across all cell lines, concomitant with decreased HK activity and ATP production (p < 0.05). Treatment induced ROS accumulation and apoptosis, as evidenced by increased cleaved PARP and Bax expression and decreased p-Akt and Bcl-2 levels. In xenograft models, 2-DG treatment markedly suppressed tumor growth without apparent systemic toxicity. Conclusions: 2-DG exerts potent antitumor effects against bladder cancer by inhibiting glycolysis, inducing oxidative stress, and activating apoptotic pathways. These findings support the therapeutic potential of 2-DG as a metabolic-targeting strategy for bladder cancer.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Therefore, providing adequate and accessible nutrition is essential to positive farmed animal welfare. Billions of yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor; Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) are farmed as mini-livestock each year for use as food and feed. The major feedstock used, wheat bran, can sustain complete development of the species, but has been shown to have significantly lower protein content than yellow mealworms would typically self-select, particularly at early developmental stages. This can reduce growth, survival, and adult oviposition, and may contribute to high rates of cannibalistic behaviour among larvae (as larvae may have few options but to seek protein from the bodies of conspecifics). In this study, we use 20% nutritional yeast as a dietary protein supplement for larvae in early (0-4 weeks) and later life (4-8 weeks) to assess the effects on survival, growth rate, and rates of cannibalism, as well as any effects on growth, development timing, and adult body size. We also investigated the impact of this higher protein diet, when fed to either larvae or adults, on fecundity.

Therefore, providing adequate and accessible nutrition is essential to positive farmed animal welfare. Billions of yellow mealworms (Tenebrio molitor; Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) are farmed as mini-livestock each year for use as food and feed. The major feedstock used, wheat bran, can sustain complete development of the species, but has been shown to have significantly lower protein content than yellow mealworms would typically self-select, particularly at early developmental stages. This can reduce growth, survival, and adult oviposition, and may contribute to high rates of cannibalistic behaviour among larvae (as larvae may have few options but to seek protein from the bodies of conspecifics). In this study, we use 20% nutritional yeast as a dietary protein supplement for larvae in early (0-4 weeks) and later life (4-8 weeks) to assess the effects on survival, growth rate, and rates of cannibalism, as well as any effects on growth, development timing, and adult body size. We also investigated the impact of this higher protein diet, when fed to either larvae or adults, on fecundity.

L.", "abstract": "While central circuits governing sleep are well-studied, the contribution of signaling from peripheral tissues remains a critical yet less understood aspect of sleep regulation. The highly conserved RNA-binding protein Pumilio (Pum) is a post-transcriptional regulator expressed in multiple tissues that influence systemic physiology, but its role in modulating basal sleep has not been established. Although Pumilios function in central neurons has been linked to sleep homeostasis following deprivation, whether it regulates sleep through peripheral mechanisms remains unknown. Here, we use conditional genetic tools in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to demonstrate that Pumilio acts in the intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and the endocrinecorpus allatum (CA) to specifically regulate the transition to sleep. Reducing Pumilio function in either the ISCs or the CA independently and significantly accelerates nighttime sleep onset, while overexpression produces the opposite effect. This behavioral change is accompanied by widespread transcriptional alterations in the brain, characterized by a robust upregulation of genes involved in cellular stress responses, including Heat shock protein 83 (Hsp83). Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized gut-endocrine-brain signaling axis and identify peripheral post-transcriptional regulation as a key input to the central control of sleep behavior.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Approximately 90% of mouse rod photoreceptor dark current circulates in the SRS, and rod photoresponses materially alter SRS concentrations of permeant ions, especially K+. Following intravitreal injection of drugs that block glutamatergic synapses, and drugs that inhibit Kir4.1 and Kir7.1 channels expressed in Muller and RPE cells respectively, we measured electroretinograms (ERGs) in response to light flashes that completely suppress rod dark current, and compared ERG c-waves with predictions of a biophysical model of extracellular current sources generated by rod, Muller and RPE cells. SRS K+ fluxes in the dark steady-state were dominated by rods - NKX (-6.6 mM s-1), Kv2.1 channels (+5.4 mM s-1), NCKX (0.3 mM s-1) and HCN1 channel fluxes (1.0 mM s-1) - with much smaller contributions from Kir4.1 and Kir7.1 channels and trans-ELM and trans-RPE fluxes combining to zero net flux at resting SRS Ko of 5 mM (re 3.5 mM [K+] in blood plasma). In response to rod- saturating stimulation, Ko was predicted to decline to ~3.5 mM with a half-time of ~0.5 s, driven mainly by a hyperpolarization-dependent decline in Kv2.1 current. The kinetics and amplitude of the c-wave are explained by the decline in SRS K, which negatively shifts the Nernst potential of apical RPE Kir7.1 channels, increasing outward current that sinks through the paracellular resistance to basal Bestrophin and CFTR chloride channels causing a trans-epithelial potential of ~ 2 mV.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

N.; Adegoke, N.; Mao, Y.; Wilmott, J.; Liu, S.", "abstract": "Stain imputation in multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) imaging addresses the challenge of missing or damaged biomarker channels by reconstructing target biomarker images from a limited set of available stains. This approach offers a faster and more efficient alternative to full-panel staining, enabling detailed analysis of the tumour microenvironment. Existing One-Step Inference Models (OSIMs), primarily based on generative adversarial networks (GAN) or autoencoders, often generate suboptimal images with significant artifacts or reduced signal intensity. These limitations impair visual interpretability and reliability of the downstream immunotherapy response assessment. The challenge is further amplified when imputing cytoplasmic biomarkers such as CD8 from commonly used stains such as DAPI, due to the limited spatial correlation and the inherently complex structure of cytoplasmic signals. To address these limitations, we propose a self-refining diffusion model, OS2CR-Diff, which utilises the results from OSIMs as additional conditional representations. Unlike prior studies that rely on a single or limited conditional inputs, OS2CR-Diff incorporates three conditional inputs: the OSIM-imputed target biomarker image, OSIM-imputed complementary biomarker images, and non-antibody-stained images. Furthermore, we propose a feature fusion module that employs a cross-gated attention mechanism to effectively integrate these inputs, enabling context-aware feature refinement and improving the quality and reliability of imputed biomarker images. We evaluated OS2CR-Diff for CD8 biomarker imputation on mIF images of melanoma tissues. Our method outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 73.4% increase in the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), a 28.9% gain in the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), a 61.2% improvement in Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and significantly lower false positive rates compared to OSIM.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Q.; Kothare, M. V.; Sclocco, R.; Mahmoudi, B.", "abstract": "Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient gastric compartmental model that simulates diseased stomach function by altering antral-pyloric coordination and ``slow wave\" properties. The model evaluates motility, gastric emptying and mixing. The computational efficiency of the model enables broad parameter sweeps to simulate various pathological conditions, offering an alternative to computationally expensive finite element or finite volume approaches. Methods: We developed an extended compartmental model to simulate gastric function under dysrhythmic conditions. Building on prior work, this framework incorporates enhanced fluid flow equations and improved inter-compartment connectivity. These modifications enable simulation of impaired antro-pyloric coordination, regional variations in ``slow wave\" frequency (bradygastria, tachygastria), and reduced amplitude to mimic quiescent activity. Model outputs included gastric emptying rates, mixing efficiency, and transpyloric flow events across healthy and impaired conditions. Results: Simulations demonstrated that abnormal ``slow wave\" frequency or amplitude delays gastric emptying and diminishes mixing efficiency. Bradygastria induced retrograde transpyloric flow, reflecting backflow from intestine to stomach, a pathological marker. These disruptions were most pronounced when antro-pyloric coordination was impaired. Predictions aligned with prior experimental and computational findings, while model execution was approximately 50-fold faster than real-time gastric dynamics, highlighting computational efficiency. Conclusion: This physiologically inspired compartmental model captures the impact of ``slow wave\" abnormalities on gastric motility. By reproducing impaired flow and mixing patterns characteristic of diseased states, it provides a valuable tool for probing mechanisms of gastric dysfunction. Importantly, its computational efficiency positions the model for use in developing and rapid testing of model-based, closed-loop neurostimulation therapies for gastrointestinal disorders.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "QS-21, a saponin extract from the Chilean tree Quillaja saponaria, is gaining popularity as a potent vaccine adjuvant, but its production is constrained due to its low natural abundance and complex chemical structure of the triterpenoid saponins, which hinder large-scale production through plant extraction or chemical synthesis. Microbial biosynthesis presents a promising alternative, with Saccharomyces cerevisiae emerging as a desirable host for triterpenoid production. A key step toward microbial QS-21 synthesis is the efficient biosynthesis of its aglycone core, the triterpenoid quillaic acid. However, its efficient production remains limited by challenges of cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP450s) activity, including cofactor availability and electron transfer efficiency. To address this limitation, we applied a multi-faceted metabolic engineering strategy to optimise cytochrome CYP450 activity, including CYP450 expression and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) selection. Additionally, aligning CYP450 expression with the ethanol phase, enhanced the metabolic flux toward quillaic acid synthesis, leading to an 85-fold increase in titre. Together these strategies led to a quillaic acid titre of 385 {+/-} 14 mg/L in flask fermentation. Fed-batch bioreactor fermentations increased quillaic acid titre to 471 {+/-} 20 mg/L and significantly increased the selectivity for QA from 32.6% to 65.1% of the total triterpenoids produced. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of enhancing CYP450 activity through targeted strategies and reveal potential bottlenecks in CYP450 expression, providing valuable insights for future optimization of triterpenoid production in yeast.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Because packets vary in duration, this is not a rate code. A single neuron could encode very different stimuli depending on the number of spikes it produced per packet.

Thus, there is a need for a tool flexible enough to handle the full variety of read processing tasks, and fast and scalable enough to retain high performance on growing sequencing datasets.

Here, we introduce a computational framework for in silico cellular programming, enabling the simulation of lineage acquisition through gene-regulatory and functional feedback dynamics. Two paradigms of hepatic identity induction were modeled: direct programming, representing immediate activation of hepatocyte master regulators from an undifferentiated baseline, and reprogramming, representing the conversion of a lineage-committed fibroblast into a hepatocyte-like state. Each simulation integrates a minimal hepatocyte gene regulatory network comprising HNF4A, FOXA2, CEBPA, ALB, CYP3A4, and HNF1A with condition-dependent feedbacks reflecting metabolic and morphological stability. Comparative analyses reveal that direct programming rapidly converges to a stable hepatic attractor with low variance and tight network coherence, whereas reprogrammed trajectories display delayed stabilization, higher variance, and context-dependent adaptability. These findings demonstrate that functional maturity can be algorithmically achieved through feedback-driven regulatory dynamics, and that morphological order predicts metabolic coherence.

While design metaphors from control engineering are widely used to understand negative feedback in such systems, they are relatively uncommon for positive feedback, especially for biomolecular circuits. Here, we extended a block diagram modelling framework for the design of positive feedback. We found a quantitative design guideline for the strength of the positive feedback, which when wrapped around a saturation function can give a threshold and a hysteretic response. The critical feedback strength was inversely proportional to the saturation value and directly proportional to the input scale where saturation starts. We found that this saturation-threshold-hysteresis hierarchy persisted in a realistic model of a positively autoregulated gene. We showed how this classical model fitted well in a block diagram framework with multiplicative feedback and derived expressions for the critical feedback strength in terms of the saturation parameters. The dependence of the critical feedback on the parameters matched with the obtained design guideline.

However, it remains very challenging for these models to achieve accurate extrapolation when predicting functional effect of variants with positions or mutation types not seen in the training data. We propose that incorporating the physics of protein interactions and dynamics can be an effective approach to overcome the extrapolation limitations. Specifically, we demonstrate that physics-based modeling can be used to quantify the energetic effects of mutations and that incorporating these physical energetics directly within the convolution and graph convolution neural networks can significantly improve the performance of positional and mutational extrapolation compared to models without biophysics-inspired features. Our results support the effectiveness of leveraging physical knowledge in overcoming the limitation of data scarcity.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

L. L.", "abstract": "Understanding how genes interact with and regulate each other is a key challenge in systems biology. One of the primary methods to study this is through gene regulatory networks (GRNs). The field of GRN inference however faces many challenges, which necessitates effective tools for evaluating inference methods. For this purpose, data that corresponds to a known GRN, from various conditions and experimental setups is necessary, which is only possible to attain via simulation. Today, most existing tools for GRN-based simulation are limited either in network or data properties, with few or no options to modify these properties. To address these limitations we present GeneSNAKE, a Python package designed to allow users to generate biologically realistic GRNs, and expression data for benchmarking purposes. GeneSNAKE allows the user to control a wide range of network and data properties, including several distinct noise models. GeneSNAKE improves on previous work in the field by adding a perturbation model and a wide range of perturbation schemes along with the ability to control the noise and the perturbation strength. For benchmarking, GeneSNAKE offers a number of functions both for comparing network similarity, and properties in data and GRNs. These functions can further be used to study properties of biological data to produce simulated data with more realistic properties. GeneSNAKE is an open-source, comprehensive simulation and benchmarking package with powerful capabilities that are not combined in any other single package, and thanks to the Python implementation it can be extended and modified by users.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Existing machine learning approaches either use protein sequence, structure, or both. While structure-based deep learning models typically outperform sequence-based methods, they often require high computational cost or ligand-specific data, forcing a trade-off between accuracy and scalability. We present AstraBIND, a lightweight graph neural network that bridges this gap by integrating protein sequence, structure (experimental or predicted), and homology information to predict ligand classes and binding residues within minutes. The model employs a GATv2 architecture with 0.9M parameters, trained on ~250,000 curated protein-ligand complexes across 16 ligand categories. By encoding residue-level features and spatial geometry through graph attention, AstraBIND identifies binding residues and ligand types while maintaining structural consistency. In benchmarking, AstraBIND achieved a weighted macro-F1 of 0.47 across all ligand classes, with top performance for nucleotides (F1 = 0.79), porphyrins (0.74), and cofactors (0.73). Case studies, including p53 and CRFR1, demonstrate robust pocket localization for diverse proteins. Combined with its minimal inference time and broad ligand coverage, AstraBIND enables rapid in-silico screening and integration into laboratory workflows. Together with other Astra ML models, it represents a step toward real-time protein design and validation pipelines.

To investigate the physical principles underlying this coupling, we employ a lattice Monte Carlo model of ternary lipid mixtures that exhibit liquid disordered (Ld) and liquid ordered (Lo) phase coexistence. In this framework, proteins are represented as small membrane inclusions with tunable nearest neighbor interactions with both lipids and other proteins, allowing us to examine how protein lipid affinity competes with protein protein interactions and lipid lipid demixing. We find that the balance of these interactions controls whether proteins remain dispersed, assemble into small oligomers, or form large stable clusters within Lo domains, and that increasing the protein concentration further promotes coarsening of the ordered phase. To incorporate ligand regulated activation, we extend the model to a kinetic Monte Carlo scheme in which proteins stochastically switch between inactive and active states with distinct affinities. The inverse switching rate, relative to the time required for a protein to diffuse across the characteristic size of the Lo domains, governs the aggregation behavior. Rapid switching yields only transient small oligomers, slow switching reproduces the static limit with persistent large clusters, and intermediate rates produce broad cluster size distributions. These results highlight the interplay between lipid phase organization, protein lipid affinity, and activation dynamics in regulating membrane protein oligomerization, a coupling that is central to signal transduction and membrane organization in living cells.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Current biopsy-based IF assessments rely on subjective visual estimations, limiting reproducibility. Sirius Red staining is widely used for visualizing fibrotic tissue, yet its application in digital pathology is limited by non-specific staining. This study investigates the impact of cortical structure segmentation on fibrosis quantification in Sirius Red-stained, non-neoplastic kidney biopsies. Fibrosis measurements before and after segmentation were compared using two image analysis methods (stain deconvolution and red-green), with ground truth fibrosis measured by point counting and expert pathologist grading. Excluding non-interstitial structures led to a significant reduction of quantified fibrosis and improved correlation with pathology grading and point counting for both the stain deconvolution and the red green method. Bland-Altman analysis showed reduced bias after segmentation: for the deconvolution method, mean difference decreased from +2.5% (95% LoA: -8% to +13%) to +1% (-7% to +9%); for the red-green method, from +3% (-10% to +16%) to +1% (-8% to +10%). Correlation with pathology grading also improved (Spearmans {rho} rose from 0.55 to 0.58 for deconvolution and from 0.53 to 0.59 for red-green).

Consistent with imaging data, intensity-modulated optogenetic stimulation of pretectum induced progressively more lateralised contraversive orienting behaviour and spatially patterned stimulation of optic tectum revealed a motor map along the anterior-posterior axis that primarily generated ipsiversive responses. Anatomical tracing and laser axotomies indicated that pretectal neurons control contraversive turns via a crossed pretectobulbar pathway whereas optic tectum shows topographically patterned output with a major uncrossed projection to hindbrain.

To address this, we used a biophysically realistic network model to probe the effects of slow-wave sleep (SWS) on synaptic-weight space. We show that previously learned memories are stable attractors in that space, and that hippocampus-driven interactions between sharp-wave ripples and cortical slow waves push the system into new attractor states that jointly encode old and new memories. As a result, replay allows recently acquired information to be incorporated without degrading prior memories.

R.; van Putten, M. J. A. M.; Meijer, H. G. E.", "abstract": "Cerebral ischemia impairs neuronal and glial function, ranging from synaptic failure to irreversible damage. The effects of ischemia on excitatory synaptic transmission remain incompletely understood. Here, we present a detailed biophysical model including the first full implementation of the glutamate-glutamine cycle (GG-cycle), which is essential for proper functioning of glutamatergic synapses. We simulate a presynaptic neuron and an astrocyte in a finite extracellular space (ECS), surrounded by an oxygen bath, as a proxy for energy supply. The model includes ionic currents with corresponding channels and transporters such as the sodium-potassium ATPase. To model synaptic transmission, we combine calcium-dependent glutamate release, its uptake by the sodium-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), and the GG-cycle, including glutamine synthesis. We simulate ischemia by blocking energy supply completely. The neuron enters a depolarization block, ion concentrations reach pathological values, and glutamate accumulates in the ECS while glutamate release is disrupted. Surprisingly, we found that synaptic transmission failure was not primarily caused by excessive glutamate release nor by failure of glutamine synthetase. Instead, it mainly resulted from EAAT dysfunction, driven by the collapse of the sodium gradient. Enhancing glutamate clearance alone was insufficient for recovery of synaptic transmission. However, inhibition of the voltage-gated Na+ channels restored ion gradients, recovered glutamate uptake, and re-enabled glutamate release. Taken together, our study highlights the critical role of ion homeostasis, in particular the sodium gradient, in maintaining synaptic function during metabolic stress. Moreover, the model provides a better understanding of synaptic transmission failure and potential recovery strategies during ischemia.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

The 1 receptor agonist phenylephrine increased cAMP, but this effect was suppressed when Ca2+ elevations were blocked by Ca2+ depletion and removal of external Ca2+. We found that 1A and 1D receptors are key targets for phenylephrine, acting through Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclases AC1 and AC3 downstream of 1 receptor activation. Moreover, 2 receptor stimulation raised Ca2+ levels, thereby stimulating cAMP production, yet also reduced forskolin-induced cAMP elevations, indicating that 2 receptors can both inhibit adenylyl cyclase via Gi and stimulate AC1/AC3 via Ca2+ signaling.

In Experiment 1, we evaluated the consistency at both the group level and the individual level across four EEG systems: one research-grade wired system (BioSemi) and three mobile devices - Smarting, DSI-24, and EPOC X. At the group level, all systems demonstrated the canonical N100 and P300 components; however, the EPOC X system showed a significantly reduced signal-to-noise ratio compared to the others. At the individual level, temporal and spatial clustering analyses showed that N100 and P300 components were detectable in most individuals (70-85%), with additional significant responses appearing outside this range. We further calculated the similarity of individual responses across participants (typicality index), which revealed highly consistent responses to Standard and Novel sounds, alongside divergent patterns of responses to Targets. In Experiment 2, we assessed the within-participant reliability of N100 and P300 using a test-retest design. Results indicated high within-participant consistency of response patterns for all three stimuli, demonstrating that individual ERPs remain reliably stable over time, even when they deviate from canonical group-level patterns.

Prior research has established psychophysical thresholds and discrimination levels for vibrotactile stimuli, yet less is known about tactile intensity perception. Understanding the signaling of tactile intensity and how mechanical dynamics of skin transmission shape this is critical for providing effective graded haptic feedback. We investigated how modifying the frequency, amplitude, and waveform shape of vibration at the wrist influence free ratings of perceived tactile intensity. Two accelerometers recorded mechanical signals: one embedded within the vibrotactile wristband and another placed 1 cm away on the skin, enabling tracking of vibration propagation through the tissue. We found that perceived intensity was determined by all three parameters, but each had a distinct role. Vibration frequency exerted a non-linear influence, with perceived intensity peaking around 150 Hz, which also corresponded to the actuator's mechanical resonance, with lower secondary peaks for square and sawtooth waveforms in-line with vibratory harmonics. Moreover, square waves were consistently rated as most intense. Vibration amplitude provided a consistent scaling of perceived strength, which was strongly correlated with both actuator and skin acceleration, indicating that skin-transmitted accelerations retained the stimulation profile. We find that the skin acts as a non-linear, frequency-dependent mechanical filter that selectively modulates vibration transmission. Understanding these determinants provides insights for the design of wearable haptic devices and how these can be used to provide graded feedback during tactile interactions.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Broadband aperiodic activity needs to be separated from narrowband periodic activity before its parameters are computed. A popular method, the fooof toolbox (Donoghue et al., 2020), is based on the data-driven detection of narrowband-periodic peaks, whose maximum number is set by the user. While increasing analytic flexibility, variability in the number of detected peaks may increase sensitivity to noise and reduce the reliability of aperiodic parameter estimates and the power of analytic pipelines. Here, we present an investigation of the effects of several analytic choices (e.g., number of peaks, spectral estimation method) on metrics indicating the adequacy of spectral parametrization. These metrics include the internal consistency (odd-even reliability) of aperiodic estimates, the number of outliers generated, and their ability to detect effects. Across two different data sets (resting state and task-based) we found a decrease in the reliability of intercept and slope estimates as more peaks were allowed to be extracted. To ameliorate this problem, we propose a theory-driven modification of fooof labelled censored regression, whereby the same range of frequencies expected to contain periodic activity is removed from all spectra, and the remaining power values are regressed on the remaining frequencies to obtain parameter estimates. This method shows superior reliability and accuracy compared to fooof. Our findings thus provide suggestions for best practices for estimating 1/f parameters.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

We assayed the expression of key markers of head patterning and neurosecretory centres in mandibulates in the pre-cheliceral region of embryos of the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum.

It was found that zebrafish (Danio rerio) lens nuclei are initially anteriorly localized in optical axes in larvae, then centralize at older stages. An anteriorly placed lens nucleus would increase lens power, thereby likely enabling a functional optical system in larvae, where eye axial length is short. To assess if alike mechanisms occur in other aquatic animals, we studied the clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, a fully aquatic species similarly relying on vision for survival at stages where eyes are small. We found the Xenopus tadpole lens nucleus also shifted from an anterior to a central location in the optical axis during the prometamorphosis period. Similarly, in eyes regenerated after embryonic ablation, tadpole lens nuclei are anteriorly localized then centralize before metamorphosis, recapitulating the same pattern as control developing eyes. Moreover, lens nuclei localization in optical axes in developing and regenerated Xenopus eyes show close correlations to axial eye length. Close correlation of these two parameters suggests lens nuclei centralization is required for a functional optical system by coordinating the focal length. Our findings suggest a conserved evolutionary mechanism for eye optical development in at least two aquatic species.

France, with 983 species, hosts one of the most diverse bee faunas in Europe, yet these species face growing pressures from habitat loss, climate change, and intensive agriculture. Addressing this crisis requires robust taxonomic frameworks and efficient species identification methods to support long-term monitoring initiatives such as the European Pollinator Monitoring Scheme, EU-PoMS. DNA barcoding, utilizing the COI-5P gene, has proven effective for species delineation and biodiversity monitoring, particularly in detecting cryptic diversity among genera with large numbers of species such as Andrena, Nomada or Lasioglossum. However, significant gaps remain in reference libraries, particularly for the species from the Mediterranean Basin. To bridge this gap, the CODABEILLES initiative was launched in 2021 to enhance barcode data for the French bee fauna. Initially, only 25% of species had barcodes from French voucher specimens, increasing to 62% when considering voucher specimens from other countries. By 2025, thanks to collaboration with sixteen specialists and institutions, CODABEILLES contributed 1477 reference barcodes, covering approximately 560 species and raising barcode coverage to 82%. When integrating data published under other initiatives over the same period the coverage reaches 94% of the French bee fauna. This dataset significantly enhances species identification accuracy and supports large-scale pollinator monitoring through metabarcoding and environmental DNA approaches. Despite the success of COI-5P barcoding, taxonomic inconsistencies persist, necessitating further integrative research. This study underscores the need for continued collaboration among taxonomists, molecular biologists, and conservationists to refine species classifications and ensure comprehensive reference databases.

Through mass cytometry analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes, we collected high-dimensional data from de novo chronic phase CML patients enrolled in two multicenter clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01725204 and NCT01061177). In leukocytes, dasatinib and nilotinib inhibited intracellular signaling within one or three hours after first per oral dose, and each TKI had a unique signaling signature reflecting its kinase specificity profile beyond BCR::ABL1. An immune and signaling profile was constructed for each patient, predicting the treatment response (BCR::ABL1IS, %) the first 12 months of treatment.

In addition to classic host defense against parasites, food quality control through antigen avoidance has been recently elucidated as additional physiological mast cell function. The purine nucleoside adenosine (ADO), like other mast cell activators, such as antigens or Mrgprb2 agonists, increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration; however, it fails to induce degranulation of preformed mediators when applied to isolated mast cells alone, and there is limited knowledge of whether ADO evokes the de novo synthesis and release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines in tissue mast cells. An unbiased genome-wide analysis of gene expression triggered by various mast cell activators should enable identification of the gene program specifically activated by adenosine in mast cells and thereby reveal new components of the associated inflammatory responses. To this end, we performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in primary murine peritoneal mast cells (PMCs) as connective tissue mast cells. By comparing responses evoked by ADO stimulation with those of the Mrgprb2 compound 48/80 and antigens that activate Fc{epsilon}RI receptors, we identified 393 genes whose expression was uniquely regulated by ADO, including upregulation of genes encoding de novo synthesized mediators such as Tgfa and Il7. Transcription factor activity inference, protein classification, functional enrichment analysis, protein-protein interaction network, and topology analysis revealed that these genes play roles in phosphoinositide signaling, vesicle trafficking, glycolysis, mitochondrial activity, and cell cycle arrest. In summary, our work elucidates a distinct ADO-triggered response and identifies a set of proteins including de novo synthesized mediators whose functional relevance in adenosine-evoked mast cell activation and inflammatory reactions can be evaluated in future studies.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that myelinated axons are sensitive to mechanical perturbations from ultrasound, providing a mechanistic rationale for targeting white matter tracts with ultrasound neuromodulation.

In a within-subject study, 15 healthy adults received 5 Hz patterned TUS targeted at the left corticospinal tract at the level of the superior internal capsule. The homologous tract in the opposite hemisphere and the ipsilateral motor cortex were targeted as comparison conditions to confirm site specificity. Left corticospinal tract TUS increased corticomotor excitability and intracortical facilitation, whereas left motor cortex TUS reduced intracortical inhibition. Diffusion tractography showed the magnitude of TUS-induced plasticity scaled with individual differences in white matter microstructure (fractional anisotropy) and ultrasound orientation in relation to the tract. These findings provide causal evidence of white matter plasticity in the human corticospinal tract and establish TUS as a tool for non-invasive neuromodulation of white matter tracts in health and disorders of white matter.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

S.; Spitschan, M.", "abstract": "Introduction: Previous studies have reported diurnal variations in colour and brightness perception, suggesting modulation of visual processing by the circadian pacemaker. Visual processing of image features such as colour and brightness begins with photoreceptor activity in the retina. To clarify potential time-of-day effects, we examined whether photoreceptor activation-the earliest stage of visual processing-is modulated by circadian timing. Methods: We disentangled circadian and homeostatic influences on human visual performance using a 40-hour forced desynchrony protocol. Twelve participants (5 female; mean age 24.4 {+/-} 2.9 years, range 19-30) followed a 2:1 sleep-wake cycle (3.75 h each) under constant environmental conditions. Circadian phase was determined from 46 salivary melatonin samples collected per participant. During wake periods, participants repeatedly completed temporal contrast sensitivity tasks at 2 Hz and 8 Hz, assessing luminance (L+M+S) and chromatic (L-M, S) mechanisms. We tested for circadian modulation of visual performance by comparing multi-level cosinor and uninformative Bayesian models. Results: All participants showed robust melatonin rhythms (mean {tau} = 24.18 {+/-} 0.39 h). Bayesian inference provided decisive evidence against circadian variation in luminance or chromatic contrast sensitivity. Discussion: These findings challenge previous reports of circadian changes in visual sensitivity, indicating that earlier effects likely reflected uncontrolled homeostatic factors or mechanisms beyond cone-mediated vision. Significance: Through precise control of environmental and physiological factors, this study offers new insights into how biological timing interfaces with human visual processing.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

A.; Brozi, C.; Smirnakis, S.

Higher-order visual areas in mice are known to exhibit more distinct, segregated functional roles compared to the primary visual cortex (V1), and they maintain stimulus representations over extended time scales. However, the stability of the architecture of their functional connectivity across time and brain states remains less understood. In vivo mesoscopic two-photon calcium imaging was used to simultaneously record activity from thousands of neurons across V1 and the extra-striate anterolateral area (AL) in mice, during both visual stimulation (optical-flow/motion) and at resting state (i.e., absence of stimulus). We then applied the spike time-tiling (STTC) coefficient to estimate the pairwise correlations of the neuronal firing and form the functional connectivity at the cell resolution. We then comparatively analyzed the functional connections within area AL and V1 under both stimulus-driven and resting-state conditions. The functional connectivity within AL remains consistently more robust over time than in area V1. Moreover, the structure of the functional connectivity in AL exhibits a smaller change between these two conditions compared to V1, indicating that functional connectivity derived from spontaneous activity more faithfully reflects the functional network architecture elicited by visual stimulation in this higher-order area. Finally, during the resting state, AL activity and functional connectivity are less dependent on pupil size than those of V1, indicating that arousal exerts a weaker modulatory effect on AL compared to V1.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here we apply a symmetry-based analytical framework to previously published magnetic resonance data acquired from proton spin ensembles in the living human brain. By reanalyzing the zero-quantum (ZQ) signal within this framework, we isolate a non-compact SU(1,1) sector of the full SU(4) spin algebra and exclude all compact SU(2) exchange pathways. A calibrated signal-level witness links the measured ZQ amplitude to the off-diagonal density-matrix element, yielding a direct lower bound on concurrence. The observed signal exceeds the separability threshold, confirming bipartite entanglement within the SU(1,1) manifold. This non-compact symmetry defines a hyperbolic temporal geometry that can be interpreted holographically as a non-traversable wormhole connecting correlated spin sectors. Such an entangled bridge provides a natural physical analogue of working memory. Independent evidence shows that the same magnetic-resonance signal correlates with short-term memory performance, supporting this interpretation and suggesting that transient SU(1,1) entanglement in the brain's proton spin ensemble may underlie a functional holographic memory mechanism.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

A cyanobacterial FDH termed AetF that contains FDH and flavin reductase in the same polypeptide chain could become a useful tool enzyme as the need of including a reductase is omitted. Notably, AetF exploits a unique substrate-interaction network to consecutively brominate tryptophan (Trp) on C5 and then C7 to generate di-brominated Trp. In this study, structure-based engineering is used to eliminate the C7 halogenation capacity of AetF. The resulting variant AetF-AIF that contains three residue substitutions mainly catalyzes bromination or iodination on C5 of Trp. We also show that combining AetF-AIF in tandem with the wild type AetF enables the generation of heterogeneously halogenated Trp in a one-pot reaction. The final products, 5-Br-7-I-Trp or 5-I-7-Br-Trp depending on the addition order of halides, account for a high ratio in the reaction mixture without additional purification step.

We show that OCIAD2 is transiently upregulated during mesendoderm differentiation, in a TGF{beta}/Activin A-dependent manner. OCIAD2 depletion impairs mesendoderm induction and specification, resulting in an incomplete epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Through transcriptome analysis, immunoblotting and localization studies on OCIAD2-depleted (KO) or overexpressing (OV) human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), we identified OCIAD2 as a positive regulator of TGF{beta} signalling. Additionally, KO hESCs exhibited downregulated fatty acid oxidation (FAO) genes, indicating dysregulated lipid metabolism. Pharmacological restoration of FAO improved mesendoderm differentiation capacity in KO, suggesting a key role for OCIAD2 in coordinating metabolism and TGF-{beta} signalling.

A shift towards gram-negative bacteria in the microbiota of the GEJ additionally promotes inflammation and likely carcinogenesis. Enterobacteriaceae are enriched in advanced stages of GEAC development, and members of this family can produce colibactin, a genotoxin implicated in DNA damage and tumor progression. We aimed to validate these observations and investigate the effect of E. coli with or without colibactin production on GEAC-carcinogenesis. Methods: Bacteria were profiled in human biopsies with imaging and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Organoids of our L2-IL1B mouse model of GEAC were exposed to E. coli with colibactin (CoPEC) and without colibactin production (noCoPEC) via organoid microinjection. The phenotypic and transcriptomic changes in the organoids after the coculture with E. coli were evaluated via histology and single-cell RNA sequencing. Results: In human specimens, we observed an infiltration of bacteria in GEJ-tissue upon tumor formation and detected Enterobacteriaceae in one third of BE-patients. CoPEC-injected organoids exhibited high rates of proliferation and DNA damage, and an upregulation of cancer-associated genes and pathways. Furthermore, genes and pathways associated with immune activation, defense mechanisms, metabolic reprogramming, autophagy and differentiation were upregulated in CoPEC-injected organoids. Conclusion: In addition to the enrichment of Enterobacteriaceae in the GEJ-tissue of patients at late stages of GEAC, we show that the exposure of colibactin-producing E. coli to murine BE-organoids promotes genetic instability and proliferation, and the activation of cancer-associated pathways, while also activating autophagy and enhancing intercellular homeostasis. This indicates that colibactin-producing E. coli have a dual effect on early stages of GEAC-carcinogenesis.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

While cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tracer access to skull bone marrow has been described in CSF circulation disorders, evidence on regional patterns and clinical correlates in broader clinical cohorts is limited. Methods: Three-dimensional imaging was performed at baseline, 4.5, 15, and 39 hours post-gadolinium administration in 87 patients with neurological conditions. Signal changes in skull bone marrow near the superior sagittal sinus, lateral fissure, and cisterna magna were recorded. CSF drainage function was characterized as the percentage changes in the signal unit ratio within the skull bone marrow from baseline to time points post administration of gadolinium. Results: The tracer drained from CSF into the skull bone marrow, highlighting the drainage variations nearby different regions. Reduced drainage was associated with female sex, hypertension, diabetes, and elevated neutrophil levels (p < 0.05). Drainage near the superior sagittal sinus was inversely associated with sleep quality and positively associated with cognitive scores, and partially accounted for the association of sleep quality with cognitive function (indirect effect {Delta}{beta} = -0.092; bootstrap 95% CI -0.195 to -0.004; proportion mediated {approx} 38%). Conclusion: These results support the presence of skull bone marrow adjacent routes for CSF tracer movement and suggest that skull bone marrow tracer dynamics relate to systemic inflammation, sleep quality, and cognitive performance in this clinical cohort.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Previous work has shown that canonical neural networks that minimize shared Helmholtz energy are cast as performing active inference of the external environment. However, how animals flexibly adapt to newly encountered environments remains to be fully addressed. To investigate the brain's generalizability and adaptability to new environments, this work develops canonical neural networks that employ multiple policy matrices in parallel. We demonstrate that the proposed model can recapitulate the prism adaptation--a form of visuomotor adaptation--under an arm-reaching task. Using policy matrices pretrained under various target positions, these networks could transfer previous experiences and exhibit faster adaptation to the prism-shifted environment than the naive networks. Furthermore, after-effects were observed following the removal of simulated prism glasses. These results suggest the biological plausibility and utility of the proposed model, providing insights into the adaptive capabilities of the brain.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

K.; Chivukula, U.; Garbusow, M.; Kumar, N.", "abstract": "Alcohol cues can influence ongoing instrumental behavior through Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT), possibly promoting problematic alcohol consumption. This influence can be explained by automatic approach tendencies towards alcohol, which play a role in understanding alcohol abuse and relapse. However, individuals differ in these tendencies; some exhibit a strong approach, while others exhibit avoidance; yet, how such profiles shape PIT and intervention outcomes remains unclear. Existing interventions predominantly target approach tendencies, often overlooking avoidance profiles that may represent distinct motivational control. Building on evidence that cue-evoked responding reflects learned expectancies about response effectiveness, we investigated whether counterconditioning (CC), i.e., reversing alcohol cue valence by pairing it with an aversive outcome, could reduce approach tendencies and attenuate alcohol-related PIT effects across both approach and avoidance groups. To enhance interventional effect transfer, we integrated retrieval cues to facilitate memory reactivation in non-treatment contexts. Thirty-nine alcohol users completed the Alcohol Approach-Avoidance Task (A-AAT) and PIT task before and after CC, with participants categorized by their baseline Alcohol Approach Index. EEG recorded neural responses, focusing on N2 and P3 ERPs as indices of conflict monitoring and cognitive control. Individuals with approach tendencies showed stronger PIT interference during avoidance-related actions in the presence of alcohol cues. CC attenuated these tendencies and restored instrumental responding, with retrieval cues supporting transfer effects. Post-intervention, enhanced frontal N2 and centro-parietal P3 amplitudes reflected improved conflict monitoring and top-down control. These findings demonstrate that retrieval cue-integrated CC can recalibrate automatic approach tendencies and restore adaptive instrumental behavior, with corresponding neural enhancements, offering a practical intervention to reduce cue-driven drinking.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Using an adaptive consciousness measurement framework applied to 622 sleep stage transitions across 12 subjects from the Sleep-EDF database, we demonstrate that both theories are correct within distinct transition types. Our Consciousness Gradient Index (CGI) framework reveals that three of four transition types (75%: Wake[-&gt;]N1, N2[-&gt;]N3, REM[-&gt;]Wake) follow gradual dynamics consistent with IIT predictions (mean slopes: -0.736, -0.532, +0.614), while one transition type (25%: N1[-&gt;]N2) exhibits threshold behavior via thalamic spindle gating mechanisms (mean slope: -2.188).

A.; Chourdaki, I.; Smirnakis, S.

Our work contributes to the problem of decoupling the stimulus-driven and internally generated components of neural activity in the primary visual cortex. Internally generated (or intrinsic) activity refers to neural dynamics that are not directly driven by sensory stimuli, reflecting the brain's ongoing, endogenous processes. Neuronal activity encodes both external stimuli and internal cortical states. The internally modulated activity, though not directly observable, can be inferred from the shared structure in population responses, and thus, serves as a proxy for the internal cortical state. We developed a two-phase Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) framework that decomposes neural activity into two orthogonal low-dimensional subspaces: (1) a \"population\" subspace capturing global variability shared across neurons, and (2) a \"stimulus\" subspace containing dimensions that discriminate between stimulus conditions while being linearly uncorrelated with the population subspace. We focus on the granular (L4) and supragranular (L2/3) layers of awake mice exposed to visual stimuli consisting of optical flow directions, using mesoscopic two-photon calcium imaging. In both L4 and L2/3 layers, many components individually yield above-chance decoding accuracy, yet a small low-dimensional subspace preserves nearly the full decoding performance of the high-dimensional population. Stimulus-driven components exhibit strong cross-mouse correlations, indicating a conserved coding scheme present in both L4 and L2/3. These components are stable across the entire recording session, reflecting robustness of the underlying representation over time. Removing the global modulation did not abolish stimulus discriminability in either layer, suggesting that information about stimulus direction is not dependent on this global signal. Both L4 and L2/3 stimulus components exhibit comparable decoding performance as well as similar tuning representations, suggesting common encoding of stimulus direction across layers.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Traditional management strategies often rely on sett (burrow) locations to infer badger distribution, which implicitly assumes a correlation with abundance. This study uses data from Ireland's national badger culling and vaccination programme (2019 - 2025) to decouple badger and sett distributions using spatial point process modelling via log-Gaussian Cox processes. By separately modelling the environmental drivers of main sett and badger distributions, and validating outputs for ecological realism with independent badger body weight data, we demonstrate that sett and badger densities are governed by distinct ecological processes. Sett densities are driven by landscape features such as elevation, slope, and proximity to forest edges, while badger densities are more influenced by recent culling history and pasture availability. Our results reveal a spatial mismatch between high-density sett areas and high-density badger areas, highlighting the need for refined metrics in wildlife-based bTB management.

Although phage cocktails can delay resistance, their efficacy relies on the ability to target the full spectrum of resistant variants, which are often more diverse than that represented by clonal isolates. In this study, we investigated how phenotypic diversity within phage-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae influences susceptibility to newly isolated phages and the effectiveness of phage cocktails. We isolated phages from three cultures resistant to a capsule-dependent phage: a heterogeneous acapsular population, an acapsular mutant with a stable phenotype, and a capsule-reverted isolate that regained capsule expression upon removal of phage pressure. These phages differed in host tropism and in their capacity to delay resistance emergence when combined with the capsule-dependent phage. Phages targeting acapsular variants, particularly those isolated from the heterogeneous population, were the most effective, exhibiting strong synergy. Single-cell analyses further revealed that sustained selective pressure from the capsule-dependent phage prevents capsule reversion and maintains cocktail efficacy. Overall, our results highlight the importance of accounting for phenotypic heterogeneity when designing phage therapies and support population-level approaches for optimizing phage cocktail composition.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here we sought to determine the systemic effects, and mechanism of action, of microbiome-derived carnitine analogues in germ free and conventionally colonised mice. Results: Here we report the systemic localization of the microbiome-derived carnitine analogues, 3-methyl-4-(trimethylammonio)butanoate (3M-4-TMAB) and 5-aminovalerate betaine (5-AVAB), post-administration to germ free mice, with systemic carnitine depletion and mitochondrial dysregulation, reflected in altered acylcarnitine profiles due to incomplete carnitine-mediated fatty acid oxidation. Studies on the inhibitory potency of 3M-4-TMAB at the enzymatic, cellular, and organism levels indicate that, in part, this is a result of inhibition of gammabutyrobetaine hydroxylase, which catalyses the final step in carnitine biosynthesis. Systemic administration of 13C-labelled 3M-4-TMAB to conventionally colonised animals to further investigate the physiological relevance of this inhibition, identified a significant reduction in systemic carnitine levels due to increased excretion in urine and faeces and disruption of carnitine-mediated metabolism across ten organs. Conclusions: These results highlight the physiological relevance and significance of microbiome-derived metabolites in vivo.

However, in environments like soil, where microbial populations are spatially fragmented, sparse, nutrient-limited, and subject to mass transport, the mechanisms that enable QS-dependent processes remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigate the regulation of a secreted redox-active metabolite, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), in Pseudomonas synxantha 2-79, a model rhizobacterium, under phosphorus (P) limitation, a persistent stress in many soils. Using a combination of microscopy and molecular genetic approaches, we show that P limitation sensitizes the QS activation threshold by an order of magnitude, enabling phenazine induction at relatively low population densities in comparison to P replete conditions. This induction is abolished in QS-deficient mutants and restored by the addition of exogenous acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), demonstrating that quorum sensing remains essential but its threshold becomes environmentally tuned. Under P limitation, spatial confinement and pore saturation levels further shape the timing and location of induction, illustrating how physical structure and nutrient stress can modulate bacterial activities. Moreover, phosphorus stress confers both collaborative and competitive advantages, enabling P. synxantha to undergo low-cell density AHL cross-talk between related Pseudomonas spp. and to suppress other rhizobacteria. Lastly, on plant roots, PCA genes were more predominantly induced under P limitation. These findings illustrate how the nutrient status of an environment can modulate the onset of quorum sensing, enabling quorum-regulated behaviors to activate at lower thresholds.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

However, we know less about how the Ciona embryo precisely regulates cell numbers, as well as what effects altering cell numbers will have on development. We found that cell numbers in the B7.5 lineage are controlled by a pulse of transcription of the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1.b. Cdkn1.b can be repressed by the paralogues Prdm1-r.a and Prdm1-r.b that are exclusively transcribed in the B7.5 cells at the 110-cell stage.

MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase classically viewed as an oncogene, has also been proposed to act as a dependence receptor through its caspase-mediated cleavage, but whether this property impacts tumorigenesis remained unknown. In ~3% of lung adenocarcinomas, MET mutations leading to exon 14 skipping (METex14Del) remove both the caspase site and the adjacent CBL-binding motif, thereby preventing generation of the pro-apoptotic p40MET fragment. METex14Del promotes sustained signaling, enhanced invasion, apoptosis resistance, and tumor growth in HGF-humanized mice. Genome editing revealed that combined, but not individual, mutations of the caspase and CBL sites phenocopy METex14Del. Moreover, inducible re-expression of p40MET in METex14Del-expressing cells restored apoptosis and suppressed tumor formation.

To address this, we previously created a high-strength, neutral pH buffered version (hs PAbW) that is better suited for clinical use in humans. This neutral plasma activated water retained the potent antimicrobial activity. In this study, we engineered a hydrogel containing hs-PAbW at a bactericidal yet non-cytotoxic dose (hs PAbW 20) and assessed its efficacy in murine wound models. In Balb/c mice, hs PAbW 20 gel significantly reduced Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus burden, achieving results comparable to neomycin and soframycin treatments. This gel also accelerated wound closure by modulating genes crucial for wound repair. In diabetic C57BL/6 mouse model, hs PAbW 20 gel decreased the burden of P. aeruginosa and promoted faster healing. Together, these findings establish hs PAbW 20 gel as a promising next generation therapeutic with the potential to overcome limitations of conventional antibiotic-based wound care.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Current surveillance strategies focus on targeted approaches which are well suited for monitoring established threats but limited in their ability to detect recently described or neglected viruses. High throughput sequencing (HTS) provides an unbiased alternative, allowing simultaneous identification of well-recognised and overlooked arboviruses, alongside insect-specific viruses (ISVs) that may modulate vector competence of the insects transmitting these pathogens. This study presents the first comprehensive virome survey of Culex mosquitoes in the UK, analysing populations collected from 93 sites across England and Wales through HTS and a systematic virus discovery pipeline. Across these sites, 41 distinct viral taxa were identified, including 11 novel species. Most viruses were rare or confined to a few sites, with only three detected in more than one third of sites, suggesting the absence of a broad conserved virome across populations. Within this diversity, three arbovirus-related lineages were detected: Hedwig virus (Peribunyaviridae), Umatilla virus (Sedoreoviridae), and Atherstone virus (Peribunyaviridae), the former two representing the first detections in the UK. These putative arboviruses were embedded in viral communities that showed minimal structuring by coarse land type but a modest decline in richness with latitude across rural sites, consistent with diversity gradients observed in other microbial systems. Together, these findings provide the first national-scale baseline of Culex mosquito-associated viral diversity in the UK, and demonstrate the value of metagenomic approaches in arbovirus preparedness.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

TnaA is known to convert tryptophan into indole, a known signalling molecule, but other routes remain obscure. Here, we show that nanoplasmonic surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) enables label-free detection of indole in Escherichia coli with a limit of detection of 100 nM - over 500-fold more sensitive than previously reported and significantly outperforming existing colorimetric assays. Using this ultrasensitive approach, we perform SERS on wild-type and tnaA knockout E. coli strains and discover a distinct TnaA-dependent metabolic signature in both standard and uropathogenic strains when cultures are supplemented with amino acids other than tryptophan. Quantitative spectral analysis reveals an indole-like metabolite whose Raman signature does not correspond to free indole or any known indole derivative characterised by mass spectrometry. This observation implies previously unidentified bacterial metabolic pathways involving amino acid reallocation which can depend on environmental conditions. Given the central role of TnaA in bacterial signalling and virulence, these findings raise new hypotheses regarding the biological role of indole derivatives and TnaA-mediated byproducts. More broadly, our results establish nanoplasmonic SERS as a powerful technique for probing enzyme activity and bioactive metabolite production in vivo at concentrations well below the detection limits of existing methods.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Enterococci, particularly E. faecalis, can survive in diverse settings within and outside human hosts. The capacity of E. faecalis to colonize these locations relies on its ability to adapt by altering gene expression in response to environmental exposures. One mechanism for quickly altering gene expression is through regulation by small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs); sRNAs can regulate one or many target genes and either up- or down-regulate transcript stability and protein expression. While many sRNAs have been predicted in E. faecalis, few have experimentally established target mRNAs or physiological functions. Here, we investigate the targets, function, and mechanism of Enterococcus sRNA 84. We found that sRNA 84 is conserved within the family Enterococcaceae, suggesting that it plays a role in the regulation of core genes and functions. RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis revealed that the absence of sRNA 84 led to downregulation of many cell surface proteins, including mucin-binding proteins. Consistent with these findings, an sRNA 84 knockout strain had reduced binding to mucin in vitro and impaired intestinal colonization of specific-pathogen-free mice. Taken together, these data support a model whereby sRNA 84 upregulates cell surface adhesins, which subsequently facilitate host colonization through binding to mucin. sRNA 84 is one of the first sRNAs in enterococci with demonstrated targets and function. This finding establishes the conserved sRNA 84 as a potential key regulator of enterococcal host adaptation, providing insight into how these organisms adapt their gene expression to survive both within and outside animal hosts.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

L.; Hullahalli, K.", "abstract": "Bacterial dissemination across tissues is a critically important process influencing infection outcomes. Monitoring within-host dissemination is challenging because conventional measures of bulk bacterial burden cannot distinguish between lineages that are shared between tissues and those that replicate locally. This limitation can be overcome using barcoded bacteria, where deep sequencing of the barcode locus and comparisons of barcodes between tissues define which lineages spread within the host. Numerous studies have used barcoded bacteria to generate high-resolution maps of dissemination. However, since multiple cells in the infectious inoculum can contain identical barcodes, inferences about dissemination can be confounded when distinct lineages from the inoculum with identical barcodes are observed in different tissues. Thus, even though the same barcodes can be observed in different tissues, dissemination between these tissues may not have occurred. Here, we aimed to develop an approach that would provide a solution to this confounding effect. We developed a simulation-based distance metric that quantifies the significance of observing shared barcodes between tissues. We validated this approach using simulated datasets spanning three orders of magnitude in barcode diversities and on three published experimental infection datasets. Our reanalysis reveals previously unappreciated patterns of Escherichia coli spread during liver abscess formation, clarifies the role of the Muc2 mucin in Listeria monocytogenes systemic spread, and quantifies how Klebsiella pneumoniae replication in the lungs drives systemic dissemination.

We developed pGGTOX, a modular plasmid platform that enables efficient homologous recombination-mediated genome editing across diverse Enterobacteriaceae, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and Enterobacter intestinihominis. The system integrates a rhamnose-inducible toxin (MqsR) for stringent counterselection, a sfGFP reporter for visual tracking of recombination events, Golden Gate cloning for rapid assembly of homologous arms, an FRT-flanked resistance cassette for marker removal, and an oriT sequence for conjugative transfer. Together with the companion plasmid pCP20-oriT, pGGTOX supports precise, marker-free genomic modification. Using pGGTOX, we achieved targeted deletions of dapA in E. coli and mrkCD in carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, both with 100% efficiency. The dapA mutant exhibited diaminopimelate auxotrophy, while mrkCD deletion markedly reduced biofilm formation, consistent with the loss of function associated with these genes. pGGTOX also enabled deletion of a 43.1-kb type IV secretion gene cluster (tra) from an IncN/FII plasmid in E. intestinihominis and insertion of a 10-kb CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid-curing module (pCasCure) into an S. enterica IncX1 plasmid. Deletion of the tra gene cluster resulted in a substantial reduction in plasmid conjugation efficiency. Conjugative transfer of the engineered IncX1-pCasCure plasmid into K. pneumoniae facilitated CRISPR-mediated curing of blaKPC, sensitizing carbapenem resistance to susceptibility.

The transcriptional activity of cccDNA depends on its chromatin organization, yet the contribution of histone variants to this regulation remains poorly understood. Methods: Using mass spectrometry based proteomics on native cccDNA purified from infected primary human hepatocytes, we identified the histone variant H2A.Z and its chaperone SRCAP as cccDNA-associated proteins. Functional analyses combining shRNA-mediated silencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and ATAC-seq were performed in HBV-infected HepG2-NTCP cells and primary human hepatocytes to characterize their roles in cccDNA formation and transcription. Results: Depletion of H2A.Z.1, H2A.Z.2, or SRCAP reduced both HBV RNA levels and cccDNA formation. H2A.Z recruitment to cccDNA correlated with the establishment of active chromatin marks (H3K4me3) and enhanced RNA polymerase II loading, promoting an open and transcriptionally active chromatin state. In addition, we identified BRD2, an H2A.Z-associated transcriptional co-activator, as a positive regulator of HBV transcription. shRNA mediated depletion and pharmacological degradation of BRD2 using the PROTAC ARV-771 reduced HBV RNA levels, supporting its potential as an antiviral target. Conclusion: Our findings uncover a critical role of the H2A.Z variant and SRCAP complex in cccDNA formation and transcriptional activation. By facilitating chromatin accessibility and RNA polymerase II recruitment, H2A.Z establishes an epigenetic environment favorable to HBV persistence. Targeting H2A.Z-associated co-activators such as BRD2 may represent a promising strategy to silence cccDNA transcription and achieve functional HBV cure.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

R. chloraquaticus comprises of two sub-species groups, Lineages 1 and 2, the former representing a globally prevalent genomovar. The objective of this study was to perform comparative analysis of the gene content of R. chloraquaticus to characterize the gene-level diversity and determine factors shaping the diversity of this species. Pangenome analysis revealed that R. chloraquaticus possesses a core set of genes that constitute a major portion (87.74%) of the known gene content of the genome. Furthermore, most of the gene diversity of R. chloraquaticus is associated with Lineage 2 organisms, which consists of at least four distinct genomovars. Lineage 1 organisms consist of a higher proportion of identical genes than would have been expected if changes primarily occurred through random mutations and thus is potentially indicative of recombination. In contrast, Lineage 2 organisms appear to have emerged through random mutations and display stronger geographic preference. These results indicate that homologous recombination and geographic isolation likely shape the genetic repertoire of R. chloraquaticus. Further, the high level of gene conservation in R. chloraquaticus may be reflective of highly selective environment in drinking water systems. Thus, R. chloraquaticus may represent a model organism to probe selective pressures shaping the drinking water microbiome.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Synthesis of mPEG-PCL diblock copolymers was confirmed through FTIR and 1H NMR, which validated the formation of ester functional groups and accurate structure of copolymers. mPEG-PCL MNPs, loaded with ribavirin, exhibited a mean diameter of approximately 34.29 {+/-} 5.214 nm and a zeta potential of -3.28 {+/-} 0.718 mV, suitable for evading immune detection and facilitating cellular entry. The ribavirin-loaded mPEG-PCL MNPs demonstrated pH-dependent release, with approximately 88% of ribavirin released at pH 5.5, compared to 20% at pH 7.4. This pH-responsive release is crucial for targeted drug delivery within the endosomal pathway. In vitro studies using JEG-3 cells infected with Zika virus showed that ribavirin-loaded mPEG-PCL MNPs achieved an EC50 of 0.22nM, significantly enhancing drug efficacy compared to unencapsulated ribavirin, which required micromolar concentrations to achieve similar effects. The MTT assay results indicated minimal cytotoxicity of the ribavirin-loaded mPEG-PCL MNPs, with approximately 80% cell viability at the highest concentration evaluated.

We studied the chromatin interactome of NESPR lncRNA in cells with varying levels of endogenous expression, and then performed a meta-analysis using dozens of RNA-chromatin interaction datasets in human and mouse cells. We show that thousands of regions reported to bind lncRNAs most likely arise from spurious recovery of DNA elements with partial complementarity of the ends of the recovered DNA fragments with the probes used for the pulldown. In addition, crucial controls were rarely used in studies profiling RNA-chromatin interactions.

It has been recently demonstrated that the effect of FSI is important in molecular evolution especially when the effective population size (Ne) is not small. Intriguingly, a novel pattern of molecular evolution called selection duality, i.e., mutations that are statistically slightly beneficial are subject to a negative selection, emerges under the condition that selective advantage is less than FSI. While FSI sheds some lights on the long-term neutralist-selectionist debate, an immediate question is how to calculate the strength of FSI-genetic drift relative to the Ne-genetic drift. In this article we develop a statistical method the relative FSI strength (F): if F is close to 0, the Ne-genetic drift is dominant; whereas the FSI-genetic drift is dominant if F is close to 1. One may tentatively set F=0.5 as an empirical criterion to weigh between those two genetic drifts. Our case study showed that the relative FSI-strength F is over 0.5 in most species, suggesting that the FSI-genetic drift, rather than the Ne-drift, plays a major role in metazoan genome evolution.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "PfNCR1 is a Plasmodium falciparum cholesterol transporter at the plasma membrane-parasitophorous vacuole interface, which has recently emerged as a promising antimalarial target. Despite an immense interest in development of novel antimalarials targeting PfNCR1, the molecular mechanism of PfNCR1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we report cryo-EM structures of PfNCR1 in its apo state and bound to three inhibitors: MMV009108, MMV019662 and MMV028038. MMV009108 binds to the \"neck\" site at the ectodomain-membrane domain interface. MMV028038 displaces the sterol at the ectodomain \"ecto\" site. Remarkably, MMV019662 binds both sites: it associates near the bound sterol molecule at the ecto site and targets the neck site, thereby altering the sterol-sensing domain conformation. Moreover, we identify a novel antimalarial compound, G856-4236, which targets the ecto site exclusively. These four distinct modes of PfNCR1 inhibition advance our understanding of its conformational plasticity and establish a framework for rational drug discovery targeting PfNCR1 and related transporters.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Despite longstanding biochemical knowledge, the structural mechanisms governing its allosteric regulation and domain coordination remain poorly defined. Here, we present the cryo-EM structures of Mycobacterium tuberculosis PC (MtPC) captured in both apo and substrate-bound forms. In the absence of acetyl-CoA, MtPC forms a flexible and unstable tetramer that readily dissociates into subcomplexes. Upon binding of acetyl-CoA and the substrates, the enzyme transitions into a compact, ordered assembly, with acetyl-CoA acting as a molecular clamp that stabilizes inter-subunit interactions. Remarkably, we captured the mobile biotinylated domain simultaneously engaging each catalytic center within monomers, providing direct structural evidence for the two steps of the catalytic cycle. 3D variability analysis further revealed how this mobile domain translocates between the active sites during catalysis. Together, these findings demonstrate how acetyl-CoA stabilizes MtPC by reinforcing inter-subunit contacts and elucidate the conformational dynamics underlying domain coordination during catalysis. These findings provide new structural insights into the allosteric regulation of this essential metabolic enzyme.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to identify biological parts involved in microbial salt stress responses for applications in microbial engineering. Regulatory regions adjacent to genes related to salinity and other industrially relevant conditions in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 were cloned into a reporter plasmid for functional evaluation. We identified and characterized the promoters of PP_1833 and PP_4707 as salt-inducible in KT2440, showing fluorescence levels 1.9- and 2.8-fold greater than a standard strong constitutive promoter (Pj100) under 3.5% NaCl (w/v), respectively, while no activity was detected in Escherichia coli DH10B. These results provide a basis for developing salt-responsive regulatory circuits in P. putida KT2440.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Here, we contextualize plasmid crosstalk in genetic circuits by examining its impact on the design and performance of multiple, diverse transcription factor biosensors. Guided by a deeper understanding, we harness crosstalk to enhance cell-free biosensor performance. Together, these findings demonstrate that plasmid crosstalk can serve as a tunable property in the development of cell-free genetic circuits.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Metagenomic evidence suggests capacities for amino acid fermentation, cellulose degradation, and production of carbohydrate-active enzymes, with particular interest in their presumed role in syntrophic propionate oxidation (SPO), a key bottleneck in AD. However, a complete methylmalonyl-CoA (mmc) pathway, central to SPO, has not been previously identified in Cloacimonadota genomes. Here, we report results from a lab-scale anaerobic baffled reactor fed with sugar beet pulp, where a sharp increase in an uncultured Cloacimonadota OTU coincided with recovery of methanogenesis and enhanced methane production. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses enabled metabolic reconstruction of this OTU, complemented by a curated database of 47 genome-resolved Cloacimonadota species. Comparative genomics revealed conserved protein clusters indicative of an alternative mmc pathway, suggesting that this variant of the SPO pathway is a widespread, phylum-specific trait potentially linked to protein degradation and poly-{gamma}-glutamate biosynthesis. Network analysis identified the methanogenic archaeon Methanothrix as a primary syntrophic partner, an interaction further supported by propionate-fed enrichment cultures showing co-occurrence of Cloacimonadota and Methanothrix species. Our study sheds light on the Cloacimonadota metabolism, advancing our understanding of their ecological roles and potential for biotechnological applications.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}

Based on its reportedly broad host range, a zoonotic potential of RusV cannot be excluded. Apparently healthy yellow-necked field mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) were identified as potential reservoir hosts. In this study, we experimentally inoculated wood mice and Lewis rats with brain homogenates of RusV-infected animals. Intracranial as well as combined intranasal/peroral inoculation resulted in apparently persistent RusV infection in both rodent species, while combined intramuscular/subcutaneous injection failed to establish detectable infection. Viral loads were highest in the central nervous system, but viral RNA was prominently found also in mucosal organs of wood mice. Viral RNA was frequently detected in oral swabs from infected wood mice, but only sparsely from rats. Neither wood mice nor rats presented neurological signs during twelve weeks after infection. However, RusV-infected rats showed significantly reduced body weight. A lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis was observed in infected rats, whereas infected wood mice infrequently developed minimal lesions in the brain. Our study provides the first infection model for RusV and indicates that natural infection may occur via mucosal routes. Shedding of viral RNA suggests wood mice to serve as natural reservoir hosts. In rats, we could reproduce a lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis, as described for diseased cats and other tentative non-reservoir hosts.", "date": "2025-11-11", "journal": ""}
