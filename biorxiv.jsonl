S.; Weber, B.; Hurlemann, R.; Schultz, J. W.", "abstract": "This study investigated the neural mechanisms involved in feelings of interpersonal guilt and responsibility evoked by social decisions. In two studies (one during fMRI), participants repeatedly chose between safe and risky monetary outcomes in social contexts. Across conditions, each participant chose for both themselves and a partner (Social condition), or the partner chose for both themselves and the participant (Partner condition), or the participant chose just for themselves (Solo condition, control). If the risky option was chosen in the Social or Partner condition, participant and partner could each receive either the high or the low outcome of a lottery with 50% probability, independently of each other. Participants were shown the outcomes for themselves and for their partner on each trial, and reported their momentary happiness every few trials. As expected, participant happiness decreased following both low lottery outcomes for themselves and for the partner. Crucially, happiness decreases following low outcomes for the partner were larger when the participant rather than their partner had made the choice, which fits an operational definition of guilt. This guilt effect was associated with BOLD signal increase in the left anterior insula. Connectivity between this region and the right inferior frontal gyrus varied depending on choice and experimental condition, suggesting that this part of prefrontal cortex is sensitive to guilt-related information during social choices. Variations in happiness were well explained by computational models based on participant's and partner's rewards and reward prediction errors. A model-based analysis revealed a left superior temporal sulcus cluster that tracked partner reward prediction errors that followed participant choices. Our findings identify neural mechanisms of guilt and social responsibility during social decisions under risk.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Mass spectrometry identified Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) 3, the brain-specific isoform, as HLY72's target. Only blood-brain barrier-permeable NKA inhibitors reproduce HLY72's anti-obesity effects, and resistance to HLY72 treatment occurs specifically in NKA & [alpha]3 (not & [alpha]1) knockin mice harboring a HLY72-binding mutation. Similar to the chemical inhibition by HLY72, genetic inhibition of NKA & [alpha]3 also effectively protects mice from diet-induced obesity.

Despite good evidence for the existence of these laws in non-human primates, data is still limited for other taxa. Birdsong is often used as a model for human language development due to similarities in vocal learning and production. Therefore, it is useful to explore features of human language in birdsong to determine the value and limitations of such comparisons. Here, we looked for patterns consistent with Menzerath's law, the tendency for longer sequences to be made up of smaller constituent parts, and Zipf's Law of Abbreviation, the tendency for more frequently used elements to be shorter in length, in the songs of Java sparrows (Padda oryzivora). We found that songs conformed to Menzerath's law at both the population and individual level; longer sequences were made up of shorter notes, and this pattern was achieved through note selection, rather than shortening existing notes. This adherence to Menzerath's law may reflect species-specific constraints on song durations. However, we found no evidence to support adherence to Zipf's Law of Abbreviation, either at population or individual level; more frequently used notes were not shorter in length. As they are used in courtship, songs may experience different selection pressure to other parts of the vocal repertoire, which could act against compression. Whilst there may be some limitations in applying linguistic laws designed for human language to birdsong, especially Zipf's Law of Abbreviation, these laws may still provide insights into animal and human communication systems.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Quantifying >200,000 energetic interactions between the PDZ domain and its ligand identifies 17 residues that control specificity for six sites in the ligand through both direct and allosteric mechanisms. Most sites where specificity can be controlled through the domain are in the structured part of the ligand, but dynamic residues additively contribute to binding affinity and communicate with structured ligand residues to enable specificity changes. Combining mutations in each of the six PDZ domain modules allows specificity to be quantitatively reprogrammed to recognize new ligands. This approach of quantifying the specificities of thousands of proteins in a single experiment should allow many different types of molecular interaction to be understood and interpretably reprogrammed.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Although Drosophila serves as a powerful model for studying human metabolic diseases, modeling tissue-specific metabolism has been limited in this organism.

We validate enriched pathways identified through tissue-specific GEMs, particularly in muscle and fat body, using metabolomics and pathway analysis. Moreover, to demonstrate the utility in disease modeling, we apply muscle-GEM to investigate high sugar diet (HSD)-induced metabolic dysregulation. Constraint-based semi-quantitative flux and sensitivity analyses identify altered NAD(H)-dependent reactions and distributed control of glycolytic flux, including GAPDH. This prediction is further validated through in vivo 13C-glucose isotope tracing study. Notably, decreased glycolytic flux, including GAPDH, is linked to increased redox modifications. Finally, our pathway-level flux analyses identify dysregulation in fructose metabolism. Together, this work establishes a quantitative framework for tissue-specific metabolic modeling in Drosophila, demonstrating its utility for identifying dysregulated reactions and pathways in muscle in response to HSD.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Here in this study, using a combination of Dictyostelium amoeba, multiple mammalian leukocytes, and human cancer cells and 3D organoid systems, we monitored the localization dynamics of RasGTP and PIP5K, dissected the effects of eliminating, conditionally increasing, or optogenetically manipulating membrane PIP5K levels, screened for key regulators of Ras activation, and tracked single-molecules of PIP5K. Our data converge on a core biochemical circuit involving mutually inhibitory interactions between PIP5K and RasGTP that is both necessary and sufficient for symmetry breaking. The process is initiated by stochastic, localized Ras activation coupled with a decrease in the lifetime of the association of PIP5K with the membrane. A resulting localized reduction in PI(4,5)P2 facilitates the recruitment of a RasGEF to the corresponding domain, amplifying RasGTP production through a positive feedback loop. Dissociated PIP5K relocates to other membrane regions, where it suppresses Ras activation. These events separate the membrane into distinct active and inactive zones, even when receptor inputs or cytoskeletal activities are absent. This same core biochemical circuit controls the spatial organization of downstream PI3K/Akt/Rac signaling and actin/actomyosin activities, which generate the localized protrusions to define polarity and migration mode. While many models have been forwarded to explain polarity or symmetry breaking, the PIP5K-Ras mutually inhibitory bistable circuit we present here is the first universal molecular mechanism to explain the initiation of asymmetry as well as subsequent polarity and migration.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

A.; Robertson, C. E.", "abstract": "The human brain seamlessly integrates internally generated thoughts with incoming sensory information, yet the large-scale networks that support these functions -- the (Default Network, DN) and external (Dorsal Attention Network, dATN) -- are traditionally viewed as functionally antagonistic. This raises a crucial question: how does the brain integrate information across these seemingly opposed systems? Here, using densely sampled 7T fMRI, individualized resting-state parcellations, and voxel-wise population-receptive-field mapping, we show that these internal/external networks are more interlocked than previously thought. Although spontaneous DN and dATN activity during rest is uncorrelated at the network level, functional coupling across networks is shaped by the latent visual field preferences of individual voxels in each network, as measured during independent retinotopic mapping. Voxels that share visual field preferences exhibit stronger spontaneous coupling than those with divergent preferences. These retinotopically-specific interactions are bivalent: DN voxels with negative (suppressive) visual response amplitudes are anticorrelated with matched (positive) dATN voxels, while those with positive response amplitudes are positively correlated. Thus, distinct subpopulations of visually-tuned DN voxels participate in spatially-specific interactions with the dATN. Further, retinotopic coding is intrinsic to the DN, persisting even during periods of elevated top-down drive from the DN to the dATN. These findings challenge the prevailing view of global DN-dATN antagonism, revealing a latent, voxel-level architecture of retinotopically-grounded interactions. Taken together, our results suggest that retinotopic coding underpins the dynamic coordination of perception and thought in the human brain.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Transcriptional plasticity is one mechanism that enables broad host use in polyphagous insect herbivores; however, whether specialist herbivores use transcriptional plasticity or undergo epigenome modifications to cope with host shifts remains largely unexplored. We measured the transcriptome and epigenome of the specialist aphid herbivore, Daktulosphaira vitifoliae, after transfer to new hosts using RNA-seq and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing. We found the transcriptome of D. vitifoliae is highly plastic and responsive to host genotype - 3,706 genes (28% of expressed genes) are significantly differentially expressed in at least one contrast comparing host genotypes. Most host-responsive genes (2,667 genes) were upregulated when feeding on the non-native host Vitis vinifera and enriched for genes encoding predicted secretory effectors, detoxification enzymes, and cuticle- and chitin-associated proteins. We found gene co-expression modules that correlated with variation in fitness suggesting plasticity in transcriptional networks contributes to D. vitifoliae adaptation to host plants. We also identified a previously undescribed family of proline-rich secretory proteins conserved across the Aphidomorpha infraorder of insects. Unlike the transcriptome, DNA methylation did not dramatically respond to host transfer and positively correlated with stably expressed genes; thus, gene body DNA methylation may help stabilize gene expression when insects move to new host environments.

In the chick brainstem auditory circuit, the pattern of nodal spacing varies regionally along single axons, enabling precise binaural integration for sound localization.

The structure of axons did not affect internodal length. Inhibiting vesicular release from the axons did not affect internodal length or oligodendrocyte morphology, but caused unmyelinated segments on the axons by suppressing oligodendrogenesis near the presynaptic terminals. These results suggest that the regional heterogeneity in the intrinsic properties of oligodendrocytes is a prominent determinant of the biased nodal spacing pattern in the sound localization circuit, while activity-dependent signaling supports the pattern by ensuring adequate oligodendrocyte density.

The complexity of this response is further complicated by cell-to-cell heterogeneity in the expression of bacterial stress response genes. These genes are often organized into networks comprising one or more transcriptional regulators that control expression of a suite of downstream genes. While the expression heterogeneity of many of these upstream regulators has been characterized, the way in which this variability affects the larger downstream stress response remains hard to predict, prompting two key questions. First, how does heterogeneity and expression noise in stress response regulators propagate to the diverse downstream genes in their regulons? Second, when expression levels vary, how do upstream and downstream genes act together to protect cells from stress? To address these questions, we focus on the transcription factor PhoP, a critical virulence regulator which coordinates pathogenicity in several gram-negative species. We use optogenetic stimulation to precisely control PhoP expression levels and utilize information theory to examine how variations in PhoP affect the downstream activation of genes in the PhoP regulon. We find that these downstream genes exhibit differences in mean expression level, sensitivity to increasing levels of PhoP, and signal transmission reliability. These response functions can also vary between individual cells, increasing heterogeneity in the population. We tie these variations to cell survival when bacteria are exposed to a clinically-relevant antimicrobial peptide, showing that while high expression of the PhoP-regulon gene pmrD provides a protective effect against Polymyxin B, cell survival chances are best determined by integrated dynamic PhoP and pmrD expression levels. Overall, we demonstrate that cell-to-cell and temporal heterogeneous expression of a stress response regulator can have clear consequences for enabling bacteria to survive stress.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

While the pharmacological inhibition of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling by Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors is initially effective, the development of resistance remains a challenge in treating MZL and other B-cell malignancies. Enhancer activation remodeling is a key epigenetic mechanism that enables tumor adaptation during therapy. The most active regulatory regions cluster in super-enhancers and produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), a class of unstable noncoding transcripts that primarily serve as scaffolds for chromatin looping. However, when stabilized, these eRNAs can evolve into long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) with distinct functions. To investigate enhancer-associated long non-coding RNAs (elncRNAs) involved in shaping BCR pathway dependence, we conducted a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen in MZL cells. We identified LOC730338, an elncRNA linked to A-to-I RNA editing, which we renamed ADARreg. ADARreg renders tumor cells refractory to BCR pathway inhibition by modulating ADAR2 nuclear translocation and altering RNA modification patterns in key regulatory isoforms through coordinated control of RNA stability and localization, as revealed through subcellular direct RNA sequencing (DRS). In addition, ADARreg induces an immune-suppressive transcriptional program, increasing the production of inhibitory cytokines and receptors that diminish NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

In interphase, Rga4 appear punctate at the cell sides restricted from the growing ends. During mitosis, Rga4 appears homogeneous and localizes to the ends. We show that this cell-cycle-dependent Rga4 localization is septin cytoskeleton-dependent. Septins forms linear filaments along the sides during interphase. In mitosis, the septins recede from the sides and form a ring at the division site. In septin mutants, Rga4 is mobile, homogeneously distributed and localizes to the ends, regardless of cell-cycle stage. Accordingly, septin mutants show delayed Cdc42 reactivation after division and are monopolar with disrupted Cdc42 activation dynamics.

Using the fast infinitesimal time coalescent process (FitCoal), which precisely computes the expected site frequency spectrum (SFS), we revisited the debated population bottleneck that occurred approximately 930 thousand years ago. By benchmarking FitCoal against mushi and ten billion coalescent simulations, we demonstrate that FitCoal achieves both superior speed and accuracy in expected SFS estimation. Analyses of simulated datasets confirmed that FitCoal reliably recovered the bottleneck, whereas mushi failed under identical conditions. Independent fossil and paleoclimate evidence further corroborates the timing and evolutionary impact of this bottleneck, linking it to hominin dispersals, speciation events, and a subsequent increase in brain size. These findings refine the demographic history of Homo during the Pleistocene and highlight the importance of high-precision SFS computation for revealing critical evolutionary transitions that shaped modern human ancestry.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

However, DNA storage is a complex process where each stage introduces noise and errors. Since running DNA data storage experiments in vitro is still expensive and time-consuming, a simulation model is quite necessary that can mimic the error patterns in the real data and simulate the experiments. Existing tools often rely on fixed error rates or are specific to certain technologies. We propose DDS-E-Sim, a transformer-based probabilistic generative framework that simulates errors in a DNA data storage channel, regardless of the process or technology. DDS-E-Sim successfully captures the error distribution of DNA storage pipelines and learns to stochastically generate erroneous DNA reads. Given oligos (DNA sequences to write), it outputs erroneous reads resembling real pipelines capturing both random and biased errors, such as k-mer and transition errors. Evaluations on two distinct technology-specific datasets show high fidelity and universality: DDS-E-SIM exhibit a total error rate deviation of only 0.1% and 0.7% respectively on the datasets processed with Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore. Additionally, our simulator generates 100,743 unique oligos from 35,329 sequences, with coverage 5 (each sequence read five times) in the test datasets, demonstrating its ability to simulate biased errors and stochastic properties simultaneously.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

The sensorimotor cortex is central to controlling these complex movements, yet how the detailed command signals are distributed across its numerous subregions remains unclear. In particular, in mice it is unknown if the primary motor (M1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices represent low-level joint angle details in addition to high-level signals like movement direction. Here, we combine high quality markerless tracking and two-photon imaging during a reach-to-grasp task to quantify movement-related activity in the mouse forelimb M1 (M1-fl) and forelimb S1 (S1-fl). Linear decoding models reveal a strong representation of proximal and distal joint angles in both areas, and both areas support joint angle decoding with comparable fidelity. Despite shared low-level encoding, the time course of high-level target-specific information varied across areas. M1-fl exhibited early onset and sustained encoding of target-specific signals while S1-fl was more transiently modulated around lift onset. These results reveal both shared and unique contributions of M1-fl and S1-fl to reaching and grasping, implicating a more distributed cortical circuit for mouse forelimb control than has been previously considered.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Social interactions between conspecifics are hypothesized to be important in facilitating mate choice and reproductive success but are difficult to measure. Using data from 52 adult barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster), whose social interactions were measured via proximity tags, we tested the hypothesis that social interactions mediate the relationship between age (a proxy for experience) and condition-dependent plumage traits, and their associations with reproductive success. We found that older female barn swallows had higher fecundity and that older males have higher paternity. Older males achieved higher paternity through extra pair copulations, not by greater paternity with their social mate. Longer tail streamers were associated with greater fecundity/paternity in both sexes, but this effect was independent of age only among females. Darker ventral plumage coloration was not associated with higher reproductive success in either sex. We also observed that older birds appear to be less social with conspecifics, as indicated by fewer numbers of social interactions, though these associations were only marginally significant in males. Interestingly, females with fewer social interactions had higher fecundity. Finally, we found no evidence of mediation by the number of social interactions. Taken together, our results suggest that older, more experienced birds can produce more offspring while being less social.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Consequently, Optimal Foraging has been widely studied, but mainly in relatively complex animals with strong sensory and cognitive abilities. However, most living organisms, from bacteria to lower invertebrates, lack these abilities and still must forage efficiently. Here we extend one of the main theorems in Optimal Foraging, the Marginal Value Theorem, to organisms with minimal sensory and cognitive abilities; in particular, we consider individuals whose only sensory input is their feeding rate. To do so, we reformulate a continuous version of the Marginal Value Theorem, finding that individuals should adapt their speed to achieve a marginal feeding rate equal to the average feeding rate for the environment whenever possible, where the marginal feeding rate is defined as the feeding rate they would have if they returned to an already-visited location. We also find that, when faced with uncertainty, moving intermittently is more efficient than moving at constant speed, because this speed variability enables more robust estimates of the marginal feeding rate. Our results generalize Optimal Foraging Theory to organisms with strong sensory constraints, and unify classical results derived for patchy environments to those applicable in arbitrary environments.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

I.", "abstract": "In the human commensal Gram-positive bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, the essential cell-division-associated peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolase PcsB interacts directly with the membrane-bound FtsEX complex (1-3). PcsB contains a cysteine, histidine-dependent amidohydrolase/peptidase (CHAP) domain responsible for PG hydrolysis, and a coiled-coil domain required for interaction with FtsEX (1,4). ATP hydrolysis of FtsE in the cytoplasm drives conformational changes in FtsX in the cytoplasmic membrane, which ultimately regulates the PG hydrolase on the outside of the cell (5). In this work we show that the CHAP domain of PcsB predominately functions as an D-iso-Glutaminyl-Lysyl D,L-endopeptidase, with substrate specificity for Lys-containing, amidated PG. The catalytic activity of PcsB is regulated by conformational changes of the coiled-coil region and by a short helical region immediately adjacent to the CHAP domain, to guard against PcsB hydrolytic activation outside of its cell division specific functional requirement. This work supports a model for the overall biological activity of the FtsEX-PcsB complex, allowing stem peptide cleavage that splits the septal disk and marks a region of the peptidoglycan sacculus for subsequent cell division remodelling.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Building on this, we evaluated herein two additional candidates, simvastatin (a cholesterol-lowering drug) and primaquine (an antimalarial), based on strong endometrial gene expression reversal scores and favorable safety profiles. Using the rat model, we conducted behavioral testing, bulk RNA sequencing, and differential expression analysis to assess their therapeutic potential. We also assessed endometriosis diagnosis among patients prescribed simvastatin in electronic medical records (EMR) across six University of California (UC) healthcare institutions. In vivo validation using a rat model of endometriosis demonstrated that both simvastatin and primaquine significantly reduced vaginal hyperalgesia, a surrogate marker of endometriosis-related pain. RNA-seq of uteri and lesions confirmed reversal of disease-associated gene expression signatures following treatment. Analysis of UC-wide EMR data found lower relative risk of endometriosis among those prescribed simvastatin compared to a matched control group. Overall, simvastatin and primaquine attenuated pain-associated behaviors and reversed endometriosis-related gene expression changes in an animal model. Moreover, simvastatin prescription was associated with a lower relative risk of endometriosis in our retrospective multi-center cohort study.

However, this relies on clustering genes by sequence similarity, a process that is far less deterministic than often assumed. This study introduces PyamilySeq, a transparent and flexible toolkit designed to diagnose and quantify hidden biases within gene clustering and pangenome inference methodologies. Using PyamilySeq, we can see how clustering thresholds (often hard-coded and poorly documented) and paralog handling can substantially alter gene family composition. Surprisingly, even parameters unrelated to clustering, such as decimal precision (0.8 vs. 0.80), output selection, and even CPU and memory allocation, can alter gene family assignments, challenging the assumption that identical clustering thresholds yield consistent results. Furthermore, tools often fail to report biologically meaningful or representative sequences for gene families, undermining downstream analyses. These findings reveal systematic fragilities in gene clustering and pangenome construction and highlight that pangenomics is not merely a data-driven task but a methodological one, where transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability are as critical as biological insight. This work calls for a re-evaluation of how pangenomes are constructed and compared, and advocates for methodologies that make their assumptions explicit and their results verifiable.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Human Siglecs count 14 unique proteins allocated to two subsets; group 1 includes four evolutionarily conserved proteins with clear orthologues in all mammals with low sequence similarity and group 2 includes ten rapidly evolving proteins with high sequence similarity and species specificity. In all Siglecs, the recognition and binding of the sialic acid on the glycan target involves a conserved, or canonical, Arg residue. Yet, for a subset of human Siglecs, namely MAG, Siglec-6, and Siglec-11, this Arg appears not to be essential, suggesting that a different binding mechanism may be at play. In this work, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding assays, and mutagenesis to investigate the structural, mechanistic and energetic details of the binding of Siglec-6 to monosialylated gangliosides. Our results show that Siglec-6 relies only partially on its conserved Arg (Arg122) for recognition of membrane-bound gangliosides and that it supplements its binding free energy through interactions with the phospholipids in the membrane surrounding the target epitope. We identified residues Lys126 and Trp127 as key players in this unique membrane interaction, and we confirmed by mutagenesis assays that the loss of these residues abrogates binding. These results provide a step-change in our understanding of the diversification of human Siglecs across group 2, where different members likely evolved as molecular precision tools, to bind specific sialosides by adapting their structure to recognize not only the epitope, but also the biological environment in which it is found.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Aspr is dispensable for wing development but is strongly induced within 24 hours post-injury. Maintaining aspr expression inhibits differentiation and alters reparative growth, while loss impairs regeneration. Structural and expression analyses show Aspr is an extracellular protein secreted in extracellular vesicles (EVs), where it co-localizes with the WNT ligand Wingless (Wg).

To maintain photosynthetic efficiency, benthic diatoms have developed protective strategies, including mobilization of the antioxidant xanthophyll cycle and the ability to migrate vertically through sediments. However, mechanistic understanding of signaling pathways underlying migration remains poorly characterized. This study investigated the triggering effect of reactive oxygen species on behavioral and photophysiological responses through the analysis of lipophilic pigments and fluorescence parameters. To this end, two microphytobenthic communities, one with sediment allowing vertical migration and another without sediment restricting it, were exposed to irradiance, cold atmospheric plasma, and hydrogen peroxide stresses. Results showed a consistent downward migration response under all oxidative stresses, highlighting the key role of reactive oxygen species, especially hydrogen peroxide, in triggering this microphytobenthic behavior. Moreover, a difference was observed between the pathways involved in vertical migration and those underlying photoprotective responses. Hydrogen peroxide and cold atmospheric plasma stresses highlighted the necessity for substantial microphytobenthic migration, whereas irradiance induced a specific and controlled response involving engagement of the xanthophyll cycle, acting in synergy with the migration strategy by showing stronger activation when migration was impaired. By establishing that a rapid and efficient migration could be induced by reactive oxygen species and could act in synergy with the xanthophyll cycle in epipelic cells, this study provides key insights into the molecular basis of microphytobenthic responses to cellular and environmental oxidative stresses.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that pyrophilous fungi employ specialized genomic adaptations for C and N cycling, with evolutionary trade-offs between traits governing aromatic C degradation, N acquisition pathways, and rapid growth. To test these hypotheses, we performed complementary comparative genomics, transcriptomics after pyrogenic organic matter amendment, and growth rate bioassays for 18 pyrophilous fungi from five Ascomycota (Eurotiales, Pleosporales, Sordariales, Coniochaetales, and Pezizales) and three Basidiomycota (Agaricales, Holtermaniales, and Geminibasidiales) orders isolated from burned soils. We found a dramatic trait trade-off between fast growth and number of genes responsible for aromatic C degradation, implying burned environments select for metabolically costly genes despite their evolutionary cost. We used the comparative genomics framework to evaluate genomic signatures of evolution and found that either gene duplication and somatic mutation, or recombination via sexual reproduction, were the primary drivers of fungal genomic variation in aromatic C degradation and N acquisition genes. Finally, we identified cross-kingdom bacterial to fungal horizontal gene transfer as a secondary strategy producing novel aromatic C degradation genes.

One hypothesis is that the entorhinal cortex (EC) meets this challenge by forming factorised representations that allow for increased neural similarity between events that share generalisable features. We tested this hypothesis using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Female and male participants (n=40) were trained to report behavioural sequences based on an underlying graph structure. Participants then made decisions in a new environment where some, but not all graph transitions from the previous structure could be generalised. Behavioural results showed that participants distinguished the generalisable transition information. Accuracy was significantly higher in blocks where sequence transitions were shared across environments, than those in which transitions differed. This boost in accuracy was especially pronounced during early exposure to the novel environment. Throughout this early phase, neural patterns in EC showed a corresponding differentiation of the generalisable aspects. Neural patterns representing starting locations in familiar and novel environments were significantly more similar in EC on trials where sequences could be generalised from prior experience, compared to trials with new sequential transitions. This signalling was associated with improved performance when prior sequence knowledge could be reused.

Non-foamy macrophages express higher levels of inflammarafts - enlarged, cholesterol-rich lipid rafts hosting assemblies of inflammatory receptors - compared to foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions of Ldlr-/- mice. Apolipoprotein A-I binding protein (AIBP) has been shown to control lipid raft dynamics. This study investigated the effect of systemic AIBP deficiency on inflammaraft expression in foam cells and non-foamy macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions of hypercholesterolemic mice. A larger number of foam cells, with increased neutral lipid accumulation, populated atherosclerotic lesions in Apoa1bp-/-Ldlr-/- mice compared to Ldlr-/- mice. Importantly, AIBP-deficient foam cells expressed higher levels of TLR4 dimers and lipid rafts (markers of inflammarafts) than control mice, accompanied by larger atherosclerotic lesions and larger necrotic cores compared to Ldlr-/- mice. In a model of foam cells, Apoa1bp-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages incubated with oxidized LDL had increased expression of inflammation- and atherosclerosis-related genes. These results indicate that AIBP deficiency is associated with a proinflammatory transition of foam cells in which increased lipid accumulation is paradoxically associated with an increased expression of inflammarafts and correlates with the development of advanced atherosclerotic plaques.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Metabolic phenotype of male and female mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) receiving twice a week intraperitoneal injections of EVs or vehicle for six weeks was assessed. Results In HFD-fed mice for 6 weeks, EVPP-Adpn improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, promoted adipocyte lipid storage through insulin-regulated lipogenesis and alleviated key features of MASH lesions (liver steatosis and inflammation, and in a lesser extent liver fibrosis). EVPP-Adpn lowered circulating ceramides and reduced FGF21 indicating improved hepatic metabolism. EVPP-Adpn also activated AKT and AMPK pathways in liver and skeletal muscle, consistent with increased adiponectin signaling Conclusions/interpretation Our results demonstrate that surface-anchored Adpn EVs restore tissue-specific insulin signaling and ameliorate metabolic dysfunctions in obese mice, highlighting their potential as a novel biotherapeutic strategy for T2D and MASH.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we evaluate the performance of statistical differential expression methods on both simulated datasets and data collected from 'mock communities' (mixtures of bacterial cells of different types in defined ratios) designed for this purpose. We assess the robustness of individual methods to organisms' low relative abundance, differential abundance, low prevalence, transcription rate changes, and compositional effects, showing that no existing methods perform adequately across all confounding conditions. We then apply the same approaches to metatranscriptomic datasets generated from gnotobiotic mice colonized with defined consortia of human bacterial strains and show that the method nominated by the mock community comparisons successfully inferred cross-feeding dynamics that were subsequently validated in vitro. Finally, using metagenome-assembled genomes from a human clinical study, we leverage genome-level sequencing depth and detection of genes to exclude low information samples on a per-organism basis to overcome confounding low prevalence and enhance differential expression inference. We conclude that MTX method benchmarking on real, not simulated, datasets can and should optimize model implementation, enabling inference and validation of microbial metabolic strategies and interactions from in vivo datasets.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography is an important tool in assessing white matter connectivity and brain tissue microstructure across different populations. Whole brain white matter analysis using dMRI tractography for group statistical comparison is a challenging task due to the large number of white matter connections. In this work, we study whole-brain white matter connectivity differences between females and males using dMRI tractography. We study a large cohort of 707 healthy adult subjects from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset. By applying a well-established fiber clustering pipeline and a suprathreshold fiber cluster statistical method, we evaluated tracts in the cerebral cortex, as well as those connecting to regions such as the cerebellum, which have been relatively less studied using dMRI tractography. We identified several tracts that differed significantly between females and males in terms of their fractional anisotropy and/or mean diffusivity. These included several deep white matter tracts (e.g., arcuate fasciculus, corticospinal tract, and corpus callosum) that have been previously shown to have sex differences, as well as superficial white matter tracts in the frontal lobe. However, there were relatively few cortical association tracts that exhibited significant sex differences. We also identified cerebellar tracts with sex differences. Finally, correlation analysis revealed that these white matter differences were linked to a range of neurobehavioral measures, with the strongest and most consistent associations observed for motor function. Overall, these findings provide characterizations of sex differences in the white matter and indicate that the circuits underlying motor function may be an important focus of future work on sex differences in the human brain.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "ObjectiveThis study evaluated the hypothesis that baseline tissue oxygen (pO2) would modulate FLASH damage sparing in murine skin, comparing MeV electron ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) versus conventional dose rate (CDR) irradiations.\n\nApproachMurine leg skin pO2 was systematically varied and measured during irradiation from a Mobetron 9 MeV linac at 25 Gy, comparing UHDR ({approx}240 Gy/s) to CDR ({approx}0.16 Gy/s), for skin damage outcomes. Radiolytic oxygen consumption, go2 (mmHg/Gy), was also quantified in vivo. Baseline tissue pO2 was systematically modulated in 5 different treatment cohorts, using known methods of altering the inhaled gas (room air, 100% oxygen, or carbogen) and through applied limb vascular compression (partial or full). Induced skin damage was scored daily per mouse.\n\nMain ResultsFLASH skin sparing was observed in groups with partial leg clamping (pO2{approx}7{+/-}4mmHg), inhaled air (pO2{approx}12{+/-}6mmHg) and oxygen (tissue pO2{approx}16{+/-}4mmHg), while reduction in ulceration progression was significant just in the air inhalation group. No FLASH effect was observed at zero oxygen, via complete blood flow occlusion (pO2{approx}0{+/-}1mmHg), or when modulated by inhaled carbogen (pO2{approx}21{+/-}7mmHg). In vivo measurements of radiolytic consumption, go2, correlated to initial pO2 when FLASH was present (pO2{approx}4-16mmHg) and saturated above pO2>16mmHg. Inspired carbogen induced the highest pO2 and maximum damage at 25 Gy. Reductions in dose to 20 and 15 Gy reduced skin damage with carbogen, but did not result in FLASH sparing.\n\nSignificanceThese findings indicate that tissue pO2 directly modulates in vivo FLASH skin tissue sparing, requiring roughly room air or 100% oxygen anesthetic gas levels for this effect to be present. The effect is diminished by the absence of oxygen or from carbogen induced oxygen values. Variations in dose do not appear to alter this observation at carbogen induced pO2 levels.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Advances in soluble gp140 trimer design have provided insight into the ectodomain structure and dynamics. However, the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) and transmembrane domain (TMD) are comparatively understudied, and knowledge of the cytoplasmic tail (CT) is virtually absent. Additionally, the ectodomain and TMD have been investigated separately in previous studies. To investigate the trimeric gp120-gp41 as a complete entity and its structural flexibility, we built a full-length model of the gp120-gp41 trimer that is fully glycosylated with N-linked glycans and embedded in a lipid bilayer, and performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that the ectodomain maintains a rigid internal structure stable in the prefusion state, whereas the intrinsic flexibility of the MPER enables the ectodomain to adopt a range of tilted orientations, potentially enhancing spatial alignment for receptor engagement. The centrally positioned R696 residue in the TMD interacts with lipid headgroups, ions, and the CT residues, resulting in conformational variability in the TMD and perturbations in the surrounding membrane that may facilitate the fusion process.

Here, we further show that SETDB1 modulates the TGFbeta-induced secretome, particularly by regulating ECM-related proteins. Comparison of the basal secretome from DMD patient-derived myotubes and healthy controls revealed a distinct disease-specific profile. Integrating both secretome analyses, we identified EMILIN1, an ECM glycoprotein not previously studied in skeletal muscle, as a robust shared candidate; EMILIN1 is enriched in the DMD secretome, further upregulated by TGFbeta and downregulated upon SETDB1 depletion. We confirmed EMILIN1 overexpression in DMD patient muscle biopsies, validating its pathological relevance. Functionally, EMILIN1 depletion modulated myogenic differentiation and reduced expression of the fibrotic marker SERPINE1. These findings establish EMILIN1 as a novel secreted regulator of myogenesis and fibrosis, and implicate SETDB1 in shaping the TGFbeta-dependent secretome in DMD.

The ontogeny of cognitive traits is likely influenced by both population-wide pressures, such as ecological demands, and individual-specific factors, including early life experiences. To properly investigate cognitive variation, we must therefore identify species-level developmental trajectories and individual variation from normative ontogeny. We studied the ontogeny of three cognitive traits-inhibition control, spatial cognition, and physical problem-solving skills-in 28 wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) from eight litters (seven groups). Our longitudinal study followed individuals from early life to nutritional independence and into sub-adulthood. We found that rates of development (learning curves) varied among traits, reflecting the timing of socio-ecological pressures in this species. Performance of cognitive traits did not correlate over ontogeny nor at specific time points, suggesting independent processes underlying each measured trait. While the development of inhibitory control appeared conserved, that of spatial cognition and physical problem-solving showed substantive individual differences. Furthermore, only physical problem-solving showed consistency in performances over time, emerging near nutritional independence, reflecting its ecological importance early in life.

Chronic activation of the Integrated Stress Response is linked to AD, typically through eIF2alpha phosphorylation, which selectively enhances translation of key stress-responsive mRNAs like ATF4 and BACE1. We investigated a novel regulatory mechanism mediated by Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta a hyperactive kinase in AD, on the translational factor eIF2B, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eIF2. The methodology combined cellular and molecular biology approaches (western blot, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and luciferase assays) using pharmacological inhibitors and plasmid transfection in established cell models, along with computational structural modeling (AlphaFold3). Findings were validated in post-mortem human brain tissue, with statistical analyses (t-tests and ANOVA) applied throughout. We treated cells (SH-SY5Y) with a GSK-3beta inhibitor (NP031112) or overexpressed a constitutively active GSK-3beta mutant (GSK-3beta-S9A) to modulate GSK-3beta activity. GSK-3beta inhibition significantly reduced ATF4 and BACE1 protein levels in SH-SY5Y cells in a dose-dependent manner as we tested by western blot (P<0.001), independent of eIF2alpha phosphorylation. This effect was translational, as the inhibitor still reduced BACE1 levels when transcription was blocked. Crucially, NP031112 reversed stress-induced eIF2Bepsilon phosphorylation at Ser540 (P<0.001). Furthermore, H2O2-induced Abeta1-42 secretion by SH-SY5Y cells was significantly reversed by GSK-3beta inhibition (P<0.001). Luciferase reporter assays using the BACE1 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) confirmed that both eIF2Bepsilon silencing and a phosphomimetic mutant eIF2Bepsilon-S540E increased BACE1 5' UTR-driven translation (P<0.001), demonstrating that reduced functional eIF2B enhances BACE1 translation. Finally, immunohistofluorescence and western blot analysis of human AD hippocampi showed a significant increase in pS540-eIF2Bepsilon, ATF4, and BACE1 levels in AD patients compared to non-demented controls (P<0.001 for all three). Our findings establish a novel GSK-3beta-eIF2Bepsilon-BACE1 axis that links stress response dysregulation to amyloidogenesis, independent of canonical eIF2alpha phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of eIF2Bepsilon functionally mimics the effects of eIF2alpha phosphorylation by reducing the available functional eIF2B pool, thereby reprogramming translation to favour the production of stress proteins like ATF4 and BACE1.

Reconstructing evolutionary histories, called species networks, under this model is notoriously challenging, with the leading methods scaling to just tens of species. Divide-and-conquer is a promising path forward; however, methods with statistical consistency guarantees require the tree of blobs (TOB), which displays only the tree-like parts of the network, to perform subset decomposition. TOB reconstruction under the NMSC is challenging in its own right, with the only available method TINNiK having time complexity O(n^5 + n^4k), where k is the number of input gene trees and n is the number of species. Here, we present a framework for TOB reconstruction that operates by (1) seeking a refinement of the TOB and then (2) contracting edges in it. For step (1), we show that an optimal solution to Weighted Quartet Consensus is a TOB refinement almost surely, as the number of gene trees increases, motivating the use of fast quartet-based methods for species tree estimation such as ASTRAL or TREE-QMC. For step (2), we contract edges in the refinement tree based on the same hypothesis tests as TINNiK, which are applicable to subsets of four taxa. We show that sampling just O(n) four-taxon subsets around each edge enables statistically consistent TOB estimation, with asymptotic runtime dominated by tree reconstruction. Leveraging TREE-QMC for this step gives our method a time complexity of O(n^3k) and its name TOB-QMC. On simulated data sets, TOB-QMC is at least as accurate and often more accurate than TINNiK. Moreover, TOB-QMC scales to larger data sets and enables fast and interpretable exploration of hyperparameters used in hypothesis testing. We demonstrate the importance of this feature on phylogenomic data sets. Lastly, our framework is related to ad hoc analyses performed by biologists, as network methods do not scale. Our theoretical results provide justification for such approaches as well as context for interpreting species trees estimated with quartet-based methods in the presence of gene flow; this is critical given the recent result that tree-based network inference with ASTRAL can be positively misleading.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

We examined dyadic coordination in a non-human primate model of ASD, focusing on gaze and inter-individual distance during minimally constrained first encounters between prenatal valproic acid-exposed marmosets (VPA) and unexposed conspecifics (UE). Markerless pose estimation quantified frame-by-frame gaze direction and spacing, comparing VPA-UE with UE-UE dyads. VPA-UE pairs exhibited a higher proportion of mutual-gaze events than UE-UE pairs. VPA individuals showed more rapid looks in response to the partner's gaze, yet spent less time looking at the partner when unobserved. VPA-UE dyads maintained shorter inter-individual distances than UE-UE dyads, and closer spacing was associated with decreased stability of mutual gaze. These findings reveal a dyadic coordination pattern in VPA-UE pairs, with rapid responsiveness coupled with distance-dependent fragility, paralleling features reported in human ASD.

Here, we develop a novel polyploid genome simulation engine DemographiKS to demonstrate that the Ks histogram, one of the most broadly utilized methods for inferring WGD events, is highly sensitive to evolutionary parameters relating to the mode of origin, as well as demographic parameters such as migration events, population bottlenecks and expansions. Our results show that that the location of the Ks peak may correspond to the time of parental divergence (for allopolyploids); might be hidden at Ks=0 (for autopolyploids under a population contraction); may correspond to the mean time of coalescence of the diploid ancestor (for autopolyploids under a population expansion), or the time of most recent migration between the parental species (for allopolyploids). We also fit simulated Ks histograms to polyploid genomes from four well-studied plant lineages on the polyploid continuum (Coffea arabica, Zea mays, Populus trichocarpa, and Saccharum spontaneum), demonstrating that WGD simulations may be used to corroborate inferred demographies. In summary, we demonstrate that Ks histograms are information-rich, computationally tractable, and can be utilized to corroborate detailed evolutionary histories inferred by other methods.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Yet, the transitory nature of EHT and the limited availability of molecular markers has constrained our understanding of the origin, identity and differentiation dynamics of EMPs. Here, we have refined the annotation of yolk sac haemato-vascular populations in publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) datasets from mouse embryos to identify novel molecular markers of haemogenic endothelium and EMPs. By sub-clustering key cell populations followed by pseudotime analysis, we refined cluster annotations and then reconstructed differentiation trajectories. Subsequent differential gene expression analysis between clusters identified novel cell surface markers for haemogenic endothelial cells (Fxyd5 and Scarf1) and EMPs (Fcer1g, Tyrobp and Mctp1). Further, we have identified candidate signalling and metabolic pathways that may regulate yolk sac haematopoietic emergence and differentiation. The specificity of FXYD5, SCARF1 and FCER1G for haemogenic endothelium and EMPs was validated by immunostaining of mouse yolk sac. These insights into the transcriptional dynamics in the yolk sac should support future investigation of EHT and haematopoietic differentiation during early mammalian development.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

In this paper, I introduce an algebraic framework that provides a quantitative representation of the general phenotypic traits of asexual populations, enabling the systematic modeling of DE processes. Within this framework, key evolutionary quantities such as the time required for a DE to reach a desired trait or the probability of arriving at a target algebra can be computed or qualitatively analyzed using principles from the evolutionary dynamics of an asexual population. As illustrative examples of trait-representing algebras, I evolve an integer, a two-dimensional vector, a four-dimensional vector with modulo-4 elements, a 2 by 2 matrix, and a cyclic algebra. The generations needed to reach the objective algebra in the DE simulations were consistent with those predicted by the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, I propose a method for mathematically designing evolutionary pathways that minimize the generations needed to reach the desired algebra, offering a key criterion for improving the efficiency of DE. Finally, I discuss how this algebraic approach can be applied in practical experimental setups and outline directions for future research in algebraic modeling of evolution.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Brain charts, which are estimates of MRI phenotypes across covariates such as age and sex, can be used to construct reference intervals. However, the reference data used to fit intervals often differs from a new sample in terms of study design, MRI acquisition, and image preprocessing. Application of MRI reference intervals to new samples remains a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method called Reference interval calibration via conFormal prediction (ReForm) that adjusts reference intervals for a new sample. Our method builds on recent work in conformal prediction, which yields intervals with guaranteed coverage for new observations. Through resampling experiments in Lifespan Brain Chart Consortium cortical thickness data, we compare ReFormed reference intervals to refitting intervals, statistical harmonization methods, and model-based adjustment of intervals. Notably for patient privacy concerns, ReForm does not require sharing of reference data. Yet, our empirical results demonstrate that ReForm controls FPR similarly or better than alternative methods which require sharing reference data.

Achieving efficient directed evolution (DE) requires a quantitative formulation of the experimental methodologies-or logics-that can address potential challenges throughout the evolutionary process. In this article, I introduce ten logics designed for specific purposes in DE, accompanied by their mathematical formulations. To illustrate their application, I consider a hypothetical scenario of evolving an imaginary asexual population limb into a wing, employing a matrix-based discretization method to represent the trait of interest. The results indicate that applying these logics can accelerate the evolutionary process by roughly tenfold, while achieving an average accuracy of approximately 85% in reaching the desired trait across ten simulation iterations. Based on these findings, I discuss key considerations for implementing quantitative logic-based DE, propose strategies to improve alignment between the final outcome and the target trait, and examine factors for making the discretization method practical.

While SOX10's transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes is well characterized, its role on microRNA (miRNA) regulatory landscape in UM remains unexplored. Here, we employed network-based modeling to systematically characterize miRNA regulatory functions following SOX10 depletion in UM. First, we profiled mRNA and miRNA expression levels in SOX10 wild-type and knockdown UM cells. Then, we integrated the transcriptomic data, a UM network, and a Bayesian model to quantify miRNAs' regulatory activities and identify key miRNAs. Subsequently, we employed pathway enrichment analysis combined with literature mining to elucidate the functional roles of identified miRNAs through their target genes and associated signaling pathways in UM. We identified 17 miRNAs that show significant changes in regulatory activities following SOX10 knockdown in UM cells. These miRNAs regulate the expression of genes involved in cancer hallmark pathways, including cell cycle progression, mTORC1 signaling, and fatty acid metabolism. Notably, miR-34a, miR-25, miR-186, and miR-211 have tumor-suppressive potential by targeting genes involved in UM progression and metastasis.

Most research on chromatin dynamics during the cell cycle has primarily focused on events surrounding mitosis, providing only limited insight into chromatin behavior during S-phase. To address this gap, we developed a simple, drug-free approach that combines the Fucci cell-cycle indicator with in situ Hi-C to comprehensively analyze A/B compartment dynamics throughout interphase in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Unexpectedly, and contrary to prevailing views, we found that A/B compartment strength increased abruptly upon S-phase entry, stabilized during S-phase, and subsequently declined in late S/G2. This abrupt strengthening, which we termed  compartment maturation, required passage through the G1/S transition but was independent of active DNA synthesis. This maturation involved substantial architectural remodeling, particularly within the A compartment, which consolidated into a more organized structure as individual A domains rearranged to form long-range interactions. Moreover, compartment maturation was not limited to mESCs but was also observed across different developmental contexts in mice. Based on these observations, we propose a revised, stepwise model of nuclear compartmentalization during cell-cycle progression, consisting of four distinct stages: chromosome unfolding (G1), chromatin maturation (G1/S), stabilization (S phase), and refolding (G2). These findings reveal the unexpected plasticity of A/B compartments and underscore the G1/S transition as a critical period for their reorganization.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) as one of the main animal models in biomedicine and toxicology are currently kept in barren tanks in most experimental setups, as well as in animal husbandry. Structural enrichment with artificial plants is currently discussed as a potential refinement measure to provide a more diverse environment. It was shown, that this can reduce stress and improve cognitive abilities, survival rate and fertility in these animals. Still, concerns remain regarding its long-term benefits and drawbacks. Therefore, we introduced artificial plants in our husbandry tanks, and evaluated over a one-year period if in our specific system, the benefits would outweigh the risks. Comparing six different lines of zebrafish raised in enriched tanks or under our standard conditions, we saw no significant difference in terms of sex ratio, fertility or pathogen burden. Enrichment increased the survival rate of 4 % during upbringing, albeit not statistically significant due to high variation. When analyzing zebrafish behavior in their 8 L home-tanks, we found less zebrafish in areas close to the plants but rather a preference for the open water in the middle or opposite side of the tank. This effect was even more pronounced at lower holding densities of less than 4 fish per liter. In summary, we found that introducing structural enrichment to our zebrafish facility carried low cost and no detrimental effects for the animals but at the same time benefits were difficult to determine in our readouts as our survival rates already were very high without these measures. We like to encourage other animal facilities to evaluate enrichment measures to ensure a broader discussion on long-term benefits of structural enrichment in zebrafish husbandry systems.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

PRINS editing, a PEn variant utilizing springRNAs, uniquely relies on non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) for insertions, providing an insertion-only strategy ideal for functional protein tagging or serine integrase landing pad insertions, yet it suffers from inherent imprecision. Here, we identify the DNA repair factor Artemis (DCLRE1C) as a key regulator of PEn-generated indel profiles, particularly in springRNA-mediated PRINS editing. Through a targeted genetic screen, we show that the absence of Artemis significantly shifts indel distributions away from deletions and shorter truncations towards longer, functionally acceptable insertions. Our data indicates that Artemis cleaves PEn-generated 3'-overhangs in a length-dependent manner, with its impact increasing for longer reverse-transcribed overhangs. This understanding reveals that regulating Artemis activity can improve insertion frequency specifically for PRINS. We develop and validate robust epigenetic (CRISPRoff) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) strategies to effectively silence/knockdown Artemis expression, successfully recapitulating the beneficial PRINS editing outcomes observed in Artemis-deficient cells. Leveraging these insights, we show that Artemis modulation can enhance endogenous protein tagging in cells, including challenging hiPSC-derived non-dividing cardiomyocytes.

The hippocampus is a region of the brain that is essential for the formation of episodic and spatial memories, which are particularly susceptible to age-related decline. In this perspective manuscript, we have used mass spectrometry as an unbiased method to profile histone tail post-translational modifications both at baseline and after contextual fear conditioning (CFC) from young and aged mouse hippocampi to identify age- and activity-dependent changes.

This study investigated the impact of two soy-based foods, soymilk-burkina (SMB), a traditional fermented Ghanaian beverage) and soymilk-millet blend (SMMB), on the gut microbiome of women of reproductive age. Methods: Fecal samples were collected from two cohorts of women consuming either SMB or SMMB soymilk-burkina or a soymilk-millet blend) at 2 weeks pre-intervention, baseline, during an 8-week intervention, and 4 weeks post-intervention. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to analyze the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome. Results: Beta-diversity analysis revealed no significant differences in overall community composition between the two cohorts. Alpha-diversity indices (Chao1, Shannon, Simpson) showed no significant differences in richness, evenness, or diversity between cohorts, suggesting a balanced gut ecosystem after both interventions. However, 20 dominant bacterial species were identified, including both beneficial (e.g., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bacteroides vulgatus) and potentially harmful (e.g., Eubacterium rectale and Bacteroides fragilis) taxa. Soymilk-burkina consumption of soymilk-burkina significantly reduced the abundance of Eubacterium rectale (associated with colon cancer) and increased the abundance of F. prausnitzii (beneficial), suggesting potential gut health benefits. However, these effects were transient, highlighting the need for sustained dietary interventions. Conclusion: This study provides insights into the dynamic interplay between diet and the gut microbiome, particularly in the context of traditional fermented foods such as soymilk-burkina. Although short-term changes were observed, the long-term benefits may require consistent consumption.

This strategy allows for the generation of specific, testable hypotheses about which cell types are important for a trait which can then be investigated in functional lab experiments for actual relevance. The success of this strategy strongly depends on the quality and systematic analysis of available single-cell RNAseq datasets.

Except TaP1xGW2A, the manipulated lines increased TGW over their WTs. However, only the transgenic TaExpA6 line reached higher grain yield (GY) than its WT, whereas increased TGW recorded by the triple knockout of TaGW2 was fully compensated by reduced spike number (SpN) and grain number per spike (GNS). Contrasting effects of TaExpA6 and TaGW2 lines were found on the ovary weight and floret dynamics, associated with the trade-off between GW and GN. Interestingly, the overexpression of TaExpA6 gene acts in grain tissues at post-anthesis avoiding the overlap with GN determination, while TaGW2 disruption constrains tillering, likely as a pleiotropic effect, and shifts intra-spike resource allocation promoting early ovary growth at the expense of distal floret development and GNS.

We jointly encode local field potentials (LFPs), single-unit firing rates, and a movement proxy into a time-aware autoregressive VAE (TN-VAE). In rats, pigs and humans undergoing controlled depth anesthesia experiments, the learned latent trajectories nonlinearly, but smoothly, separate four expert-defined states (awake, light, moderate, deep) at (2s) resolution, exceeding the temporal granularity of behavioral scoring (15m). The latent space supports linear readout of both coarse state and individual behavioral components, and its axes align with known physiology: delta/alpha power differentiates unconscious sub-states, while gamma and unit firing distinguish wakefulness. To enable cross-species use and incomplete modality sets, we add lightweight, species-specific stitching layers. This model pretrained on tri-modal rat data and fine-tuned with unimodal (LFP) pig data and unimodal human intraoperative data, successfully separates awake versus anesthetized states in new unseen human subjects, demonstrating zero-shot multi-subject transfer without per-patient calibration.

However, it remains unaddressed whether such false seeing is driven by older adults' elevated tendency to rely on context, or by age-related declines in visual perceptual processes. The current study addressed this issue by examining the lexical priming effects in 18 younger and 18 older adults (M = 21.4 years; M = 76.2 years) in Experiment 1, and 13 younger and 13 older adults (M = 21.2 years; M = 74.8 years) in Experiment 2 using a two-alternative, forced-choice (2AFC) paradigm, while controlling for age-related perceptual differences.

We applied Signal Detection Theory to isolate perceptual sensitivity and response bias. Results revealed that once stimulus parameters were adjusted to eliminate age-differences in performance when the prime was unrelated to the target, age-related differences in target identification in the related priming conditions were predominantly driven by age-related differences in response bias rather than in any residual age-differences in perceptual sensitivity.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Dominant theories propose that psychedelics increase the signal diversity and metastability of neural states, but whether this reflects a simple randomization of activity or a more structured reorganization is unknown. Here, we used high-density EEG (n=25) in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to delineate the effects of an ayahuasca-inspired formulation (intranasal N,N-DMT and buccal harmine) on the syntax of whole-brain functional states. Using microstate analysis, we show that psychedelic states induced by DMT and harmine are characterized by a profound acceleration of neural dynamics, evidenced by a reduced microstate duration and an increased frequency of state transitions. Despite that, the sequence of microstates became less random, as indicated by a higher first-order Markov statistic. This syntactic restructuring involved a systematic de-prioritization of transitions into one state (M2) and a corresponding increase in the prevalence and accessibility of two other states (M3 and M5). These findings reveal that the psychedelic state leads to a syntactically reconfigured state of heightened metastability. By showing that psychedelics both lead to an accelerated exploration of an expanded repertoire of neural states governed by increased syntactic structure, our findings improve our understanding of neural metastability in psychedelic states.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Since its first isolation in Malaysia in 1955, GETV has been reported in Eurasia and the South Pacific, yet documented cases in the United States remain exceptionally rare, leaving major gaps in regional vector competence and surveillance data. To evaluate the potential of local mosquito populations as GETV carriers, field collections were conducted in Montgomery and Pike Road neighborhoods of Alabama from 2023 to 2024, capturing multiple mosquito species for molecular screening. Initial real-time qPCR assays on 200 pooled and individual samples suggested that approximately 30% of specimens demonstrated possible GETV carriage potential. To validate viral presence, two distinct primer sets were designed to amplify viral genome fragments. Mosquito RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA, followed by nested conventional PCR. The first PCR, targeting ~280 bp, produced single or multiple amplicon bands in 32% of samples via gel electrophoresis. These positive cDNAs were re-amplified with a second primer pair targeting a ~430 bp fragment from a separate genomic region, yielding confirmatory bands in 30% of specimens. Amplified products were purified and Sanger sequenced, revealing approximately 95% nucleotide similarity to the wild-type GETV reference genome. This study delivers the first field-based molecular evidence supporting GETV detection in Alabama mosquitoes, signaling either localized emergence or potential introduction of the virus. These findings underscore the need for expanded vector competence profiling, arboviral surveillance, and livestock disease preparedness in the southeastern United States, strengthening both public health readiness and state-level vector monitoring strategies.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

In this study, I investigated the temporal variation in statistical procedures and the use of softwares used in studies on plant ant interactions. Data were collected from 142 published papers covering a period between 1979 to 2023. Information related to statistics terminology, the softwares cited and R software packages were retrieved. Each paper had on average eight statistical procedures and there was a significant increase in procedures over the years. The R software was cited in almost 80 percent of studies, surpassing by far the other softwares. Classical analyses such as t tests, correlations and chi-squares are still used in research; nonetheless, from 2012 onward a new set of analyses including GLM, GLMM and Networks have emerged and are being used as the leading analyses in studies of plant-ant interactions. This coincides with the adoption of R software by scientists in this field. The most used R packages were vegan, lme4 and bipartite, followed by several other related to linear (mixed) models. Statistics literacy is a mandatory aspect of research in plant ant interactions. The increase in statistical procedures over the years, as well as the emergence of new tests can be considered as a natural evolution of the field with demand for robustness in methods and analyses.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Since these frequencies are unobserved, exact inference of evolutionary parameters demands integrating over the full ensemble of possible frequency histories. This high-dimensional path integral is computationally prohibitive, and standard phylogenetic approaches avoid its evaluation by treating lineages as unconstrained birth-death processes. However, ignoring the carrying capacity comes at a cost: it necessitates an abundance of free parameters to describe simple allelic replicator dynamics and implicitly assumes an incorrect drift model. We propose a new approach by defining the fitness potential a dynamical quantity formally equivalent to the logarithm of reproductive value. By exploiting a duality between evolutionary dynamics and stochastic optimal control, we show that allows for the analytic marginalization of the unknown population history. This transformation yields a tractable likelihood function that strictly enforces competitive constraints while accounting for the information loss due to genetic drift in finite populations. We demonstrate that this framework enables parsimonious, site-specific inference of selection coefficients from phylogenetic trees. This dual-control framework shows ancestral lineages behave as optimal agents: they do not simply climb local fitness gradients, but \"anticipate\" future selection by navigating a global landscape of reproductive value.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Notably the asymmetry of this design approach results in an altered frequency response from the previously identified resonant point in the symmetric analogue. The crossover in the linker enhances the crystallinity of the sample by reducing extraplanar bending at the linker. Multimodal responses are identified in response to thermalization, while retaining the mechanical energy harvesting property, which suggests a bounded optimal formation temperature for crystallization of the metamaterial.

The widespread success of steric-block antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) for this purpose is, however, debated.

Two breeding populations were developed for this purpose, one based on marker-assisted introgression of the Pup1 locus into IR64, the second using a donor (DJ123) for internal P utilization efficiency and external P acquisition efficiency. Selection within these populations was conducted in fields managed according to local farmers practice without mineral fertilizer addition. Selected breeding lines underwent government-supervised variety release testing including farmer participatory evaluations in four Malagasy regions between 18-1350 masl altitude, and two lines were released as varieties FyVary32 and FyVary85. Both had between 0.47-0.8 t ha-1 higher grain yield than parent IR64 and local check X265. Yield advantages were stable across a range from 2.1-5.5 t ha-1 (national average: 2.8 t ha-1).

H2O2 acts as both a signaling molecule and a potential source of ROS depending on its accumulation in the peroxisome. Additionally, H2O2 can also drive non-enzymatic decarboxylation (NED) reactions as well as other decarboxylation reactions, leading to increased CO2 release that is linked to a severe growth phenotype. However, the exact cause of this stunted growth phenotype is not fully understood, and it remains unclear whether the capacity of catalase is critical for minimizing these decarboxylating reactions. Here we elucidate the mechanism behind the decrease in plant growth due to the accumulation of H2O2 from photorespiration using cat2 knock-out lines of Arabidopsis thaliana rescued with transgenic expression lines of Heliobacter pylori catalase. These experiments demonstrated that while one of the three heterologous lines expressing H. pylori catalase isoform (Hp615) had greater catalase activity than cat2-KO and rescued the severe growth and photosynthetic phenotype, its catalase activity was still far below wild type levels. These findings suggest that catalase plays a crucial role in maintaining H2O2 homeostasis within the peroxisome and minimizing decarboxylation reactions, both of which are linked to plant growth.

Continuous variation in GY, disease severity, and agronomic traits confirmed quantitative inheritance, with strong positive correlations between GY and ears per plant and negative correlations between MLN severity and yield.

Here, we examine sleep across the lifespan and its relationship to longevity in Drosophila melanogaster. We examined the associations between numerous components of sleep at different life stages to longevity. Early life sleep, but not middle and late-life sleep, was positively associated with longevity. Age-dependent changes in sleep were consistent but accelerated, when flies are housed under stressful conditions including nutrient and temperature stress. Further, pharmacological restoration of sleep in the first 10 days of life, but not at later time points, increases longevity. Together, this work provides a systematic investigation of how different components of sleep impact longevity and suggests early life sleep may be particularly important in promoting sleep across the lifespan.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated myeloid HDAC7 functions in obesity-driven metabolic disease. Methods: We used gain- and loss-of-function genetic approaches in mice to investigate myeloid HDAC7 functions in hepatic inflammation and metabolic disease, as well as associations with hepatic gene signatures characteristic of advanced chronic liver disease (CLD). Results: Transgenic expression of Hdac7 in myeloid cells increased liver inflammation and liver mRNA levels of Ccl2 and Il1b, key inflammatory mediators linked to CLD. Liver glycogen levels were also decreased, another feature of CLD. Transgenic expression of Hdac7 in myeloid cells mimicked the hepatic inflammatory phenotype that was observed in mice fed a high fat, high cholesterol, and high sucrose (HFHCHS) diet, an obesity model that mimics some features of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. In myeloid Hdac7 transgenic mice fed a HFHCHS diet, weight gain was increased, fasted glucose levels were elevated and glucose tolerance was dysregulated by comparison to control mice. Conversely, fasted blood glucose levels were reduced and glucose tolerance was improved in myeloid Hdac7-deleted mice on a HFHCHS diet. HDAC7 mRNA levels were also elevated in the livers of people with advanced CLD and spatial transcriptomics revealed that myeloid HDAC7 directs hepatic gene signatures characteristic of advanced CLD. Conclusion: Myeloid HDAC7 contributes to hepatic inflammation and systemic glucose dysregulation in a mouse model of obesity and liver inflammation.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

The biological significance of this diversity is not well understood. In mammals, transmembrane adenylyl cyclase 9 (AC9) is resistant to regulation by heterotrimeric G proteins. A major facet of this resistance is auto-inhibition - in the presence of activated Gs, AC9 is inhibited by its C-terminal domain. Here, we examined the natural evolution of this paradoxical control mechanism. At the primary sequence level, the hallmarks of auto-inhibition are apparent in all vertebrates, none are found in invertebrates. Teleost-specific genome duplication (TGD) resulted in two AC9 ohnologues one of which lacks the hallmarks of auto-inhibition. We cloned the cDNAs of the AC9 ohnologues of zebrafish and demonstrated the predicted difference in autoinhibition. The tissue distributions of the adcy9 genes of teleost species also point their subfunctionalization. Above all, auto-inhibited adcy9 is largely restricted to the brain indicating a fundamental role in brain development or function. Our findings document a quantum leap of the regulation of the enzymatic activity of AC9 in vertebrates and the potency of TGD to meet an adaptational challenge through functionally diversified ohnologues.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

We explored changes in mitochondrial plasticity in the three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), a temperate fish that in many populations has a single breeding season over which it produces multiple clutches and then dies. Wild-caught fish were exposed to one of three thermal regimes: remaining at 12C, switching to constant warm (21C) or diel cycling (12-21C) for three weeks at either the beginning or end of the season. We quantified both phosphorylating and non-ATP-producing (OXPHOS and LEAK) respiration in isolated muscle mitochondria, and oxidative control efficiency (OxCE). Early in the breeding season, young fish responded to elevated temperatures by adjusting both their capacity for ATP production and non-ATP-production respiration, but this mitochondrial plasticity declined over the season. OxCE was unaffected by time of season or temperature treatment. Changing body condition was unrelated to mitochondrial function. Our findings indicate that mitochondrial plasticity declines across adult life, potentially limiting thermal resilience in older individuals, the first time this has been reported in an ectotherm.

Recently diverged taxa provide ideal systems to test how target-site divergence modulates species sensitivity. Using whole-genome sequencing data from 573 mosquitoes representing six cryptic species of the Anopheles gambiae complex, we analyzed standing genetic variation across all 11 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit genes to establish a baseline for natural diversity before the large-scale deployment of nAChR-targeting insecticides in Africa. We detected no previously reported resistance alleles from agricultural pests and found no evidence of selective sweeps or loss-of-function mutations across the nAChR gene family. Patterns of polymorphism were consistent with strong purifying selection. Most nonsynonymous variants were rare, predicted to be tolerated by SIFT (score [&ge;] 0.05), present almost exclusively in heterozygotes, and occurred outside ligand-binding and transmembrane domains. However, the 6 subunit exhibited relaxed constraint, with two high-frequency substitutions (I198M and D202E) that defined haplotypes segregating by species. The derived alleles represented ancient polymorphisms, showed evidence of introgression, and were fixed in populations with reduced larval susceptibility to spinosad.

J.; Heron, M.; Ratcliff, W.", "abstract": "The evolution of reproductive specialization represents a fundamental innovation in multicellular life, yet the conditions favoring its evolution remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a population genetic framework that examines the fitness cost of reproductive specialization as a function of organism size. We show analytically that the costs of specialization decrease dramatically with organism size. For example, while a 4-cell organism with 50% somatic cells experiences a 50% reduction in population-level exponential growth rate (the same as the two-fold cost of sex), a hundred-cell organism faces only a 15% reduction, a thousand-cell organism 10%, a million-cell organism 5%, and a billion-cell organism merely 3.3%. This scaling relationship arises from the fact that proportionally more cellular growth in larger organisms is required for development, reducing the rate at which the fitness costs of specialization are compounded over multicellular generations. We contextualize our mathematical model with data from the volvocine green algae, showing that simple theoretical predictions closely match empirical measurements. While cellular differentiation demands that somatic advantages compensate for lost reproductive potential, we demonstrate that these compensatory requirements diminish with the logarithm of organism size, fundamentally altering the cost-benefit landscape for large organisms and potentially driving the evolution of a size-differentiation ratchet. This size-scaling relationship helps explain the broad association between large organismal size and multicellular complexity.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

By comparing observed frequencies of loss of function variants (LoFs) to those expected under mutation-selection balance we find that, for nearly all recessive genes, the observed frequencies are too low to be explained by purely recessive selection. Analyzing the effects of heterozygous LoFs on quantitative traits from the UK Biobank, we find that recessive disease genes have widespread quantitative effects in heterozygotes.

SRS causes large mortalities in Chilean aquaculture and leads to heavy usage of antibiotics. In Atlantic salmon SRS resistance is a polygenic trait with moderate to large heritability. In coho salmon a large QTL for SRS-resistance was earlier found on chromosome 21. In the present study we have further characterized genetic resistance to SRS in coho salmon and searched for putative candidate genes underlying the QTL. The mean heritability of survival was 0.31 and 0.58 on the observed and liability scale, respectively. The QTL on chromosome 21 explained from 26% to 97% of genetic variation within 12 different datasets. Two SNPs were substantially more significant compared to other SNPs and in very strong linkage disequilibrium with each other. The resistance allele was found to be dominant over the susceptibility allele at these SNPs. One of the two SNPs was located within the first exon of two genes which are transcribed in opposite directions: a histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 3 (hint3) gene and a gene (LOC109866666) encoding a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). Genotypes at the SNP were correlated with expression levels at both hint3 and the lncRNA gene, and the differential expression was manifested in both SRS-challenged and non-challenged fish. The exonic SNP is located 3 base pairs upstream of the start codon of the hint3 gene, at a position which is crucial for effective translation according to the rules of Kozak. The resistance allele at the SNP correlates to increased expression levels and increased translation levels at hint3, although the latter remains to be experimentally proven. Thus, it seems plausible that the QTL is due to the action of the hint3 gene and/or the gene lncRNA gene encoded by LOC109866666. The hint3 gene on chromosome 21 is different from homologs in Atlantic salmon, and no Atlantic salmon homologs of LOC109866666 were found.

We identified and validated 46 positive and 21 negative regulators of cell surface PrPC expression in undifferentiated CAD5 cells. Pathway analysis of the screening dataset showed that genes involved in the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and N-glycosylation biosynthetic pathways were overrepresented as positive regulators of cell surface PrPC.

We identified 23 core genes as shared between the undifferentiated and differentiated cell states, including many positive regulators involved in GPI anchor biosynthesis.

As a member of the multidrug/oligosaccharidyl-lipid/polysaccharide (MOP) transporter superfamily Rft1 resembles the bacterial MurJ Lipid II flippase which has an analogous substrate, but the mechanism by which it translocates M5-DLO is not known. Here we used AlphaFold3 and Chai1 to develop conformational models of yeast Rft1-M5-DLO complexes. The models suggest an alternating access transport mechanism with inward-open, occluded, and outward-facing states. A central cavity accommodates the hydrophilic M5-DLO head group, while the dolichol lipid tail is guided through a portal formed between transmembrane helices 1 and 8 to a hydrophobic groove outside the cavity. Comparative mutational analysis of cavity residues revealed a significant mechanistic divergence from MurJ which strictly relies on a conserved charged triad to anchor Lipid II via its pyrophosphate neck. Whereas mutations to these residues in MurJ result in total loss of function, Rft1 showed high tolerance to most charge inversion mutations in the central cavity when tested for function using a yeast reporter strain. This tolerance implies greater flexibility in Rft1's electrostatic requirements for engaging M5-DLO. Our findings suggest that Rft1 functions as a specialized, alternating access transporter for M5-DLO and identify key molecular determinants that are essential for function. The alternating access mechanism distinguishes Rft1 from all currently known scramblases which make use of a hydrophilic transmembrane groove to provide a pathway for lipid transit.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

To overcome this fundamental limitation, we apply the principle of division of labor to separate reproductive and metabolic tasks into distinct cell types within an isogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae culture. We introduce MiSTY (Microbial Stem Cell Technology in budding Yeast), a genetic platform that exploits natural asymmetric cues to control cell differentiation. Leveraging bud cell-specific transcription, a sequential series of recombinase-based genetic circuits generates Activated Stem Cells (ASCs) that divide asymmetrically into two cell types: bud cells that terminally differentiate into Factory Cells (FCs) and mother cells that remain self-renewing ASCs. Time-lapse microscopy demonstrated 100% differentiation fidelity across 97 cell divisions. Phenotypic and genotypic analyses showed that stem cell populations could be converted to over 95% FCs within 24 generations. By converting FCs into leucine auxotrophs, we inhibited FC proliferation while allowing continued ASC division, demonstrating complete uncoupling of cell growth from product synthesis. Because they continuously generate healthy new FCs, MiSTY cultures maintain high levels of productivity even under conditions that severely impair the growth and biosynthetic capacity of metabolically exhausted factory cells.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

A continuous belt of partially resolved lipids in the outer leaflet stabilizes the closed state, and the presence of lipids prevents the severing of subunit interfaces as the channel opens.

However, therapeutic targeting of LSD1 by competitive and noncompetitive inhibitors has yielded mixed results. Irreversible, enzymatic inhibition seems ineffective, but reversible noncompetitive inhibition has predominant off target mechanisms, leaving open the question of LSD1 function in Ewing sarcoma. Here we take a robust approach through multiple methods of depletion in multiple EwS cell lines to define enzymatic and nonenzymatic contributions of LSD1 to transcriptional regulation. We define a core set of 22 genes that are commonly repressed by LSD1 in all cell lines, and that repression of these genes downregulates synapse functioning and e-cadherin target genes. Derepression of these genes with LSD1 loss is an early and sustained genotype in all cell lines tested. We further define distinct gene sets in each cell line that are regulated by enzymatic and nonenzymatic LSD1 activity and find repression of e-cadherin target genes to be nonenzymatically regulated. This finding supports the growing body of evidence that in addition to their canonical catalytic activity, chromatin regulatory enzymes serve essential noncanonical roles as well. Furthermore, we uncovered evidence through use of the irreversible inhibitor OG-L002 that 2D cytotoxicity and proliferation assays may be insufficient to determine Ewing sarcoma response to LSD1 inhibition.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

However, the current understanding on regulation of callose accumulation under osmotic stress remains limited. In this study, we identify a novel role for CRK2 in regulating osmotic stress-induced callose deposition through controlling the availability of QSK1 at PD. We show that osmotic stress-induced enrichment of QSK1 at PD requires functional CRK2 and establish that phosphorylation of QSK1 at serines 621 and 626 is inhibitory for its enrichment at PD. QSK1 positively regulates stress-induced callose deposition in connection with its enrichment at PD. Live cell confocal microscopy and fluorescent lifetime imaging further reveal that CRK2 inhibits PD localization of QSK1 under normal growth conditions by phosphorylating and sequestering it to the general PM. We propose that following osmotic stress, dephosphorylation of QSK1 releases it from the complex, enabling it to relocalize to PD.

C.; Cabrera, J.", "abstract": "This study characterizes Penicillium melinii, an endophytic fungus isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana roots, as a plant growth-promoting fungus with potential use as a model to study root development and as a biostimulant for sustainable agriculture. Although endophytes are known to promote plant growth, the underlying molecular mechanisms often remain poorly understood. Here, we aimed to elucidate how P. melinii enhances root system development and to assess its applicability across different crops. Phenotypic assays were conducted in Arabidopsis, quinoa and tomato under in vitro, greenhouse and field conditions. Root architecture and biomass were quantified using image-based phenotyping. Transcriptomic and phytohormone profiling assessed plant responses, and fungal genome sequencing coupled with secretome analysis was used to identify candidate effectors and metabolic traits. P. melinii consistently promoted root growth and increased plant biomass across species and environments, both in vitro and in the greenhouse. In tomato field trials, this translated into a significant increase in yield. The fungus colonized root surfaces without vascular penetration and triggered a mild transcriptomic response: early activation of stress-response genes followed by their attenuation and sustained upregulation of auxin-related pathways. Notably, the interaction modulates the SLR-ARF-LBD pathway and the number of pre-branch sites probably through increased auxin signalling in the oscillation zone. Additional hormonal changes were limited and mainly associated with the attenuation of the plant response to microorganisms. P. melinii enhances lateral root formation through a subtle molecular and metabolic dialogue with the host plant, underscoring its relevance as a model for studying root developmental plasticity. Its strong and reproducible growth-promoting effect, demonstrated with different fungal strains and under controlled and field conditions, supports its potential as a biostimulant for sustainable crop production.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

The expression of all TaNAS genes was highest in roots and upregulated (apart from the TaNAS9 homoeologs) in response to hydroponic Fe deficiency. The TaNAS proteins ranged between 180 and 384 amino acids in length and showed variable N- and C-termini. To understand TaNAS function, we transformed bread wheat cv.

Current network inference tools reconstruct global networks from co-abundance data, which means they capture the overall correlation structure for the entire set of taxa considered. These approaches are computationally intensive and suboptimal when the focus is on the local neighborhood of specific taxa of interest.

APP transgenic (TG) mice with astrocyte-specific MAGL deletion (T-aKO), but not neuron-specific deletion (TG-nKO), exhibit markedly reduced A{beta} pathology, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation, along with preserved synaptic structure and function and improved cognition. These benefits are recapitulated in TG mice by AAV-mediated silencing of astrocytic MAGL, whereas MAGL overexpression accelerates neuropathology and exacerbates synaptic and cognitive deficits. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that dysregulated synapse-, inflammation-, and AD-related gene expression profiles are reversed in TG-aKO mice. MAGL expression is elevated in astrocytes from both AD patients and TG mice. Remarkably, a single intracerebroventricular injection of AAV-MAGL-shRNA administered at either presymptomatic or postsymptomatic stages prevents or reverses neuropathology and synaptic and cognitive impairments in TG mice, providing preclinical evidence that astrocytic MAGL silencing represents an effective therapeutic strategy for AD.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Through further investigation, we found that the extracellular field potential within the olfactory sensillum is regulated by octopaminergic neurons in response to the light stimulation and that rhodopsin 7 mediates the firing rate changes in the olfactory sensory neurons in response to field potential changes in a light-independent manner. Structural analysis suggests a voltage-dependent gating mechanism for rhodopsin 7 to respond to the field potential change.

Variants in DEPDC5 are associated with a range of focal epilepsies, including mosaic variants associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and other focal brain malformations with brain-only somatic mosaic variants. To investigate the role of DEPDC5 in human epilepsy related to mosaic variants, we have generated mosaic depdc5 loss-of-function zebrafish models using homology-based constructs acutely targeting depdc5 and labeled with tdTomato to allow for visualization of the degree of mosaicism. The resulting mosaic depdc5 CRISPants demonstrated early larval death, with ~50% of CRISPants (vs. 10% of controls) dead by 7 days post fertilization (dpf), analogous to the early death sometimes associated with human DEPDC5-related epilepsy. We compared depdc5 CRISPants with uninjected and scrambled controls from the same clutches. Body and head size were reduced in the depdc5 CRISPants. Analysis of swimming behavior showed a striking reduction in distance traveled and maximum velocity in the depdc5 CRISPants vs. controls. Based on visual confirmation of mutational load, we categorized CRISPants into depdc5+ vs. depdc5++, reflecting weak vs. strong tdTomato fluorescence. We observed that depdc5++ CRISPants had increased episodes of posture loss, suggesting increased seizure-like behavior related to higher percentages of mutant cells. Local field potential recordings revealed increased neuronal hyperexcitability in depdc5 CRISPants vs. controls. Acridine orange staining demonstrated early apoptosis in the CRISPants vs. controls.

With APOE4 broadly expressed in the brain, its cell-type-specific roles in AD pathogenesis are only beginning to be defined. Here, we show that neuronal APOE4 expression drives damaging lipid accumulation in hippocampal neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, with preferential buildup of peroxidized lipids in microglia in a tauopathy mouse model. Neuron-specific removal of APOE4 abolished this lipid phenotype, whereas neuron-specific expression of APOE4 was sufficient to recapitulate it, demonstrating that neuronal APOE4 is both necessary and sufficient for lipid accumulation. Strikingly, the association between lipid burden, microgliosis, and neurodegeneration was strongest in mice with neuron-specific APOE4 expression. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed neuronal APOE4-vulnerable neuron populations, as well as enrichment of disease-associated microglia and oligodendrocytes, all promoting lipid pathology. Primary mouse co-culture experiments showed that neuronal APOE4 drives microglial lipid accumulation via contact-dependent mechanisms involving uptake of lipids from neurons and oligodendrocytes.

Prior research has shown that the secretion of extracellular YRNAs (exYRNAs) changes in response to inflammatory stimuli. However, the mechanisms by which exYRNA packaging and dynamics in biofluids regulate inflammation remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that one YRNA species, RNY1, increased in airway fluid during allergen-induced lung inflammation and correlated with neutrophil infiltration. Using RNase sensitivity assays and size exclusion chromatography, we determined that RNY1 was present in airway fluid extracellular vesicles (EVs) and ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), while another YRNA species, RNY3, was present only in EVs. Both the EV and RNP-containing fractions of airway fluid had a unique ability to program cellular inflammation. Airway fluid EVs increased expression of an alternative activation program in macrophages including Arg1, Ym1, Il10, and Il6, while RNPs induced gene expression more consistent with a classic pro-inflammatory phenotype. RNY1 contributed to the programming of macrophages by airway EVs, as macrophages treated with EVs isolated from RNY1-/- mice demonstrated lower induction of Arg1 and Ym1.

However, it remains unclear how conclusions drawn from classical theoretical phenotype-fitness maps extend to models grounded in explicit biological mechanisms. Here we introduce weakest-link epistasis (WLE), a framework in which fitness is determined by the least-fit phenotypic component, an extreme form of diminishing returns epistasis. We show that in this framework, increasing dimensionality amplifies the load in a manner comparable to, but surprisingly not more than, Fisher geometric model (FGM). Building on this similarity, we demonstrate why genetic load is often invariant across different rules for combining trait-specific fitness components into an overall organismal fitness. We explore these ideas by considering the family of models where the organismal fitness is determined based on the Lp-norm of the vector of trait-specific fitness defects, a framework that includes both FGM and WLE, but also captures a continuum of genetic architectures, ranging from generalist to specialist regimes.

Previous research suggests that social isolation induces changes in gene expression that encode a starvation-like brain state and reduce sleep. However, the extent to which social isolation alters behaviors via sex-specific brain changes is unclear. Here, we use Drosophila melanogaster to explore sex differences in chronic social isolation-induced behavioral and transcriptomic changes. We focused on takeout (to), a gene encoding a putative juvenile hormone-binding protein, as a target that is upregulated solely in females following social isolation. Male and female adult flies were exposed to chronic social isolation, and multiple behavioral sex differences were identified through tests of activity, motivation, aggression, and sugar consumption. RNA-seq analysis also identified several candidate genes that were associated with sex differences in isolation-induced behavioral changes. Our findings suggest that social isolation is sufficiently stressful to reveal latent sex differences in behavior, despite having no impact on survival. To expression and sucrose consumption were upregulated exclusively in females following social isolation. Following to knockdown in to-expressing cells, sucrose consumption decreased in socially isolated females but increased in males. However, to knock down, to overexpression, and transformer knock down in neurons did not change sucrose-feeding behavior between control and isolated females. Overall, our results suggest that manipulating to expression influences sucrose-feeding in opposite directions between females and males following social isolation, and that isolation-induced to overexpression in non-neuronal cells in the brain or head may play a role in communicating information about females nutritional status to the brain. Additional roles for to in stress-related behaviors and behavioral sex differences should be explored, as well as whether to participates in signaling pathways that may be functionally conserved in human disorders.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

As neurons mature, these sites gradually shift from the shaft to dendritic spines. In fully developed excitatory neurons, the majority of glutamatergic postsynaptic sites containing the postsynaptic density (PSD) molecules reside on dendritic spines. However, some glutamatergic synapses remain as shaft synapses, yet their characteristics have remained unexplored. Here, we show that the molecular composition of the shaft PSDs closely resembles that of spine PSDs. Key components such as AMPARs, NMDARs, CaV1.2 channels, and F-actin interacting proteins, SynGAP, as well as cortactin, are present in comparable amounts in both synapse types. The major distinction between shaft and spine PSDs lies in the lower abundance of the scaffold proteins Shanks and Homer in shaft PSDs. Shaft synapses are not merely passive structures but actively participate in synaptic transmission. Their structure and function are modulated by changes in neuronal activity. Long-term live imaging combined with a cLTP protocol revealed that shaft PSDs were potentiated but rarely underwent a transition to spine synapses. In contrast, during LTD, shaft PSDs were eliminated more frequently than their spine counterparts. Together, these findings highlight excitatory shaft synapses as a distinct, and notably less stable, synapse type.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

We reveal an unexpected mechanism by which NKCC1 governs KCC2 membrane stability. NKCC1 clusters recruits SPAK and PP1 to dynamically trap KCC2, compensating for its lack of a direct SPAK-binding site. Single-particle tracking shows that these NKCC1-rich assemblies operate as signaling hubs, enabling either SPAK-driven KCC2 phosphorylation and its membrane destabilization or PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of SPAK and KCC2 membrane stabilization. Peptides that activate SPAK by engaging NKCC1 PP1-binding motif lower KCC2 surface levels and reduce chloride extrusion, whereas a SPAK-inhibiting peptide prevents SPAK recruitment to NKCC1, stabilizes KCC2 in membrane clusters, and enhances chloride extrusion. An optimized peptide analog preserves KCC2 clustering under hyperexcitable conditions, reduces seizure frequency and severity in PTZ-induced epilepsy, and suppresses ictal activity in human epileptic tissue. These findings identify NKCC1-KCC2 coupling as a central regulatory axis for inhibitory signaling, and position our peptides as promising therapeutic candidates to restore chloride homeostasis in epilepsy and other disorders marked by impaired KCC2 membrane stability.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we sought to determine whether this mechanism contributes to renal and systemic microvascular endothelial cell injury in sepsis-AKI. Sepsis-AKI was induced in mice by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection. Confocal microscopy demonstrated glomerular and peritubular eGlx damage, and increased circulating SDC4 demonstrated systemic eGlx shedding. These were associated with enhanced mRNA expression of eGlx components (syndecans 1 and 4) and endothelial inflammatory markers, Intercellular and Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecules (ICAM and VCAM) in the kidney. Additionally, sepsis-AKI markers, serum creatinine and urea, were increased. We found that renal and circulating MMP9, but not MMP2, levels were raised in sepsis-AKI. Moreover, MMP9 staining colocalises with neutrophil, endothelial and mesangial staining in glomeruli in sepsis-AKI. Treatment with MMP2 and 9 inhibitor 1, 1h before LPS injection, prevented glomerular, peritubular and systemic eGlx damage in sepsis-AKI. MMP inhibition also attenuated glomerular leucocyte numbers in sepsis-AKI. We confirmed increased MMP9 activity, shedding of eGlx syndecan 1 and elevated angiopoietin 2 levels, an endothelial damage marker, in sepsis-AKI in humans. Moreover, we used human glomerular endothelial cells (GEnC) in vitro to demonstrate that human sepsis-AKI serum directly damages GEnC eGlx.

However, the precision of this approach is often compromised by non-specific, \"leaky\" Cas9 activity that confounds phenotypic analysis and destabilizes Cas9/gRNA stocks. To address these limitations in Drosophila, we developed a toolkit based on the Anti-CRISPR (Acr) protein AcrIIA4. We first identified AcrIIA4 as a potent in vivo Cas9 inhibitor with high stability and established the temporal requirements for its function. Based on these findings, we generated three classes of Acr tools. First, a collection of AcrIIA4-bearing balancers robustly suppresses Cas9 and enables the stable maintenance of complex Cas9/gRNA stocks. Importantly, maternal deposition of AcrIIA4 from these balancers provides a means of temporal control, delaying Cas9 activity until metamorphosis. Second, tissue-specific AcrIIA4 transgenes refine leaky Cas9 drivers in a \"tissue-subtraction\" strategy. Finally, germline-specific and soma-specific Acr tools efficiently segregate Cas9 activity, solving bidirectional leakiness between these two compartments. This comprehensive AcrIIA4 toolkit provides new levels of precision, versatility, and temporal control for Drosophila CRISPR applications.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular have been successful in inferring natural selection, recombination rate estimation, introgression, dispersal distances, and effective population size changes. One limitation of CNNs and other deep learning methods is that they can be difficult to interpret. When they have been shown to be as or more successful than summary-statistic-based methods, what are they learning? Here we investigate CNNs from two different methods: the pg-gan discriminator for identifying real vs. simulated data, and two networks trained to detect selective sweeps. We first compute correlations between learned network features and traditional summary statistics, then assess whether summary statistics can be predicted from the learned features. To understand the learned features, we compute feature importance through SHAP values and feature groupings through dimensionality reduction. Finally we use decision trees and random forests to build an interpretable \"model-of-the-model\". Our results reveal that some CNN architectures can implicitly compute summary statistics such as pairwise heterozygosity, while statistics such as the site frequency spectrum are less similar to the network's learned features. We find that long-range linkage disequilibrium is readily approximated by the networks and may be more efficiently computed by CNNs than traditional methods (which are quadratic in the number of sites). Overall, this work contributes to the interpretability of deep learning methods in population genetics by clarifying the relationships between model architecture, learned network features, established summary statistics, and predicted evolutionary parameters.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Copula modeling offers a flexible approach to modeling gene coexpression by linking models of individual genes together using copula functions. Despite the growing popularity of copula models, their utility for modeling scRNA-seq data has not been thoroughly explored. Here we evaluated six copula models on their ability to model gene coexpression in scRNA-seq data. Using a diverse collection of reference datasets, we evaluated each copula model's accuracy and efficiency in reproducing gene coexpression patterns. Our results show that Gaussian copulas provide the best balance between accuracy and speed, with more flexible but expensive copula models providing only a marginal improvement in accuracy while requiring a much longer time to fit.

However, contemporary drug discovery is increasingly challenged by the high rate of rediscovering known molecules and the difficulty of activating \"silent\" biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) under standard laboratory conditions. To address this, bioprospecting in extreme environments, such as heavy metal-contaminated mine dumps, has emerged as a strategic approach to uncover strains with unique metabolic adaptations and chemically diverse natural products. This study reports the whole-genome sequencing, assembly, and comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of Streptomyces sp. Lv42-5, an extremotolerant strain isolated from the rhizosphere of birch trees (Betula pendula) growing on an industrial mine dump in Sheptytskyi, Ukraine. Genomic sequencing utilizing the Illumina platform followed by de novo assembly yielded a high-quality draft genome of 9.84 Mbp with a G+C content of 71%. Phylogenomic analysis using the GTDB and ANI calculation revealed that strain Lv42-5 shares only 93.36% ANI with its closest relative, Streptomyces diastatochromogenes. This value falls well below the 95-96% species delineation threshold, confirming Lv42-5 as a taxonomically novel species. Functional annotation via the RAST server indicated a genome heavily dedicated to metabolic processes, particularly amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, while lacking genes for motility and photosynthesis. Crucially, the genome encodes a robust genetic arsenal for heavy metal resistance, including specific mechanisms for tolerating copper, cobalt, zinc, and cadmium, reflecting the strain's successful adaptation to its metalliferous habitat. Genome mining using antiSMASH 8.1 uncovered a rich biosynthetic landscape comprising 43 putative gene clusters. These findings establish Streptomyces sp.

Although each of the five Ig-binding domains of SpA folds stably in isolation (as it is already known experimentally and also confidently predicted by AI models), here, we show that the full-length construct and the individual Ig-binding domains in the full-length construct fail to adopt a stable three-dimensional structure in solution (despite being predicted to be folded by AI models). Instead, full-length SpA populates a compact yet predominantly disordered ensemble with residual secondary structure, where the folded state of each Ig-binding domain is thermodynamically unfavorable.

Here, we show that VpChi1 exhibits markedly higher catalytic efficiency than a CBD-truncated mutant at low concentrations of crystalline chitin, while displaying substrate inhibition at higher concentrations. Single-molecule fluorescence imaging revealed that full-length VpChi1 binds selectively to the hydrophobic surface of crystalline chitin and remains associated for substantially longer than the truncated enzyme, indicating that the additional CBD stabilises the catalytic domain on the degradable surface. Kinetic simulations informed by experimentally determined dissociation constants further demonstrated that this extended residence time arises from CBD-assisted rebinding of the catalytic domain. High-speed atomic force microscopy confirmed that the CBD does not influence the velocity or moving distance of the catalytic domain along individual chitin crystals, suggesting that substrate inhibition results from CBD engagement with neighbouring crystals. Screening of seawater and marine sediments collected from multiple locations and depths identified Vibrio spp. and Pseudoalteromonas spp. as dominant chitin degraders, whereas terrestrial bacteria generally lacked the additional CBD. We propose that the dual-binding-domain architecture enhances retention on sparsely distributed crystalline chitin in aquatic environments, enabling sustained production of chitobiose, a known chemotactic signal for marine bacteria.

How epithelial cell shape is dynamically remodelled during phagocytosis while preserving tissue integrity has remained unclear. Using quantitative in vivo imaging of phagocyte-target interactions in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, we show that basal and apical epithelial domains are mechanically decoupled, enabling engulfment without disrupting tissue cohesion. Notably, the cell-cell adhesion receptor E-cadherin dynamically assembles into functional E-cadherin/catenin complexes on the basal epithelial surface upon apoptotic cell interactions. Targeted perturbations and semi-synthetic in vivo assays reveal two specific mechano-regulatory functions of the E-cadherin/catenin complex in phagocytosis: -catenin acts as a physical linker and transmits forces from the actin cytoskeleton required for engulfment, independently of E-cadherin trans-binding. p120-catenin recruitment further restrains Myosin II activity at the phagocytic synapse, which is essential for successful clearance. We also show that E-cadherin has a conserved role in apoptotic cell clearance by the trophectoderm in the early mouse embryo.

As cells exit the progenitor state and initiate lineage commitment, the cells undergo metabolic reorganization and engage a fully cyclic, Pdh- and Idh-dependent oxidative TCA cycle whose cataplerotic activity keeps the levels of TCA metabolites in check as their excess otherwise induces differentiation. Blocking these metabolic transitions disrupts progenitor homeostasis, compromises proliferative competency of transitional progenitors, and distorts balanced differentiation. These findings establish a developmentally regulated alternative to the traditional TCA cycle and reveals that appropriate engagement of modular versus cyclic TCA modes is required for orchestrating hematopoietic fate transitions.

Our findings place the U.S. outbreaks in a global framework and indicate that North American H5N1 may be predisposed to cross-species transmission.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Early menarche increases risk for breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, behavioral disorders, diabetes, and all-cause mortality. While genetic factors and higher body mass index (BMI) have been associated with earlier pubertal timing in girls, the effect of Native American genetic ancestry on menarche timing is virtually unknown. We assessed how individual Mapuche Native American genetic ancestry proportions and BMI changes over time influence age at menarche in a cohort of admixed girls with mainly European and Mapuche ancestries. We developed a novel joint statistical model that captures individual-specific BMI trajectory dynamics through individual random effects, linking longitudinal BMI patterns directly to early menarche risk, incorporating the assessment of genetic ancestry effects as well. Two parameter estimation methods were developed, confirming the robustness of the model fit. We found significant ancestry effects, with girls experiencing early menarche having higher mean Mapuche ancestry proportions (47.5% vs 45.1%, p=0.010). Each 10% increase in Mapuche ancestry substantially increased early menarche risk (gamma_1 = 3.405, p=0.010). Childhood BMI growth patterns strongly predicted early menarche: both BMI change rate (alpha_1 = 1.189, p<0.001) and growth acceleration (alpha_2 = 9.080, p=0.003) were significant predictors, while baseline BMI showed no association (p=0.254). These results demonstrate that higher Mapuche ancestry and accelerating BMI trajectories independently increase early menarche likelihood.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

It has been argued that biomechanical processes constrain motor displays and performing near the phenotypic boundary can be an honest indicator of quality. Using data from 140 blue tits Cyanistes caeruleus, including male and female songs, we found a new phenotypic boundary defined by a trade-off between song length and note length. Male song length competence, a composite metric considering the trade-off with note length, peaked seasonally during the female fertile period and was positively associated with reproductive success. These findings support song length competence as a fitness indicator in blue tits. Recovery competence, a well-known composite metric assessing the efficacy to produce consecutive notes, showed similar seasonal and reproductive variation but with a much smaller impact on reproductive success. We further confirmed previously known trade-offs between 2) frequency modulation vs. note length and 3) frequency jumps vs. inter-note gaps between notes, but these metrics seemed biologically irrelevant with no significant variation in relation to season or individual fitness. We encourage further research on birdsong and other animal displays to shed light on the universality of these principles in the assessment of motor performance.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

J.; Santocanale, C.", "abstract": "The coordinated activation of DNA replication origins is important for efficient DNA synthesis and genome stability. S-phase cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) together with CDC7 kinase, are essential to origin activation by converting the pre-replicative complex into a fully active helicase. To identify gens that tune DNA replication, we have performed a chemo-genetic genome-wide CRISPR-KO screen with cells challenged with the CDC7 inhibitor XL413. By developing a methodology based on genetic coessentiality to functionally cluster the hits, we uncover the transcriptional CDK8/CCNC in a cluster with replication initiation factors. We find that CDK8 depletion further reduces the rate of DNA synthesis imposed by CDC7 inhibitors. DNA fibre experiments provide compelling evidence that CDK8 and CDC7 cooperate in origin activation. Suppression of DNA synthesis by CDK8 inhibition requires the binding of CDK8/CCNC to the MDM2 Binding Protein (MTBP) and we show that CDC7 and CDK8 individually contribute to the phosphorylation of MCM4 subunit of the replicative helicase. Thus, this work identifies CDK8 as the third protein kinase directly involved in origin activation in human cells.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

E.; Tunc, H.; DURDAGI, S.", "abstract": "Structure-based docking often assumes a rigid receptor, obscuring induced-fit side-chain rearrangements that govern affinity and selectivity. We introduce DRGSCROLL, an open access docking platform and web server that jointly optimizes ligand pose and continuous receptor side-chain rotatable torsional angles within a genetic-algorithm (GA) optimizer. DRGSCROLL seeds broad-angle populations, evaluates candidates with a dual-objective fitness that rewards low interaction energy profile while penalizing steric clashes, and uses per-residue crossover plus stochastic mutation to maintain physically realistic angle sets. To favor exploration over premature local minima, per-iteration minimization is deliberately omitted; final poses are selected by clash-free filtering and RMSD-based clustering. Across PDBbind protein-ligand complexes, DRGSCROLL showed generation-wise decreases in clash counts and improved docking scores, indicating convergence to sterically viable, low-energy pocket conformations rarely accessed by rigid-receptor protocols. Relative to known publicly available and commercial docking programs such as Vina, Glide, and IFD; DRGSCROLL sampled more favorable energy distributions with lower median scores, consistent with superior induced-fit capture. In prospective virtual-screening evaluations, DRGSCROLL enhanced actives versus inactives discrimination for RET kinase and PARP1 targets, while maintaining balanced precision-recall trade-offs. Additionally, DRGSCROLL's endurance in differentiating actives from property-matched decoys was validated by benchmarking against a decoy database (Directory of Useful Decoys, DUDE), which showed improved AUC, recall, and enrichment performance in comparison to Vina GPU 2.1 under the same screening settings. By embedding continuous side-chain flexibility directly into the search, rather than relying on post hoc rotamer tweaks or heavy local minimization, DRGSCROLL addresses key combinatorial and feasibility bottlenecks in flexible docking. The method provides a scalable, physics-grounded route to adaptive receptor-ligand modeling that improves pose accuracy and early enrichment for flexible targets, from fragment screening to triage of synthetically ready or AI-generated small molecule libraries.

L.", "abstract": "Many biological processes, including cellular senescence, manifest as diverse phenotypes that vary across cell types and conditions. In the absence of single, definitive markers, researchers often rely on the expression of sets of genes to identify these complex states. However, there are multiple ways to summarise gene set expression into quantitative metrics (i.e., signatures), each with its own strengths and limitations, and we know of no consensual framework to systematically evaluate their performance across datasets. We therefore developed markeR (https://bioconductor.org/packages/markeR), an open-source, modular R package that evaluates gene sets as phenotypic markers using various scoring and enrichment-based approaches. markeR generates interpretable metrics and intuitive visualisations that enable benchmarking of gene signatures and exploration of their associations with chosen study variables. As a case study, we applied markeR to 9 published senescence-related gene sets across 25 RNA-seq datasets, covering 6 human cell types and 12 senescence-inducing conditions. There was wide variability in gene set performance, as some signatures (e.g., SenMayo) were robust senescence markers across contexts, while others (e.g., those from MSigDB), performed poorly as such. We also used markeR to analyse gene expression in 49 GTEx tissues, revealing tissue- and age-related differences in senescence-associated signals. Together, these findings emphasise the difficulty of characterising molecular phenotypes and demonstrate the potential of markeR in facilitating the systematic evaluation of gene sets in various biological contexts.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Substitution matrices are used in protein sequence alignment tasks. Since the introduction of BLOSUM62 over three decades ago, many matrices have been released.

Here, we define AFSM, the AlphaFold Substitution Matrix derived from over 20,000 predicted 3D structures following the BLOSUM methodology. We benchmark AFSM against BLOSUM62 and 16 other matrices on five tasks in multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and protein homology search. Our analysis surprisingly reveals that all matrices perform similarly. Only when there are few sequences in an MSA, then BLOSUM62 and AFSM perform better than using no matrix. This suggests that substitution matrices were most beneficial when there was little sequence data. We corroborate this argument by showing that embeddings, which are computed from billions of sequences, perform better than substitution matrices, when sequence data is sparse. Taken together this suggests that structural data does not improve BLOSUM62. But increased sequence data makes extrapolation with substitution matrices obsolete. Nonetheless, BLOSUM62 continues to capture chemists intuition on amino acids by providing numerical values implicitly reflecting physicochemical properties, and it remains indispensable for direct comparison of two sequences.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Chronic pancreatitis - a prolonged inflammatory state of the pancreas - is a risk factor for PDAC and is characterised by abundant fibroblasts. Thus, dissecting pancreatic fibroblast and epithelial cell reprogramming in malignancy relative to inflammation could inform new preventative, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for PDAC. Here, we studied how pancreatic malignancy and inflammation differently shape fibroblast heterogeneity and their crosstalk with epithelial cells. We analysed human samples and mouse models of pancreatitis and PDAC and leveraged new murine pancreatitis-derived epithelial organoids to establish pancreatitis and PDAC organoid/multi-stroma co-cultures comprising pancreatic stellate cells, fibroblasts and mesothelial cells. We demonstrate that a combination of in vitro and in vivo models better captures epithelial cell and fibroblast markers of human pancreatitis and PDAC compared to mouse models alone. Finally, we identify PDAC and pancreatitis epithelial cell-specific reprogramming of stromal cells of different origin, and we infer the contribution of these distinct stromal cell types to fibroblasts in PDAC and pancreatitis in vivo.

Hypernatremia and perinexal widening synergistically prolong cardiac APD in guinea pig. However, guinea pig lack the transient outward potassium current (Ito), which could be increased by hypernatremia and thereby shorten APD. Objective: Determine whether hypernatremia and perinexal expansion synergistically prolong APD in an animal model functionally expressing Ito. Methods: Whole-cell Ito was measured in isolated genetically-modified NavGOF ({Delta}KPQ) mouse ventricular myocytes. Ventricular APD at 30 (APD30) and 90 (APD90) percent repolarization were measured from optically mapped, Langendorff-perfused wild-type (WT) and {Delta}KPQ mouse hearts at different perfusate sodium concentrations (145 or 160mM), without and with the perinexal adhesion antagonist {beta}adp1. Results: In isolated myocytes, hypernatremia (160mM sodium) increased Ito. In whole-heart, hypernatremia significantly decreased both APD30 and APD90 in WT but only APD30 in {Delta}KPQ preparations. Perinexal disruption with {beta}adp1 did not change APD30 or APD90 in WT hearts, however it decreased APD30 and increased APD90 in {Delta}KPQ hearts. Combination of hypernatremia and {beta}adp1 did not synergistically change APD in {Delta}KPQ hearts. Computational models predict that Ito activation can prevent synergistic APD prolongation in mouse during hypernatremia and perinexal expansion that was observed previously in a guinea pig NavGOF model lacking Ito. Conclusions: Hypernatremia during NavGOF prevents early ventricular repolarization due to Ito activation (mouse) and prolongs repolarization in the absence of Ito (guinea pig). Future studies in animal models electrophysiologically similar to humans are needed to determine if hypernatremia and perinexal expansion are proarrhythmic during NavGOF.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

This study combined selective DG lesions with high-resolution recordings across the CA3 while rats explored environments that varied in contextual similarity. Global remapping in CA3 remained largely intact following DG lesion, but rate remapping was almost entirely abolished. Discrimination impairments were most pronounced in proximal CA3 and attenuated along the transverse axis toward distal CA3, paralleling the topography of mossy-fiber projections. These data support a hierarchical and mode-specific framework for pattern separation: the entorhinal cortex selects between global and rate remapping according to input dissimilarity, while the DG selectively enhances discrimination of similar inputs via rate-based modulation.

Our results revealed that aging profiles identified using our data-driven brain reserve model, which incorporated measures of cognition, neuroticism, and brain volume, achieved the highest validation results. Importantly, only two of the four aging profiles were characterized by the aging paradox (i.e., improved emotionality and decreased cognition with age). We identified one profile characterized by particularly low levels of neuroticism and relative resilience to cognitive decline. Another profile benefited from relatively preserved brain volumes, potentially driven by younger ages and/or higher socioeconomic status. Conversely, we identified two profiles with poorer health characteristics, including one profile with elevated cardiovascular risk.

They evoke attention, arousal and sensory exploration and induce synaptic plasticity in brain regions related to learning and memory. Many of these effects have been attributed to novelty-evoked activation of the dopaminergic midbrain and dopamine (DA) release in major projection targets in the striatum. However, it remains controversial if individual DA neurons respond to novel stimuli. To address this question, we recorded and manipulated DA neurons in mice exposed to novel and familiar odors while monitoring orienting behaviors including exploratory sniffing, facial movements, and pupil dilation. We found that DA neurons were activated by orienting behaviors, rather than by novelty itself. Moreover, their activity was causally involved in generating the orienting responses. Finally, we identified a major input region to the dopaminergic midbrain which couples orienting to DA firing. Activity in the mediodorsal pons (mdPons) correlated tightly with sniffing and facial movements. Consequently, optogenetic stimulation of glutamatergic mdPons neurons induced both orienting and DA firing. Our findings suggest that DA neurons do not respond to novelty per se but are activated through descending glutamatergic projections from the mdPons. This mechanism links salient sensory events to DA release, providing a basis for novelty-evoked exploration and plasticity.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Achieving a singular social goal requires an extensive social brain network, of which computation is malleable and subject to modulation by diverse internal factors. However, how the brain leverages its internal state to navigate competing social goals is elusive. Here we show that the priority between competing instincts-social novelty versus sexual preference-exhibits a distinct circadian pattern. This is controlled by a two-component circuit linking the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a key brain region in the social brain network. Specifically, SCNVIP neurons project to Vipr2-expressing neurons within the thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE), which in turn projects to the mPFC to mediate this behavior. The function of Vipr2 in the RE is critical for shaping the circadian pattern of both appetitive and consummatory social behaviors. This allows higher social functions to be engaged in a timely manner, appropriately aligning prioritized social behaviors with the body's clock-regulated reproductive system. Overall, this SCN-RE-mPFC circuit provides a neural principle through which the master clock coordinates the prefrontal cortex to resolve a conflict of motivated behaviors by referencing an internal state.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Theories regarding its underlying mechanisms remain disputed, contributing to challenges in effectively treating the pain. In recent years, mathematical models grounded in the Bayesian inference framework have been used to describe various aspects of pain perception. However, pain is not only passively inferred but actively shaped through interactions with the environment--a dimension that classical Bayesian approaches typically do not capture. Because amputation disrupts both sensory input related to the limb and the ability to perform actions, a model incorporating both sensory and active components of pain may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying phantom limb pain. To this end, we developed a model within the active inference framework, which extends Bayesian inference to include action selection. The model provides a conceptual account of how loss of limb control, ambiguity in sensory input pertaining to limb position, residual noxious input, and preamputation pain may contribute to the emergence and persistence of phantom limb pain.

Here, we found that Arabidopsis thaliana endo-{beta}-mannosidase (AtEBM), a glycosidase involved in degrading vacuolar N-glycans released from glycoproteins, is selectively transported to the vacuole via autophagy. Further analyses revealed that AtEBM directly interacts with the core autophagy protein ATG8 through an ATG8-interacting motif (AIM). This interaction is essential for sequestering AtEBM into autophagosomes. Remarkably, the AIM is conserved among EBM orthologs across the green plant lineage. In addition, several phenotypic studies showed that atebm mutants generated through CRISPR-Cas9 editing did not exhibit autophagy defects, including early senescence and hypersensitivity to nutrient starvation, but rather had reduced fecundity.

Here we characterize the single Rhodnius prolixus VgR isoform and uncover an unexpected role in microbial regulation within the reproductive system. The receptor displays a conserved LDLR-like structure and is highly expressed in early oocytes. RNAi-mediated VgR silencing caused defective yolk granule biogenesis, leading to the accumulation of the main yolk protein precursors, Vg and RHBP, in the hemolymph, yet oviposition and fertilization proceeded normally. The resulting eggs were yolk-depleted and non-viable. Remarkably, VgR knockdown reduced bacterial 16S rRNA levels in oocytes while promoting the expansion of several members of the core virome, a phenotype not reproduced by Vg silencing. Neither purified Vg nor changes in immune (defensin) or RNA interference pathways explained the microbial shifts. These findings indicate that VgR governs not only yolk endocytosis but also the trafficking of microbial components into developing oocytes. We propose that VgR contributes to the linking of yolk endocytic dynamics and microbial homeostasis, influencing the balance of microbial components within developing oocytes. This connection broadens the functional scope of the VgR and provides new insight into how vertical transmission processes are shaped in this major Chagas disease vector.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Yet developmental mechanisms by which genes drive cell behaviors in building the final forms of such traits are rarely known. In this context, pigmentation is useful because colors and patterns often provide signals in mate choice, predation avoidance and other behaviors and pigmentation is unusually accessible to observation and manipulation. Here we focus on some of the most prominent signaling colors--red, orange and yellow--and show how BMP signaling at the cellular level allows for a very different kind of signal at the organismal level. Using pearl danio, Danio albolineatus, we find that spatially and temporally graded BMP signals promote development of yellow/orange xanthophores over red erythrophores in the fin of this species and a distantly related minnow, Tanichthys albonubes, and that conserved mechanisms, involving BMP co-receptor Rgmb, regulate differentiation of other pigment cell types in corresponding locations of zebrafish, D. rerio. We further use mutants of D. albolineatus with more red or more yellow cells than wild-type to demonstrate female responsiveness to carotenoid-based color differences between males in shoaling preference assays, and we show the existence of polygenic standing variation for this pigmentary trait. Our findings illustrate a chain of function spanning hierarchical levels and provide a deeper understanding of pigmentary form and function and its evolution.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we experimentally investigate how systematically controlled stimulus speed influences the temporal and spatial collective dynamics of Hemigrammus bleheri. Using a simple and customisable top-down projection setup, we displayed clockwise-rotating black-dot patterns at three distinct speeds to simulate complex environmental motion cues. We quantified individual temporal responsiveness through angular movements, and evaluated group-level spatial organisation. Fish angular movements positively tracked the rotation direction of the visual patterns. Lower stimulus speeds elicited predominantly exploratory behaviour, while higher speeds induced a transition to strong motion-tracking behaviour, aligning fish orientation with the rotating patterns. Increasing stimulus speed also corresponded with greater nearest-neighbour distance, indicating reduced spatial cohesion. Notably, we observed transient schooling episodes not aligned with the rotational stimulus, reflecting periods in which internal social interactions outweighed stimulus-driven coordination. Using a newly defined free-schooling index, we show that such internally driven episodes were frequent at lower stimulus speeds but markedly reduced at higher speeds. Overall, these results demonstrate that speed-controlled visual stimuli modulate both individual navigation and group coherence, offering new insights into how visual cues shape fish collective behaviour dynamics.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

G.; Rico-Guevara, A.", "abstract": "A substantial gap in dominance hierarchies research is understanding how such relationships change over time. Previous studies have generally used a single interaction matrix, assuming that dominance is temporally consistent. Yet food sources can be scarce and temporary, leading to changes in species frequency and assemblage composition. Hummingbird assemblages fluctuate as these tiny birds track seasonal floral resources, with individual movements affecting species composition. Artificial feeders, which may foster a greater number of aggressive interactions, provide a stable environment for studying dominance, unlike ephemeral and shifting wild resources. To assess the temporal stability of dominance relationships, we documented aggressive interactions in a hummingbird assemblage over three months on the western slope of the eastern Cordillera of Colombian Andes. We tracked local changes in species composition and visit frequency, recording interactions among 11 hummingbird species using high-speed cameras at three time scales: hour, day, and month. Dominance relationships and their certainty were analyzed through Perc analyses and interaction networks. Over three months of recording, and perusing over 27 hours of non continuous high-speed videos, we registered 3,907 aggressive interactions and 12,629 visits. Our results revealed substantial temporal variation in dominance relationships, species composition, and visit frequency, even within the constant food source that feeders provide. Dominance hierarchies were generally intransitive, with large species dominating, but also with smaller species occasionally winning interactions. We found high uncertainty in dominance relationships within shorter intervals with fewer interactions (e.g., hourly); and that rank changes between dominant species across months and days were linked to shifts in feeder visits. We recommend that future studies incorporate temporal variation, certainty analyses, and interaction networks to determine whether dominance relationships are stable enough to form reliable hierarchies and to explore the ecological significance of reversals in dominance and associated determinants.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Most modern novel isoform discovery methods function by identifying and assembling exon splice junctions from an RNAseq sample. However, splice junctions can only be accurately annotated with time-intensive dynamic programming alignment. This manuscript introduces KuPID, a method for preprocessing long RNAseq reads with the goal of better identifying novel isoform transcripts. KuPID utilizes kmer sketching as a pre-filter to quickly pseudo-align reads to known reference isoforms. Full alignment need only then be applied to reads that are most relevant to isoform discovery. Not only does KuPID speed up the discovery pipeline, it also increases downstream accuracy by filtering out extraneous reads. KuPID preprocessing simultaneously increases the f1 accuracy of isoform discovery pipelines by up to 16.7 points while decreasing the runtime by a factor of 2-3x.

C.", "abstract": "Synthetic condensates provide a way to engineer compartmentalized microenvironments that mimic the properties and functions of natural ones, yet the principles that govern their phase behavior and internal organization remain incompletely defined. Introducing charged residues into intrinsically disordered protein polymers (IDPPs) with LCST phase behavior typically suppresses phase separation under physiological conditions. Here we show that pairing two such oppositely charged IDPPs restores and programs LCST-driven liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), enabling a minimalist two-component platform for constructing synthetic condensates whose formation, size, and internal organization are encoded directly in sequence. LLPS emerges from an asymmetric, entropy-driven interplay between hydrophobic collapse, solvent reorganization, and salt-bridge topology. The balance between inter- and intrachain ionic pairing leads to distinct dense-phase microenvironments with tunable residual charge and micropolarity, thereby controlling condensate formation, and miscibility and the emergence of single-phase or multiphase protein condensates. The condensate interior further alters the ionization thermodynamics of charged residues shifting their apparent pKa and enabling tunable pH responses. Systems dominated by interchain salt bridges form low-polarity condensates that mix uniformly with hydrophobic partners, whereas molecular architectures favoring intrachain pairing retain residual charge and, in the presence of hydrophobic partners, undergo spontaneous internal demixing into multiphase assemblies. These findings establish a mechanistic, sequence-level framework for encoding phase behavior, micropolarity, and mesoscale organization in synthetic condensates, and demonstrate how minimalistic LCST-IDPP pairs can be engineered to create programmable microenvironments, opening avenues toward engineered condensates with higher-order organization and adaptive capabilities.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Obesity, which disproportionately affects AA/B men, is linked to increased PCa mortality, potentially through metabolic dysregulation. We hypothesize that methylglyoxal (MG), a reactive byproduct of glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism that is elevated in obesity, contributes to PCa progression. MG forms covalent adducts on DNA, RNA, and protein. We found that MG-adducts are elevated in AA/B men with PCa compared to EA men with PCa, as well as men without PCa. AA/B men with PCa had a higher frequency of SNP rs1049346 in glyoxalase 1 (GLO1), the primary MG detoxification enzyme. PCa cell lines from EA (C4-2) and AA/B (MDA-PCa-2b) men showed differential rs1049346 status, with C4-2 cells heterozygous and MDA-PCa-2b cells homozygous for the variant. This was associated with altered GLO1 expression and activity, with MDA-PCa-2b cells exhibiting reduced GLO1 function and increased MG-adducts compared to C4-2 cells. MG altered DNA repair and RNA processing pathways and induced distinct metabolic shifts in MDA-PCa-2b compared to C4-2 cells, including increased glycolysis and reduced oxidative phosphorylation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed unique MG-induced stress responses including a tenfold higher induction of TXNIP in MDA-PCa-2b vs. C4-2 cells, a gene inversely linked to GLO1 expression and activity. These findings suggest that MG stress may contribute to PCa progression in AA/B men through metabolic reprogramming and impaired detoxification, offering insight into potential precision medicine applications.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that targeting the epigenetic factor DNA methyltransferase 1 in endothelial cells (ECs) reduces angiogenesis while imparting profound changes to the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), including increased proportions of CD4+ memory T-cells and NK cells. Depleting CD4+ T-cells, or blocking lymphocyte egress from the lymph nodes with FTY720, rescues tumor growth in mice with conditional deletion of Dnmt1 in ECs (Dnmt1iECKO) and dramatically shortens overall survival, whereas NK cells are dispensable. Tumors implanted in Dnmt1iECKO mice show reduced vascular branching, elevated expression of Vcam1, increased vessel-associated T-cells, and a shift in vascular specification including increased proportions of immune-permissive post-capillary venules (PCVs) and interferon-stimulated ECs (IFN-ECs). Deleting Dnmt1 in EC cultures strikingly potentiates responses to combinations of IFNy; and TNFa; and, notably, up-regulates important T-cell co-stimulatory molecules for memory CD4+ T-cells, including Icosl, Cd40, and Tnfsf4. Finally, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) administered to Dnmt1iECKO mice with experimental melanoma lung metastasis reduces tumor burden, with some mice showing tumor eradication.

The subcellular origins of early cardiac injury remain unclear but cardiomyocyte (CM) mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated. However, vulnerability of specific CM mitochondrial subpopulations is unknown. Building on our previous work linking the postnatal maturation of crest-associated subsarcolemmal mitochondria (SSM) at the CM surface to diastolic function, we investigated the spatial and temporal susceptibility of SSM during DOX exposure and their contribution to early diastolic dysfunction. Methods and results: Adult male mice received chronic DOX treatment (5 mg/kg/week for 5 weeks) to mimic cumulative clinical exposure. Cardiac function was monitored longitudinally, during treatment and after protocol completion, using echocardiography-Doppler imaging, and global longitudinal strain (GLS). Subcellular mitochondrial remodeling was assessed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). A tamoxifen-inducible, CM-specific Ephrin-B1 knockout model was used to probe the functional role of SSM in DOX-induced injury. DOX induced a progressive and selective loss of crest/SSM at the CM surface very early within 3 days of exposure, while the architecture of interfibrillar mitochondria IFM remained preserved. This early SSM depletion paralleled impaired myocardial relaxation reflected by a prolonged isovolumic relaxation time, along with reduced GLS, all preceding changes in left ventricular ejection fraction or detectable IFM abnormalities. Notably, in mice lacking Ephrin-B1, and therefore mature crest/SSM, DOX exposure triggered an unusually rapid onset of systolic dysfunction, highlighting the cardioprotective role of these surface mitochondrial populations. Conclusions: Crest/SSM at the CM surface are the earliest selective mitochondrial targets of DOX, and their loss precedes IFM remodeling. This spatial-temporal hierarchy reveals a compartment-specific functional distinction, with SSM supporting diastolic performance and IFM sustaining systolic contraction. Hence, preserving SSM emerges as a promising early target to prevent progression of anthracycline cardiotoxicity toward systolic failure. Clinically, our findings also support early diastolic monitoring as a sensitive approach for detecting anthracycline cardiotoxicity.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Previous studies demonstrated the central contribution of estrogens which primarily influence liver biology through the activation of Estrogen Receptor alpha (ER). However, how ER signaling in hepatocyte modulates liver functions according to the nutritional status, a critical determinant of hepatic metabolism, remains to be characterized. The present study first reveals the nycthemeral expression profile of liver ER, which peaks during the feeding period (ZT16) in both male and female mice. ER expression is altered by reprogramming the hepatic circadian clock in response to inverted food intake, highlighting the influence of feeding on liver ER expression patterns. As ER is mainly expressed in hepatocytes both in human and mouse livers, the functional role of hepatocyte ER during fasting or feeding state was then delineated, using mice harboring ER hepatocyte-specific deletion (ERhep-/-) compared with their wild-type littermates (ERhep+/+). Transcriptomic analyses reveal significant sex differences in the adaptation of liver functions to this contrasted nutritional status, as well as the sex-specific regulatory effects of hepatocyte ER. In such physiological settings, hepatocyte ER deletion does not influence liver transcriptomic profiles in males but significantly alters gene expression in female livers, both fed and fasted conditions. Hepatocyte ER more specifically controls genes associated with inflammatory responses and fatty acid metabolic pathways in females, modulating the ChREBP and PPAR pathways in feeding or fasting states, respectively. Thus, hepatocyte ER is integral to liver metabolic adaptations to fasting and feeding in females but not in males, thus exhibiting both sex-specific and diet-dependent actions. Further characterizing sex differences in liver metabolic flexibility, these results provide new information to develop sex-based strategies for the prevention and management of MASLD.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Hence, this study aims to capture neural drive in the tibialis anterior, in particular motor unit recruitment thresholds and rate coding, and the corresponding changes in energy use across a range of mechanical demands. Fixed ankle angle dorsiflexion contractions were performed at varying rates of torque development, while high density electromyography characterized motor unit spiking activity, B-mode ultrasound captured muscle fascicle dynamics, and indirect calorimetry measured energetic rates. Faster rates of torque development required earlier recruitment of motor units with increased motor unit firing rates which coincided with increased fascicle strain rates. At higher rates of torque development, these altered motor unit discharge patterns and muscle mechanics coincided with increased muscle energy use.

We identified twelve core salivary miRNAs-highly expressed and enriched in conserved target sites-that cooperatively target twenty-two human genes predominantly expressed in skin and neural tissues.

Current therapies provide symptomatic relief but do not restore lost neuronal function. Decades of clinical observations have reported the unexpected observation that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a standard treatment for refractory neuropsychiatric disorders, can incidentally alleviate motor symptoms in PD patients, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we report that in the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) mouse model of PD, two weeks of repeated ECT produced robust and sustained motor recovery, with improvements in locomotion and sensorimotor asymmetry persisting for at least 30 days post-treatment. Remarkably, ECT induced dopaminergic axonal sprouting from surviving dopaminergic neurons with cell bodies located at the substantia nigra-ventral tegmental border, leading to a partial recovery of striatal dopaminergic axonal reinnervation. In striatal direct pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs), which exhibit pathological hyperexcitability and spine loss following dopamine depletion, ECT normalized both corticostriatal synaptic responses and spine density. Consistently, ECT upregulated gene transcripts involved in cytoskeletal remodeling while downregulating those associated with glutamatergic signaling and neuronal excitability. These changes were accompanied by a coordinated transcriptional shift toward enhanced mitochondrial anabolic capacity and energy production, including increased expression of genes involved in ATP and Coenzyme Q biosynthesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that ECT can partially restore basal ganglia circuitry following dopamine depletion and provide a basis for further study of its potential as a noninvasive, disease-modifying intervention for PD.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

We show that acute and chronic pain activate distinct, spatially localized microdomains across multiple MTh subnuclei, including the central medial, interanteromedial, mediodorsal, and xiphoid nuclei. Activity-dependent tagging reveals a stable ensemble of nociceptive neurons that remains engaged across acute and chronic pain states, suggesting persistent thalamic encoding of affective nociception. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we find that most nociceptive-activated neurons express Oprm1, and that nearly all Oprm1 neurons are activated by nociceptive stimuli, identifying a pain-active, -opioid receptor-expressing population in MTh (MThMOR). Rabies-based tracing demonstrates that MThMOR neurons receive convergent inputs from nociceptive and inhibitory regions including the anterior cingulate cortex, periaqueductal gray, parabrachial nucleus, and habenula, while projecting broadly to cortical, subcortical, and brainstem structures involved in pain, arousal, and motivation.

BRAINMAP employs the Optimal Transport technique to correct distributional shifts across sliding windows and leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in conjunction with a hybrid approach that integrates an attention mechanism and the Mamba block to effectively capture spatiotemporal features for functional MR images. Finally, we introduce a novel Top-K sliding window feature selection algorithm to induce sparsity in dynamic FC. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our model for diagnosing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) using three resting-state fMRI datasets: ADHD-200, UCLA, and CNI-TLC, which comprise a total of 447 subjects with ADHD and 845 typically developing controls. Our architecture outperformed existing state-of-the-art dynamic FC models in ADHD detection, achieving improvements ranging from 3% to 12% across the three datasets. We demonstrate that our proposed model produces robust biomarkers, most notably the connection between the dorsal attention network and the visual network. Using an association study, we further establish the clinical relevance of the identified biomarkers.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Materials and Methods: Seven rats underwent dynamic 2D 1H-FID-MRSI during a 2-hour infusion of [6,6'-2H2] glucose. Consecutive 13-min acquisitions quantified Glx-C4 1H-signal decay, converted to 2H-Glx concentrations using baseline metabolite pool sizes. A three-pool kinetic model including 2H-label loss was fitted to regional turnover curves to estimate oxidative flux (Vgt) and pyruvate dilution (Kdil). Model performance and parameter robustness were finally assessed with Monte-Carlo simulations. Results: In vivo 2H-Glx turnover showed a saturated exponential rise (~60 min), with a labelling plateau higher in striatum (1.85 mol/g) than hippocampus (1.55 mol/g). Metabolic modelling provided region-specific oxidative fluxes: Vgt = 0.27 {+/-} 0.07 mol/g/min (hippocampus) and Vgt = 0.40 {+/-} 0.06 mol/g/min (striatum), with consistent Kdil across regions. Simulations confirmed a good model robustness in retrieving Vgt over a large range of experimental conditions.

Materials and Methods: 2D 1H-FID-MRSI were acquired in rats at 14.1T with three AD values (0.71, 0.94, 1.30 ms). Hippocampal metabolites were quantified using LCModel and AD-matched basis sets. Complementary Monte-Carlo simulations (n = 1000) replicated 1H-FID-MRSI spectra at multiple ADs under realistic SNR conditions. BLP was applied to in vivo and simulated FIDs to back-predict missing points up to AD = 0 ms, enabling quantification within a unified basis set framework. Results: In vivo and simulated data showed clear AD-dependent variations for several metabolites (Gln, tCho, tNAA, Ins, Tau), with discrepancies frequently >10% despite AD-specific basis sets. Simulations confirmed metabolite-specific biases increasing with AD. BLP reconstruction preserved quantification consistency up to 0.98 ms of recovered FIDs, reducing inter-AD mismatches in vivo - particularly for Tau, tNAA and tCho - lowering the mean discrepancy from 10.5% to approx. 5%. Discussion: These findings show that AD affects 1H-FID-MRSI quantification in LCModel, whereas BLP reconstruction can harmonize spectra across delays by enabling a virtual AD = 0 ms quantification scheme. This supports BLP as a practical strategy to improve consistency and comparability in MRSI studies.

In the human brain, the regional heterogeneity in structure-function (S-F) coupling is well characterized by measuring correlations between structural and functional connectivity. However, it remains unclear whether the same principles apply to the mouse cortex, where biological mechanisms can be studied directly. Here, we mapped S-F coupling across the mouse cortex by combining high-resolution structural connectivity derived from axonal tracing with resting-state functional connectivity measured by wide-field calcium imaging. Our findings revealed that structural connectivity imposes a robust yet regionally variable constraint on functional connectivity. As in humans, the S-F coupling was strong in primary sensorimotor areas and weaker in association areas, demonstrating a gradient from unimodal-to-transmodal cortical organization. This spatial variation covaried with intrinsic cellular properties, including myelination, excitation-inhibition balance, synaptic density, and gene expression profiles, but did not align with the anatomically defined cortical hierarchy. Our findings highlight graded S-F coupling as a common organizational principle in both the mouse and human cortex, providing a framework for future mechanistic studies using mouse models.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

S.; Treier, M.", "abstract": "Mammalian circadian organisation is orchestrated by a light entrained master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and SCN independent, food and metabolism responsive oscillators in the brain and periphery; feeding can entrain these systems, enabling anticipation of feeding time. Here, we show that a human missense variant (Q159K) in the homeodomain of the brain specific transcription factor BSX causes profound loss of circadian behavioural rhythms and food anticipatory activity (FAA) in mice. Whole brain imaging reveals failure of the compact dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMHc) to form and the absence of histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus (TMN) in BsxQ159K/Q159K mice. Consequently, under light-dark (LD) and constant darkness (DD), sleep-wake cycles and circadian locomotor rhythmicity are profoundly lost, whereas total wake time and spontaneous locomotor activity are preserved, with daily caloric intake substantially shifted from the dark to the light cycle. Therefore, in DD, metabolic recordings reveal a rhythmic respiratory exchange ratio (RER) pattern that differs substantially from that of wild-type mice and is markedly attenuated under LD conditions. In addition, BsxQ159K/Q159K mice lack FAA during restricted feeding and fail to increase locomotor activity upon food deprivation. Despite the loss of circadian behavioural rhythms and altered daily feeding behaviour, BsxQ159K/Q159K mice maintain metabolic homeostasis, a lean body composition into advanced age, and a normal lifespan under ad libitum feeding and controlled LD. These findings provide genetic evidence that circadian organization is not universally required for metabolic homeostasis, suggesting instead that circadian rhythmicity is an adaptive feature advantageous primarily under diurnal conditions.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

These limitations have caused family-level taxonomic confusion and ambiguous Clostridioides genus boundaries, hindering clinical identification of pathogenic strains and posing public health risks. To address these limitations, we developed an integrated approach combining multi-scale phylogenomic and protein-based molecular evidence, adopting a hierarchical workflow: first, constructing a 16S rRNA phylogeny of 151 Firmicutes strains to demonstrate traditional marker inadequacies; second, generating a whole-genome protein phylogeny of 51 representative Peptostreptococcaceae genomes and defining taxonomic boundaries via Average Amino Acid Identity (AAI); third, analyzing spore-associated protein patterns across C. difficile isolates and related genomes. Results revealed high conservation of C. difficile spore coat/exosporium proteins and clear genus-level phylogenetic distinctiveness of these proteins. Combined with AAI-validated whole-genome data, our findings support key Peptostreptococcaceae taxonomic revisions: redefining polyphyletic Romboutsia, reassigning Eubacterium tenue to Paeniclostridium, and elevating Alkalithermobacter to genus status.

The ankle-brachial index is one of the most used measurements to assess a reduction in blood flow to the foot, but it is not able to characterise tissue perfusion. Information on tissue perfusion can be obtained, among others, through an MRI scan, which is time-consuming and can be painful if induction of ischemia is warranted for the scan. As an alternative, we model foot perfusion during a cuff-induced ischaemia test to characterise how occlusions in foot arteries affect perfusion in foot regions. Simulations are not patient-specific at this stage, and are conducted on a 1D arterial network model which includes 154 foot and calf arterial segments, providing a realistic description of the topology of the foot arterial vasculature. A baseline model characterizes perfusion in angiosomes under healthy conditions, which is then modified to reflect 42 pathological scenarios by introducing occlusions and different levels of collateral impairment. Results show a marked influence of collateral impairment on angiosome perfusion under the condition of a single-artery occlusion, highlighting the role of blood redistribution. If two feeding arteries are occluded, perfusion markedly decreases at all collateral impairment levels due to the severe reduction in incoming blood flow. These results provide a bridge between the angiosome-targeted and \"best-vessel\" strategies for revascularization, showing that both can be correct depending on collateral sufficiency.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

The local hemodynamic environment during the formation of the thrombus influences its final composition, which in turn influences its mechanical characteristics and the associated risk of embolization. However, how arterial shear rates determine the local mechanical properties, structure and composition of clots remains poorly understood. Objective: To investigate how physiological and pathological arterial shear rates shape blood clot composition, formation dynamics, and regional mechanical properties in a newly-developed microfluidic flow model. Methods: We used a microfluidic flow model that allows real-time imaging of blood clot formation under controlled arterial shear rates (300, 1000, and 3500s-1). We visualized platelets and fibrin deposition using confocal microscopy and quantified composition-dependent spatial heterogeneities in clot stiffness with microindentation. Results: Pathologically high (3500 s-1) arterial shear rates promoted more rapid platelet aggregation and the formation of taller platelet-rich clots. Fibrin deposition started after about 6 minutes in all shear conditions and coincided with platelet aggregate stabilization at higher shear rates. Microindentation revealed that platelet- and fibrin-rich regions were significantly stiffer than red blood cell-rich regions. Clots formed at 3500 s-1 had a > 3-fold higher average stiffness than those formed at 300s-1, reflecting their higher platelet content. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that arterial shear rate governs clot growth and composition, translating into shear-dependent microscale mechanical properties. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into clot properties that are relevant for clot stability and vulnerability to embolization.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

In this study both synthetic and experimental single-cell CRISPR perturbation data is leveraged, and a suite of causal structure learning algorithms, is evaluated on metrics tailored to synthetic ground truth and real biological data respectively. On synthetic data, accurate recovery of GRNs is achieved under favourable conditions: strong interventions, large sample sizes, and low measurement noise. However, on real data, performance remains unreliable, limited by technical and biological noise, as well as algorithmic scalability. This highlights a current gap between theoretical potential and practical application of causal structure learning for GRNs.

Using cryo-electron tomography, we compared Gag-only virus-like particles (VLPs) with immature HIV-1 virions and found that VLPs assemble denser and more complete lattices, exhibiting a strong correlation between lattice curvature and Gag copy number. In contrast, immature virions incorporate fewer Gag molecules and display weaker coupling between curvature and Gag stoichiometry.

We have previously shown that invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation is cell cycle-dependent. In mesenchymal human breast cancer cells, invadopodia degrade predominantly in G1 phase of the cell cycle. More recently, we have discovered that the hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) metastatic cells also have the ability to assemble invadopodia. Here, we investigated how different EMT states affect the cell cycle regulation of invadopodia and invasion of breast cancer cells. Starting with the Early E/M cell line 4T1, we used TGFbeta-1 treatment to transition cells to a Late E/M state, or the induced Slug overexpression to achieve a fully mesenchymal (M) state, characterized by the complete loss of E-cadherin. We demonstrated that in Early E/M cells, invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation and invasion occur predominantly during the G2 phase, while Late E/M preferentially degrade ECM and invade during the G1, similarly to M cells. Moreover, when E cells are treated with TGFbeta-1, they transition to Early E/M state and degrade in G2 phase. To identify invadopodia components responsible for EMT- and cell cycle-dependent ECM degradation, we performed bulk mRNA sequencing of Early- versus Late- E/M cells in G1- or G2- phase of the cell cycle. The top candidate of our RNASeq analysis, FILIP1L, was expressed at significantly higher levels during G2 phase in Early E/M cells and during G1 phase in Late E/M cells, matching the invasive phase of each cell population. Expression of FILIP1L is upregulated in cells transitioning from E/M to M state. We next demonstrate FILIP1L is a novel invadopodia component, which colocalizes with Tks5 and cortactin. In the absence of FILIP1L expression, ECM degradation is significantly increased. Meanwhile, cell migration is significantly decreased, resulting in an overall decrease in the 3D spheroid invasion. Finally, we demonstrate that the expression of FILIP1L is associated with prognosis in breast cancer patients. In summary, FILIP1L is a novel invadopodia component which regulates breast cancer invasion and tumor progression in a cell cycle- and EMT-dependent manner by controlling invadopodia and motility of cancer cells.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Conditional deletion of Cd44 in CAFs in Cd44fl/fl;Pdgfrb;CreERT2 mice, significantly decreased the tumor volume.

Accumulating evidence suggests numerous roles of METTL3 in cancer initiation and progression and highlights the potential for targeting this enzyme in oncology. STC-15 is a potent and selective METTL3 inhibitor and the first RNA modifying enzyme inhibitor to enter human clinical development. It is structurally related to the previously published tool inhibitors STM2457 and STM3675. We previously identified the induction of a cancer cell-intrinsic interferon response following pharmacological inhibition of METTL3, leading to activation of T-cell-mediated anti-tumour response. Here, we profiled m6A levels at nucleotide resolution using GLORI and characterised RNA changes following METTL3 inhibition with STC-15 or STM3675. Following loss of m6A, we uncovered aberrant mRNA transcripts arising from intron retention (IR) and transcriptional run-on (RO) events downstream of m6A-enriched exons in human cancer cells and in tumour samples in vivo. We found that these IR and RO events produce double-stranded RNA and are bound by the cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor MDA5. Using preclinical in vitro and in vivo models, we characterised in detail the anti-tumour immune responses induced by STC-15. Our study reveals how METTL3 inhibition leads to dsRNA accumulation, which triggers a type I interferon response and induces anti-tumour immunity.

These structures are abundant in human PDAC, enriched for Tie2+; macrophages, and markedly reduced after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

L.; Ogbu, C.; Cai, M.; Bartlett, M. J.; Polt, R.; Nugent, F. S.", "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) often leads to long-lasting mood disorders and motivational deficits, significantly decreasing quality of life. The neuropeptide pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) has known neuroprotective effects and is often deficient in neurological conditions, but its role in preventing mTBI's long-term effects on mood circuits remains unclear. Our previous studies of repetitive closed-head mTBI in murine models found that the lateral habenula (LHb) is a key area for post-injury impairments. These impairments are characterized by mTBI-induced LHb hyperactivity and mood-related behavioral deficits. Here we investigated if a novel PACAP type I receptor (PAC1R) agonist, TES2320, could prevent or treat these long-term mTBI effects. The drug is based on a truncated glycoside analogue of PACAP that is stable and brain penetrant. Using RNAscope, we first found that mTBI caused a persistent and widespread reduction in PACAP mRNA within the LHb, suggesting a possible mTBI-related PACAP signaling deficiency in LHb circuits. We then used two intervention strategies in young adult male mice: an early intervention administered immediately after injury and a late intervention given as a single injection one-month post-injury. One month after injury, we measured LHb activity and self-care grooming motivation. Both early and late PAC1 agonist interventions almost completely normalized the mTBI-induced increases in LHb spontaneous tonic activity and hyperexcitability. However, only the early intervention improved the delayed initiation of grooming seen in mTBI mice. Unfortunately, a single late PAC1R agonist injection not only failed to reverse the grooming delay, but also significantly reduced total grooming behavior 24 hours after treatment. This finding points to a potential behavioral side effect of late PAC1R agonist administration on grooming. Overall, our findings confirm that an early PAC1R agonist intervention effectively prevents mTBI-induced LHb hyperactivity and associated motivational deficits, likely by restoring the persistent PACAP signaling deficiency in the LHb and its related circuits. This preclinical study provides strong evidence that novel PAC1R agonists could be a valuable preventive therapy for mTBI-related depression and anti-reward circuit dysfunction.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Myelin lipids and proteins undergo a slow turnover, but exactly how the multilamellar and compacted membrane sheaths are remodeled without compromising myelin sheath integrity has remained puzzling, in particular at advanced age when myelin abnormalities increase. Earlier EM studies had suggested myelin membranes are shed and subsequently phagocytosed by microglia. However, the formation of multilamellar myelinoid bodies (MBs), leaving a well-ordered myelin sheath behind, is difficult to reconcile with simple shedding mechanisms. Here, we show by three-dimensional FIB-SEM reconstructions of optic nerves in mice and by two-photon live-imaging of myelinated cortical slices that MBs are initially connected to their parental sheaths by long tethers, which are stretched by trogocytosing microglia and astrocytes. We observe ruptured tethers attached to both MBs and sheaths, suggesting a novel mechanism of tension-driven tether scission. Importantly, the successive fusion of the corresponding innermost myelin membranes in an extended tether can preserve myelin sheath integrity. Thus, the remodeling by tether-mediated MB extraction emerges as a mechanism of physiological maintenance of myelin sheaths in the CNS.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

We hypothesize that trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules such as neurexins (Nrxns) regulate the interactions of DA neuron axons with target cells and thereby influence axonal branching and synapse formation by DA neurons. We therefore examined neuronal survival, axonal growth and synapse formation in cultured DA neurons lacking all neurexins (DAT::NrxnsKO). Conditional deletion of all Nrxns in DA neurons revealed that loss of Nrxns does not disrupt the basic development of these neurons or the structure of their axonal terminals, including normal expression of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) and the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1).

During the respiratory health crisis in New Delhi in mid-November 2025 reported as an abrupt rise in symptoms/hospitalizations, clean air without masks is needed, both at home and on the go (e.g. work, school, shopping, exercising, traveling). Particle concentration data immediately before and during November as well as longitudinal time-series data (five years) suggest a sustained protection factor of 10x (90%) to 5x (80%) may be sufficient to revert particulate exposure to pre-November levels. Materials and Methods: A handheld 7-channel optical particle counter at 0.3 m (\"most penetrating particle size\") to 10 m was used in a Do-It-Yourself (DIY) manner to measure protection factor from smoke aerosols at 10 facial points at nose, eyes, mouth on mannequin head and an anemometer for airspeed at nose level. Three facially unobtrusive, maskless respirators (based on a US Patent # 12,343,573 B1) were prototyped and tested to for aerosol exposure in breathing/ocular zones without obstruction/occlusion of the horizontal and lower visual field to maintain forward and ground-visibility and enable eating/drinking. Each device was designed with off-the-shelf components to be mass-manufacturable: \"Air\" (442 g, 1 lb) used 1\" pleated MERV 13 filter, \"Pro\" (907 g, 2 lb) additionally used a flat MERV 13 filter in series, and \"Max\" (1162 g, 2 lb 10 oz) used two 1\" MERV 14 filters in series. Results: At nose, mouth, and eye levels, maskless prototypes measured 87-98% aerosol filtration at 0.3 m (2%-13% exposure), 94-99% at 1.0 m, and 95-99% at 5.0 m. At nose-level at 0.3 m, \"Air\" measured 87% at 118 ft/min (1.3 mph), \"Pro\" measured 94% at 78 ft/min (0.9 mph), \"Max\" measured 98% at 177 ft/min airspeed (2 mph), a 10x improvement over prior wearable, unobstructed maskless devices reporting approximately 60% (< 70%) of 0.3 m particles at nose level. Whereas in contrast to 0.3 m, at 1.0 m and 5.0 m, \"Air\" measured 95% and 98% respectively. Number of tests, averages, and standard deviations and for each datapoint are provided herein. Conclusions: The Do-It-Yourself (DIY) test method verifies indoor protection factor of 87%-97% for particulates at 0.3 m at nose, mouth, and eye level of mannequin using mass-manufacturable, facially unobstructed wearable devices without burdens of masks, and 95% filtration for at 1.0 m and 5.0 m. Personally verified devices permitted access to mannequin mouth and all-day wearable protection from airborne infection and pollution indoors (or outdoors without significant wind), verifiable on mannequin using DIY test method. \"Air\" demonstrated ~5x or ~80% at 0.3 m and ~20x or ~95% at 1.0 m and 5.0 m, while \"Pro\" and \"Max\" can reach higher protection, but not during windy conditions.

We provide support for the importance of microgel encapsulation for the emergence of niche-favorable MSC transcriptional profiles. We identify a common cell culture media that accommodates MSC activity while avoiding the use of serum that typically induces differentiation of HSCs.

It was previously reported in Marchantia nepalensis that carbon availability promotes gemma cup formation. However, the mechanisms by which carbon availability controls this process remains largely unexplored. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated how carbon promotes gemma cup formation using Marchantia polymorpha as a model species. Through a series of pharmacological and genetic experiments, we found that carbon availability promotes gemma cup formation by inducing the cytokinin pathway, thereby increasing the expression of MpGCAM1 and MpSTG, which encode two transcription factors involved in forming the basal floor of gemma cups. Indeed, our data show that cytokinins accumulate in marchantia thallus in response to sucrose and to high light treatments. In addition, constitutive induction of cytokinin signalling could overcome the repressive effect of low sucrose on gemma cup formation, whereas suppression of this hormonal pathway led to inhibition of sucrose-induced gemma cup formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that sucrose can induce gemma cup formation independently of KAI2A and MAX2, two molecular components of karrikin signalling known to control this developmental process by inducing cytokinin synthesis. Interestingly, in flowering plants, carbon availability also promotes cytokinin accumulation to induce axillary bud outgrowth, a process involving the transcription factors AtRAX and AtLOF1, the Arabidopsis thaliana orthologues of MpGCAM1 and MpSTG, respectively. Collectively, these observations indicate that the interactions between carbon and cytokinins are critical for the developmental plasticity of land plants in response to their environment.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Stomatal patterning therefore influences water use efficiency and is a target for engineering to avoid drought stress. However, there is limited understanding of how internal leaf anatomy is coordinated with stomatal development, in part due to the technical challenges of assessing three- dimensional anatomy with sufficient resolution. C4 grasses are understudied, and this is a significant knowledge gap given their file-like stomatal distribution and unique mesophyll organization. In this study, wild-type sorghum and a low-stomatal density transgenic line expressing a synthetic Epidermal Patterning Factor (EPFsyn) were studied. High-resolution microCT was paired with machine learning to characterize three-dimensional traits of mesophyll, epidermis, and airspace, which together determine gias. Sorghum internal leaf airspace is an arrangement of large sub-stomatal airspaces with thin air passageways. Adaxial and abaxial surfaces differed in stomatal patterning relative to mesophyll structures, sub-stomatal crypts and airspace CO2 conductance (gias). Surprisingly, adaxial stomata were consistently located above rather than between vascular bundles. Unexpectedly, gias was not significantly different in wild-type versus EPFsyn. EPFsyn plants had larger crypts and shifts in internal leaf anatomy, indicating a potential compensation mechanism for predicted impacts of reduced stomatal density on gias. These findings provide a new understanding of the interplay between leaf surface specific anatomy and internal structural patterning of the mesophyll in a C4 species, and provides knowledge relevant to engineering water use efficiency in crop species.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

The modular design allows rapid exchange of selection markers, epitope tags and reporters via Gateway cloning, providing broad adaptability across experimental settings. In addition to standard fluorescent and luminescent reporters, the system includes advanced sensors, such as FUCCI cell cycle reporters, to enable monitoring of cellular processes. By combining fluorescence barcoding with combinatorial genetic perturbations, the platform supports multiplexed analysis of gene function and genetic interactions through phenotypic characterization by multiplex fluorescence imaging or flow cytometry. We demonstrate its utility in vivo with breast cancer intraductal xenografts to reveal that ER+ breast cancer cells (MCF7) rely on androgen (AR), estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) for in vivo growth.

EZH2-catalyzed histone H3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me) in bulk was not overall significantly disrupted by this variant, in patient samples or cell lines expressing EZH2-L50S. EZH2-L50S protein is expressed similar to wild-type and can form PRC2. However, we find that specific genomic regions that normally have high wild-type levels of H3K27me3 are deficient in the L50S context, particularly around gene promoters. EZH2-L50S is still recruited to these sites, but is not as active. Using recombinant purified PRC2, we determine that L50S affects methylation of nucleosomes and disrupts allosteric stimulation that normally amplifies H3K27me3, consistent with the location of L50 in the allosteric regulatory region of PRC2. Thus, variation of EZH2 L50, occurring at low frequency in the population may interfere with normal B cell gene expression patterns, contributing to immunodeficiency.

Infection was analyzed by flow cytometry, infectious titers (TCID50/mL), RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. Goat and sheep MoDCs proved highly permissive to both virus strains, with viral titers at 48 hpi in the range of 104-105 TCID50/mL and a high percentage of infected cells, unlike bovine MoDCs, which were weakly infected and had no detectable viral titer, as expected for this dead-end host.

RdRps share a conserved core replicase structure described as a right hand within which RNA replication occurs.

Motif G, located at the RNA entry channel, guides the incoming RNA into the catalytic centre and and holds it in place during catalysis. Although RdRp phosphorylation has been reported, it has been scarcely studied. In most studied cases, phosphomimetic mutations reduced viral replication. In this study, we identified Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) polymerase (3Dpol) residues that undergo some extent of phosphorylation in infected cells. Among these residues, Thr109 and Ser110 located in motif G are highly conserved in the sequences of picornavirus polymerases and in the structure of many positive-stranded virus polymerases, including nsp12 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Using mutagenesis and reporter viruses, we show that phosphomimetic mutation of either residue abrogates viral replication, for both TMEV and SARS-CoV-2. Mutations of 3Dpol residues 109 and 110 into all other possible residues shows that, besides negatively charged phosphomimetic residues, bulky residues strongly inhibit replication, suggesting that phosphorylation inhibits polymerase activity by steric hindrance and/or through charge repulsion with RNA entering the catalytic core.

Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) may represent a more accessible source of tumor-reactive T cells. Here, we characterize the cellular composition as well as the transcriptional and functional properties of T cells from MPE compared with pulmonary metastasis and blood from a patient with melanoma. Methods: The immune cellular composition was immunophenotyped by high-dimensional flow cytometry from synchronously collected MPE, a lung metastasis, and blood from a patient with metastatic melanoma. Sorted CD3+ T cells were profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and T cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq). TCR reactivity to autologous tumor was evaluated through in vitro activation assays with TCR-transduced Jurkat and autologous cancer cells. The killing capacity of ex vivo expanded T cells of autologous cancer cells was assessed through in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Results: MPE had higher proportions of CD45+ immune cells and CD3+ T cells (70.5% vs 50%) compared with tumor and was enriched for effector CD8+ T cells, CCR7-CD45RA- effector memory CD4+ T cells, and quiescent CD25highCD127low regulatory CD4+ T cells. MPE T cells exhibited lower levels of co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1, LAG-3, TIGIT, TIM-3) expression relative to tumor. ScRNA-seq showed enrichment of NK-like effector CD8+ T cells in MPE.

The clonal repertoire of MPE and tumor highly overlapped, including 62.2% of predicted neoantigen-specific (NeoTCR) clonotypes. Notably, clonally-related NeoTCR T cells in MPE exhibited higher cytotoxic and stemness, and lower exhaustion signatures compared with sister clones in the tumor. Two of four selected NeoTCR clonotypes transduced in Jurkat cells demonstrated MHC class I-restricted reactivity in co-culture with autologous cancer cells. MPE T cells also readily expanded in the presence of high-dose IL-2 and demonstrated MHC class I-dependent killing of autologous cancer cells. Conclusions: MPE harbors polyclonal, tumor-reactive T cells with lower features of terminal exhaustion and higher cytotoxic potential relative to tumor T cells. MPE may therefore serve as a more accessible source for TIL therapy.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we combine novel signaling assays with quantitative microscopy to establish exosome secretion as a predominant and adaptable mechanism for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) dispersal. Introducing a novel synchronous release system to visualize Shh trafficking in embryonic tissues, we demonstrate that Shh traffics through the exosome biogenesis pathway in the limb bud mesenchyme. Shh-bound exosomes diffuse through the extracellular space, and can also bind and travel along cytonemes, providing a potential mechanism for directed and/or long-range transport. Using a synthetic patterning assay, we show that exosome secretion is essential to establish short-range Shh gradients in vitro. We propose that exosome-based Shh secretion, combined with different modes of extracellular transport, provides a tunable mechanism to sculpt Shh gradients on different length and time scales, across different embryonic tissues.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

However, experimental diets high in MAC also often contain estrogenic isoflavones, which may counter fiber beneficial effects by causing immunosuppression. Methods: We studied the effects of feeding female C57BL/6Tac mice low-MAC (AIN93G), low-MAC supplemented with isoflavone genistein, high-MAC (5V5M) or high-MAC isoflavone (high-MACi; 5058D) diet on their gut microbiome and response to anti-PD1 therapy against E0771 allografted triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-initiated estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) positive mammary tumors. We also determined whether blocking ER-alpha with tamoxifen (TAM) impacted responsiveness to anti-PD1 therapy in mice fed different diets. The effect of diet and treatments on immune cell signaling pathways was investigated using NanoString PanCancer Immune Profiling Panel. Results: High-MAC and high-MACi diets increased fecal microbial alpha-diversity and the abundances of SCFA producing families Lachnospiraceae, and Oscillospiraceae as well as fecal SCFA levels, compared with low-MAC diet. E0771 tumors responded to anti-PD1 in mice fed high-MAC, while mice fed high-MACi did not respond. Low-MAC fed mice with single E0771 allograft also responded to anti-PD1, but genistein supplementation eliminated responsiveness. E0771 tumors in high-MAC fed mice contained elevated levels of exhausted CD8 T cells, which were decreased after anti-PD1 therapy. Opposite effects were seen in mice fed high-MAC isoflavone diet. Mice with DMBA-initiated ER-alpha positive mammary tumors did not respond to anti-PD1. TAM converted TNBC and ER-alpha positive tumors to become sensitive to anti-PD1 therapy in mice fed high-MAC isoflavone or low-MAC diets, respectively. Genes in TH17 differentiation pathways were linked to TAM-induced improved anti-PD1 response both in TNBC and ER-alpha positive mammary tumors. Conclusions: Our results highlight the role of diet in impacting the effectiveness of ICB therapies. We found that increased SCFA levels alone are not predictive of response to anti-PD1, but if tumor expresses ER-alpha or if diet contains ER-alpha activating compounds, such as isoflavones, blocking ER-alpha might convert unresponsive tumors responsive to anti-PD1.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

N.; Li, T.", "abstract": "Background and Aims. Plasma cysteine has been positively linked to BMI in humans. Consistently, dietary cysteine restriction significantly decreases obesity in mice via mechanisms that are incompletely defined. Cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1) mediates the major cysteine catabolism pathway and is highly expressed in hepatocytes and adipocytes. The goal of this study is to determine the impact of this endogenous cysteine catabolism pathway on obesity and fatty liver disease. Methods. Diet-induced obesity and fatty liver disease were studied in hepatocyte-specific CDO1 knockout mice (L-CDO1-KO), hepatocyte-specific CDO1 transgenic mice (L-CDO1-Tg), adipocyte-specific CDO1 knockout mice (Ad-CDO1-KO), and adipocyte-specific CDO1 transgenic mice (Ad-CDO1-Tg). Results. Deletion of hepatocyte CDO1 decreased cysteine conversion to cysteine sulfinic acid, and had modest impact on liver cysteine, GSH, or taurine abundance. When fed a Western diet (WD), L-CDO1-KO mice showed elevated liver injury markers and inflammatory infiltration independent of obesity or steatosis. When fed a fibrogenic high fat/cholesterol/fructose diet (HFCFr), L-CDO1-KO mice developed worsened liver fibrosis. In contrast, L-CDO1-Tg mice fed WD showed lower blood glucose, but similar degree of obesity and steatosis compared to WT mice. Deletion of CDO1 in white and brown adipocytes of Ad-CDO1-KO mice had no effect on WD-induced obesity. In contrast, overexpression of CDO1 in white and brown adipocytes attenuated WD-induced obesity, which resulted in reduced hepatic steatosis. Conclusion. Genetic manipulation of intracellular cysteine catabolism in hepatocytes and adipocytes differentially modulates diet-induced obesity and fatty liver, which warrants future mechanistic investigation to better understand cellular cysteine sensing mechanisms and cysteine control of cell metabolism.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

It is well-studied in yeast and mammals but is less well understood in filamentous fungi. We previously identified TOR pathway components VTA (homologous to the vacuole-bound EGO complex of yeast) and GTR2 (homologous to Rag GTPases) as essential to maintaining circadian rhythms in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. Therefore we are interested in defining the TOR pathway and its regulation in N. crassa. In yeast and mammals, TOR kinase is activated by carbon sources and amino acids. We report here that on high glucose medium, TOR is insensitive to added amino acids. On low glucose, TOR is activated by added glucose and amino acids. VTA and GTR2 knockouts block the activation of TOR by amino acids but not by glucose, identifying their function in an amino acid-sensing pathway. Live cell microscopy of KOG1 (a component of TOR complex 1) and GTR2 localizes them to punctate bodies near the vacuole. This localization is lost and the proteins are largely cytoplasmic under starvation conditions, in the presence of TOR inhibitor Torin II, and in the VTA knockout. This indicates that VTA acts as the vacuolar anchor for activated TOR complex. Co-immunoprecipitation of KOG1-FLAG and GTR2-FLAG confirms their cytoplasmic localization in VTA knockout and identifies TORC1 complex components TCO89 and LST8. These results focus attention on amino acid sensing through VTA and GTR2 as potentially regulating circadian rhythmicity in N. crassa.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

The Hippo signaling co-transcription factor YAP1 promotes pCT maintenance and TSC stemness, however, how Hippo signaling is regulated remains unknown. We have identified a novel PRKCZ encoded aPKC isoform, aPKC-{zeta} III, that is highly expressed in pCT and ST. Here we establish that aPKC-{zeta} III promotes pCT fusion by regulating Hippo signaling.

Most models in this domain use transformer backbones, which require careful engineering of gene and expression encoding strategies, yet there is no consensus on which encoding techniques are effective. While benchmarking efforts up to date have focused on evaluating downstream applications using already pretrained models, we take a fundamentally different approach: we isolate different encoding paradigms and systematically compare them by training models from scratch under controlled conditions. Moreover, we scale pretraining to 10 million cells across 100 diverse datasets, a tenfold increase compared to similar studies. Through empirical experiments, we find that contrary to common assumptions, pretrained embeddings from large protein models like ESM-2 consistently underperformed task-specific learned embeddings.

Here, we identify the secreted metalloprotease gelatinase (GelE) and its regulator, the Fsr quorum sensing system, as key modulators of E. faecalis intracellular survival and replication. Mechanistically, Fsr quorum sensing is induced during intracellular replication, promoting GelE-dependent host cell lysis and bacterial egress. In the absence of active GelE, E. faecalis accumulates as large intracellular clusters, a phenotype observed consistently across GelE deficient wound isolates. In a mouse wound model, GelE deficient E. faecalis similarly exhibited higher intracellular numbers within wound infection-associated host cells.

This knowledge gap is critical given New Zealand's position along major migratory flyways spanning Oceania, Antarctica and east Asia, where understanding viral diversity is key to assessing the risk of viral introductions such as highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and viral dispersal across these regions. To address this, we conducted the first large-scale metatranscriptomic survey of wild birds from New Zealand and its subantarctic islands, collecting 1,348 samples from 31 host species spanning four avian orders. We identified 118 avian viruses from 17 families, including 107 novel species, greatly expanding our knowledge of avian viral diversity. Viral communities differed significantly by host order and foraging behaviour, with scavenger birds harbouring more diverse viromes than non-scavengers.

In this population, impaired immune function and increased intestinal barrier dysfunction contribute to a heightened susceptibility of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. Objective - To comprehensively characterise the gastrointestinal microbiome and antimicrobial resistance gene (ARG) landscape across the clinical spectrum of ACLD, and to identify microbial and resistome signatures associated with disease severity. Design - We employed long-read metagenomic sequencing (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to profile the gastrointestinal microbiome and resistome across distinct ACLD stages: acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), decompensated cirrhosis (DC), and stable cirrhosis, compared to healthy controls. Results - ACLF patients had pronounced levels of Enterococcus faecium, with six samples out of 28 showing over 95% relative abundance, suggesting its potential as a bacterial biomarker for advanced cirrhosis. We reconstructed 28 high-quality MAGs of E. faecium from cirrhosis patients, 17 of which originated from ACLF cases. This dominance of E. faecium correlated with substantially reduced microbial diversity and a marked depletion of key commensal taxa, including Blautia, Akkermansia, Faecalibacterium, and Bifidobacterium. Resistome analysis revealed significant enrichment of clinically relevant ARGs in DC and ACLF, including those conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and glycopeptides, correlating with prior antimicrobial exposure. Conclusion - Long-read metagenomics enables high-resolution characterisation of microbial and resistome dynamics across ACLD severities. By capturing taxonomic shifts, functional potential, and ARG enrichment, this approach provides valuable insights into microbiome trajectories linked with disease severity, informing mechanistic research and potential clinical interventions.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

One solution is the system of carbon capture and utilization (CCU), where C1 gases, such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), or methane, are either redirected from industrial off-gas streams or directly air-captured. A biotechnological process for CCU is the use of Methanothermobacter marburgensis for CO2 fixation and production of value-added compounds. In this study, we focused on valine production, an amino acid important for human or feed stock nutrition. We demonstrated overproduction of valine from CO2 in M. marburgensis with temperature-induced promoters. Here, we reached a 12.9-fold increase in valine production between the OFF- and ON states of the inducible promoter with a maximal specific production rate of 14.17 mg gCDW-1 h-1 of valine in closed batch experiments. In the second approach for valine production, we overexpressed acetolactate synthase genes with resistance to allosteric valine inhibition from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus recombinant in M. marburgensis. We identified a strong reduction in allosteric inhibition towards valine. This resulted in specific valine productivity of up to 40 mg gCDW-1 h-1 and states the highest specific productivity on an individual amino acid in methanogens. With those findings, we expanded the toolbox for genetic modification of M. marburgensis by a thermo-inducible promoter system and applied protein engineering for enhanced production of value-added compounds to M. marburgensis.

Although CRISPR technology has revolutionized the editing of nuclear genomes, it has not been successfully extended to mtDNA, primarily due to the challenge of delivering single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) across both outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Here we develop a survival-based reporter in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to screen for potential RNA import motifs. We identify a 40-nucleotide aptamer (IM83) that facilitates sgRNA entry into the mitochondrial matrix, enabling CRISPR editing by a mitochondrially-localized adenine base editor. We show that mitochondrial import of IM83 is ATP-dependent and enhanced by the tRNA synthetase Msk1.

AAV has a single-stranded DNA genome encapsulated in a 60-subunit icosahedral protein shell. Assembly of empty capsids occurs in the nucleus, and in a subsequent step, the genome is packaged by the motor activity of the AAV Rep proteins. The translocation of ssDNA has been suggested to occur through one of the twelve channels at the fivefold symmetry axis. While there is substantial evidence that Rep proteins directly interact with the capsid, the specific molecular determinants, stoichiometry, and translocation mechanism remain unknown. To understand how Rep proteins assemble on the capsid, we examined Rep-capsid complexes using cryo-electron microscopy with single-particle reconstruction. Our results show that Rep proteins can assemble into the capsid fivefold pore as either pentameric or hexameric rings. The different ring complexes dock into the pore similarly, using the post-sensor1 {beta}-hairpin motif (pos1{beta}h2) as a capsid interaction module. This interaction induces the folding of a segment in the capsid HI loop, resulting in an expansion of the pos1{beta}h2 {beta}-sheet.

In this study, we systematically analyze unassigned RNAs (uRNAs) across 14 public iST datasets and multiple technologies to characterize their nature and relevance in tissue biology. By assessing potential technical origins, in particular segmentation errors, noise, and diffusion across many tissues in both humans and mice, we find that around one third of uRNAs cannot be attributed to technical artifacts. Those non-technical uRNAs are enriched around cells with complex morphologies such as neurons, glia, and endothelial cells and reflect transcripts localized in cellular protrusions and extrasomatic compartments. Using these signals, we infer protrusion-associated transcript localization and identify cell-cell contacts beyond standard cell-centric segmentation. Our results challenge the assumption that uRNA is purely technical noise and instead highlight its potential biological relevance, particularly in relation to intracellular RNA localization and tissue architecture. To enable their systematic study, we introduce troutpy, a Python package for quantitative uRNA exploration in spatial transcriptomics data.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Unimeth employs a patch-based architecture and a three-phase training strategy, including pre-training, read-level fine-tuning, and site-level calibration, to fully leverage genome-wide methylation information. In comprehensive benchmarks involving 20 samples spanning 13 species, Unimeth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. This unified approach demonstrates superior accuracy and significantly reduced false positives across a wide range of scenarios, including the detection of both 5mC and 6mA, application in organisms from mammals and plants to bacteria, analysis of both wild-type and mutant samples, and use of both R10.4 and R9.4 pore chemistries.

Towards this goal, we previously reported Syn-F4, the first de novo enzyme capable of catalyzing a life-sustaining reaction, both in vitro and in vivo. Syn-F4 catalyzes hydrolysis of the siderophore, ferric enterobactin, thereby releasing iron and enabling growth in iron-limited media of an otherwise inviable {Delta}fes strain of Escherichia coli. Although Syn-F4 provides a direct enzymatic replacement of the natural ferric enterobactin esterase encoded by Fes, it has a dramatically different structure and enzymatic mechanism than the natural Fes enzyme. The novel Syn-F4 enzyme forms a 4-helix bundle, comprising a homodimer of two -helical hairpins. Here we describe the engineering of a covalent peptide linkage into the homodimer to generate a single chain 4-helix bundle. As expected, the resulting linked protein (Syn-F4-Link) also rescued {Delta}fes cells in iron-limited media. Moreover, X-ray crystallography revealed a 3D structure similar to the parental homodimer. Surprisingly, however, the linked protein was not enzymatically active. Instead, Syn-F4-Link rescues {Delta}fes cells by upregulating biosynthesis of the enterobactin siderophore thereby enabling assimilation of sufficient iron to sustain cell growth. These findings demonstrate that two very similar de novo proteins can sustain cell growth using dramatically different biological mechanisms.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

However, the function of type II SGNs remains poorly understood due to their scarcity and lack of clear physiological markers. In this study, we use two Cre-dependent fluorescent reporter mouse lines to enhance the identification and targeting of type II SGNs for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We reveal a set of distinguishing biophysical features, most notably, the presence of an inactivating potassium current and weaker voltage-gated sodium currents, that clearly separate type II SGNs from their type I counterparts. Additionally, we uncover greater-than-expected heterogeneity among type II SGNs, including variation in size, excitability, and ion channel expression. These features suggest the existence of distinct subtypes of type II SGNs, with potential differences in function. We find that most type II SGNs are relatively inexcitable and incapable of sustained firing. Instead, they appear to be better suited to integrating sustained signals, potentially supporting roles in detecting cochlear damage or modulating efferent feedback. Additionally, through computational modeling, we demonstrate that removing the inactivation component of the inactivating potassium current specific to type II SGNs allowed repetitive spiking to similar levels seen in type I SGNs, suggesting a crucial role for the current in stifling type II SGN activity. Together, our findings define biophysical signatures that distinguish SGN types and subtypes, offering new insight into their contributions to normal hearing and cochlear pathology.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

By systematically mining 871 putative drug metabolites produced by gut bacteria, we identified microbial drug metabolites with key physicochemical properties of prodrugs. Using bacterial culturing, a genetic gain-of-function screen coupled to mass spectrometry and comparative genomics, we uncover that Bacteroidota bacteria encode conserved methyltransferases that can generate prodrugs through carboxyl methylation. As a case in point, we demonstrate that bezafibrate gets converted to a prodrug by a distinct bacterial enzyme, increasing epithelial drug permeability in vitro and systemic drug exposure in vivo in a gnotobiotic mouse model.

C.", "abstract": "Successful viral infections reflect the balanced outcome of a tightly regulated program of viral gene expression and manipulation of the host cell environment to favor production of new infectious particles. The productive (lytic) replication cycle of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) is dependent on the essential transcription factor ICP4 encoded by one of five immediate-early genes. At different steps in the HSV-1 temporal cascade, ICP4 either positively or negatively regulates transcription of immediate-early, early, and late HSV-1 genes, largely through sequence-specific binding to cis-acting regulatory elements. In contrast, the direct regulation of host transcription by ICP4 is less well understood. In this study we exogenously expressed doxycycline-inducible wild-type and mutant ICP4 proteins in uninfected primary human fibroblasts and performed RNA-Seq to identify ICP4-driven changes to the host transcriptome. Cross-referencing our findings to a published dataset of ICP4-dependent changes to the host transcriptome in HSV-1 infected cells provided validation for a subset of differentially-expressed genes regulated by ICP4. Furthermore, disrupting the ICP4 DNA-binding domain was sufficient to alter the cellular gene transcriptional program responsive to ICP4. This indicates that the DNA-binding domain of ICP4, which is required for site-specific DNA binding to the virus genome, may also regulate binding to the host genome. Together, these data provide a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of how wild-type and mutant ICP4 expression impact cellular gene expression in uninfected cells.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

L.; Domitrovic, T.; Palhano, F.", "abstract": "Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells respond to heat shock by engaging multiple regulatory mechanisms that preserve proteostasis, including adjustments in transcription, translation, and mRNA metabolism. Although the transcriptional response to heat stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been well characterized, the extent to which translation efficiency (TE) is remodeled and how this remodeling contributes to protein synthesis remains less understood. Here, analysis of previously published ribosome profiling and RNA-seq data revealed that in S. cerevisiae, the TE varies during heat shock, depending on both temperature and stress duration. In contrast, TE remained largely stable in Escherichia coli under comparable conditions or during activation of {sigma}32, the main regulator of heat shock response in bacteria. In yeast, TE modulation patterns correlated with changes in protein abundance and differed markedly between early and late stages of stress. At 10 min, transcripts with short 5'UTRs and high codon optimality tended to display higher TE, primarily due to the easier ribosome engagement in these transcripts. By 30 min, the TE pattern across transcripts had changed drastically, suggesting increased availability of newly synthesized stress-response transcripts. These findings support a model in which early TE adjustments depend on intrinsic mRNA properties, whereas shifts in mRNA accessibility and transcriptional output shape later changes. The results highlight TE remodeling as a dynamic component of the heat-shock response in yeast and distinguish this behavior from the more buffered response observed in bacteria.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

J.; Barks, A. K.; Rao, R. B.; Georgieff, M. K.", "abstract": "Background: Anemia is a common medical condition in preterm infants. Previous studies show that neurodevelopmental outcomes of preterm infants are dependent in part on the degree of anemia. In a developmentally appropriately-timed neonatal mouse model, phlebotomy induced anemia (PIA) of the degree commonly seen in hospitalized preterm infants results in brain iron deficiency and hypoxia and significant short-term and long-term brain dysfunction, especially in the hippocampus. Iron and oxygen are critical for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation-mediated ATP production and thus energetically demanding brain developmental processes (e.g., axon/dendrite growth, myelination, synaptogenesis). Objective: To test the hypothesis that neonatal PIA acutely impairs mitochondrial respiratory capacity and electron transport chain (ETC) complex function in the developing hippocampus. Methods: Neonatal mice were phlebotomized daily beginning on postnatal day 3 (P3). On P14, mitochondria were isolated from the hippocampus of male and female PIA and non-bled mice. Seahorse bioenergetic analyses were performed to determine the effects of PIA on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation activity and ETC complex functional capacity. Results: PIA hippocampal mitochondria demonstrated an overall reduced oxygen consumption rate (OCR) compared to non-bled controls when ETC oxygen consumption was coupled to ATP production. PIA reduced hippocampal mitochondrial OCR that was not due to the ETC in females not males. Basal respiration, proton leak, and maximal respiratory capacity were significantly reduced in PIA hippocampal mitochondria, an effect that did not differ by sex. When mitochondrial ETC oxygen consumption was uncoupled from ATP production with the protonophore FCCP, a mild reduction in OCR was observed across all ETC complexes, with only complex I-mediated OCR being significantly lower than non-bled controls. Conclusions: These findings suggest that impaired mitochondrial energetic capacity may mechanistically contribute to the persistent neurobehavioral deficits caused by PIA, through dysregulation of energy-demanding neurodevelopmental processes (e.g., neuron structural maturation).", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Mutations in ELP1 underlie familial dysautonomia (FD), a disorder marked by sensory and autonomic neuropathy. While loss of Elp1 disrupts trigeminal ganglion formation and survival, the downstream molecular consequences remain poorly defined. Results: We performed quantitative proteomic profiling of trigeminal ganglia from Elp1 conditional knockout (CKO) and control embryos at E13.5. Across 5,650 detected proteins, 25 were significantly upregulated and 26 downregulated in Elp1 CKO embryos. EnrichR analysis revealed enrichment of upregulated proteins in amino acid transport and tRNA aminoacylation pathways, with links to neuromuscular and neuropathic diseases. Downregulated proteins were associated with RNA modification, cholesterol biosynthesis, and synaptic organization. Validation by immunohistochemistry confirmed decreased expression of the neurotrophic receptor Gfra3 and the neuropeptide Galanin, and increased levels of the chromatin regulator Chd1, in Elp1 CKO embryos relative to controls. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that Elp1 loss disrupts metabolic, RNA modification, and neurotrophic signaling pathways in the developing trigeminal ganglion.

Here, we present a haplotype-resolved, telomere-to-telomere (T2T) reference genome of I. pseudotinctoria, which represents the first complete genome within the genus Indigofera. By integrating PacBio HiFi sequencing, Oxford Nanopore ultra-long reads, and Hi-C chromatin conformation sequencing technologies, we successfully constructed two gap-free haplotypes assemblies (647.38 Mb and 657.52 Mb), characterized by high BUSCO completeness and QV scores, and fully captured all telomeric sequences. Comparative analysis between haplotypes revealed extensive synteny but notable structural heterozygosity but notable structural heterozygosity. Approximately 46% of structural variations overlap with genic or regulatory regions, leading to allele-specific expression divergence.

These scenarios encompass various classification and regression complexities, including variance differences, bimodal distributions, eXclusive-OR (XOR) interactions, concentric circles, and nonlinear relationships such as parabolic and sinusoidal functions. We tested several machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). We combined these models with diverse feature-importance methods such as Gini importance, accuracy decrease, SHAP values (Shapley Additive exPlanations), and Olden's method. We further applied significance-thresholding approaches, namely PIMP (Permutation IMPortance), mProbes, and the novel simThresh developed for this study. Additionally, we explored different dataset sizes to evaluate the scalability of these methods. Our analysis revealed substantial differences in computational demands, ranging from very rapid evaluations (e.g., DT combined with Gini importance and simThresh averaging 0.15 seconds) to extensive computations (e.g., MLP combined with SHAP and PIMP exceeding 7 hours). Among the tested combinations, RF/Accuracy/PIMP achieved the best overall performance, successfully identifying 59 out of 60 replicates in our benchmark study.

In doing so, it provides a deeper molecular insight into experimentally mapped networks by resolving communication trends across diverse conformational ensembles. The simulations recover the experimentally demonstrated thermal initiation loop and the Leu546-directed cone in SLO, exclude the negative-control Ser596, and explain the preference for Leu546 over Leu754 through shorter, more correlated helical pathways.

Since PHP.B was reported in 2016 to exhibit high BBB permeability in C57BL/6J mice, many BBB-penetrant capsids have been developed, yet their performance often varies substantially across species. From 2016 to 2025, we produced each newly reported BBB-penetrant capsid as its sequence became available and evaluated it under standardized intravenous administration conditions in marmosets. This included PHP.B, PHP.eB, AAV-F, CAP-B22, CAP-B10, CPP.16, CAP-Mac, and BR1N. Although several of these capsids have been reported to penetrate the marmoset BBB, none reproduced these effects under our unified evaluation conditions. We also pursued several directed-evolution approaches to engineer AAV9-based variants with improved BBB permeability; however, none surpassed AAV9. In 2025, VCAP-102 was reported as an AAV9-derived capsid with BBB permeability in mice and non-human primates. When evaluated using our standardized framework, VCAP-102 consistently mediated markedly stronger and more widespread whole-brain transduction than AAV9 across all three animals tested. These findings provide a decade-long, systematic assessment of BBB-penetrant AAV capsids in marmosets and identify VCAP-102 as a highly promising candidate for future systemically delivered AAV-based gene therapies.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Y.", "abstract": "Consistent individual differences in behavior (e.g., personality types, stress coping styles) are a common occurrence across animal taxa. One hypothesis poses that the resulting constraints for within-individual behavioral variation may also lead to constraints for the evolution of behavior. With stress coping styles seen across taxa, it suggests a common underlying proximate mechanism. In this study we investigated neural activity patterns across the brain by quantifying immediate early gene expression in individuals with alternative stress coping styles in response to an acute stressor in zebrafish (Danio rerio). While immediate early gene expression levels of individual brain regions in the aversive brain network were similar across groups, functional network activity differed. There were several differences across groups including interactions between the basolateral amygdala and hippocampal homologs. One brain area that had many different connections across groups was the central gray. There were many differences involving central gray activity between proactive and reactive fish at baseline suggesting that baseline activity may prime for the reaction to stress. Collectively, baseline brain activity can predict behaviors, suggesting that these differences in brain interactions at baseline may be important for biasing behavioral responses to stressors that characterizes a stress coping style.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

We constructed the first three-dimensional histological \"gold standard\" claustrum model, and systematically evaluated in vivo 7-Tesla MRI datasets against it and downsampled derivatives. MRI showed resolution-dependent differences rather than contrast limitations, transforming the claustrum's intricate sheet into an artefactually thickened ribbon. However, submillimetre MRI reliably recovered the dorsal \"core\" that contains most claustral volume and density and houses major corticoclaustral connectivity. At 0.5mm resolution, extension into the temporal lobe, including irregular ventral \"puddles\", was partially recovered, with uncertainty reflecting boundary imprecision rather than anatomical loss. Our results refute the view that the claustrum is inaccessible in the living human brain, define practical measurement limits, and provide a foundation for future functional investigations.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

A.; Ng, L.; Cui, L.; ZHANG, G.-Q.", "abstract": "The NIH BRAIN Initiative Cell Atlas Network (BICAN) is a collaborative effort among neuroscientists, computational biologists, and data scientists to create reference brain cell atlases to be used by the research community as a molecular and anatomical foundational framework for the study of human brain function and disorders. Coordinated sharing and management of the scarce human brain tissue, across lifespans and among the eleven participating BICAN centers and laboratories with anatomical precision, is a formidable undertaking. Creating and operating the necessary data production pipelines with de novo metadata standards prospectively established to adhere to the highest possible levels of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data principles, present unparalleled challenges that place BICAN into uncharted territories. A digital twin paradigm has been formulated and operationalized to manage advanced single-cell molecular techniques and complexity of data production workflows that are used in the BICAN consortium. The Neuroanatomy-anchored Information Management Platform (NIMP) implements the digital twin paradigm from conception to design, to production. NIMP is an agile, extensible, catalytic infrastructure for integrative and collaborative BICAN consortium-scale FAIR data generation. Digital-twin thinking ensures that NIPM provides tissue-to-bytes, end-to-end integration of data production pipelines spanning brain banks, laboratories, sequencing centers, and data archives. NIMP digital twin characteristics are manifested in the coupling of real-world workflows occurring in the BICAN laboratories with their digital counterparts moving progressively through verifiable provenance lineage paths. The implementation of NIMP digital twin features are grounded on advanced informatics strategies that include codification of anatomical contexts; standardized tissue request and sharing workflows, library preparation, sequencing, and single-cell omics data generation and deposition. These workflows and processes are governed by standardized Common Data Elements (CDEs); tracked by blockchain-inspired resource-identifiers (ID); ingested and edited using role-based access control (RBAC); and accessed by query-embedded dashboarding and atlas-enabled interactive resource exploration with dynamically rendered Sankey diagrams. In three years, NIMP has managed data and metadata for 762 human donors, 8,449 brain slabs, and 21,781 sequencing libraries across 11 laboratories, resulting in an estimated total of over 18 million cells for Basal Ganglia alone. The NIMP digital twin paradigm not only serves BICAN; it provides a blueprint for future-proof data coordination at consortium scale.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

J.; Isaacs, A.; Liang, B.; Schountz, T.; Chappell, K.; Young, P.; Modhiran, N.; Watterson, D.", "abstract": "Bats are natural reservoirs of viruses that cause severe disease in livestock and humans. Recent high-profile spillover events have directed significant attention towards the interplay between zoonotic viruses and antiviral immunity inherent to bats. Studies have highlighted that bats could harbour some deadly viruses without exhibiting outward symptoms. Various hypotheses have been proposed on how bats coexist with viruses; this includes dampened inflammation and altered innate immunity. However, there is limited literature on the humoral immune response in bats due to the scarcity of bat-specific reagents. To address this knowledge gap, we employed recombinant antibody design techniques to generate antigen-specific recombinant bat antibodies. This strategy involves combining the paratope of well-characterised antiviral antibodies with the IgG1 constant region of the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto). Characterisation of recombinant bat antibodies have revealed that they display canonical features of mammalian IgG. Additionally, recombinant bat antibodies display a binding and neutralising profile akin to human antibody counterparts. This approach provides much needed diagnostic tools and novel reagents to accelerate research into bat antibody immunity.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Here, we isolated six Candidatus Rickettsia mendelii strains from Ixodes turdus ticks in Japan. We obtained their whole-genome sequences, including one closed genome, and found that they form a distinct lineage in the AG and have the smallest genome among the known rickettsial species. Gene tree-aware reconstruction of evolutionary events using amalgamated likelihood estimation revealed that the last common ancestor of Rickettsia had a smaller gene family size than modern species do, and Ca. R. mendelii retains the most similar genomic content to this ancestral state. Various patterns of gene gain and loss among Rickettsia lineages were also suggested, highlighting their divergent evolutionary trajectories.

J.; Lirette, A.-O.; Greer, C. W.; Whyte, L. G.", "abstract": "Accelerated sea-ice decline is opening the Arctic to increased shipping, elevating the risk of marine fuel spills in fragile ecosystems where extreme cold and remoteness limit cleanup options. While microbial biodegradation is the primary removal mechanism, the metabolic strategies of abundant polar taxa remain poorly understood, particularly those lacking canonical degradation genes. We characterized the hydrocarbon degradation mechanisms of Flavobacterium sp. strain R2B_3I, a psychrotolerant isolate from high Arctic beach sediments in Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada. During three-month incubations with ultra low sulfur fuel oil at 4 {degrees}C, R2B_3I mounted a systems level response involving the upregulation of diverse non-canonical oxidoreductases, membrane remodeling systems, cold-shock, and oxidative stress defenses. Crucially, this strain achieved efficient degradation in the complete absence of alkB alkane hydroxylases, challenging the reliance on alkB as a universal biomarker for hydrocarbon biodegradation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct temporal shifts, linking specific gene clusters to the degradation of complex petroleum mixtures under environmentally relevant conditions. These results demonstrate that Flavobacterium, a dominant genus in polar oceans, utilize a ''cryptic'' metabolic network to process hydrocarbons, effectively bypassing the pathways typically monitored in environmental surveys. By uncovering alternative mechanisms, our study revises current models of microbial oil degradation, highlighting the overlooked potential of non-canonical degraders in determining the fate of marine fuel spills in a warming Arctic.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

To interpret such signals, ONT provides modification-aware basecalling models that estimate the probability of selected modifications at each nucleotide. In May 2025, ONT released updated modification-calling models (Dorado v5.2.0) for pseudouridine ({Psi}), inosine, m6A and m5C, alongside new models for 2'O-ribose-methylations, necessitating independent validation. Here, we benchmark Dorado v5.2.0 against v5.1.0 using ex cellulo tRNAs from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, leveraging their well-defined modification landscape. We generated modification probability profiles at single-nucleotide resolution and quantified model performance using curated sets of annotated and validated modification sites. Our results reveal that, despite notable improvements in {Psi} detection, most modification callers remain challenged by the dense and heterogeneous modification environments of tRNAs. This work provides the first comprehensive evaluation of Dorado v5.2.0 on native tRNAs and establishes a methodological framework for benchmarking future ONT modification models in complex RNA modification contexts.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

The transcription factor SOX2 is essential for sensory progenitor specification and hair cell differentiation, but its broader role in coordinating epithelial and neuronal development remains unclear. Here, we examined the consequences of conditional Sox2 deletion in the cochlear epithelium during prosensory development. Loss of Sox2 resulted in severe defects in peripheral axon projections and increased neuronal death within the spiral ganglion, indicating a non-cell-autonomous requirement for epithelial Sox2 in neuronal maintenance. Transcriptomic and chromatin profiling revealed that neurotrophic factors, including NTF3 and BDNF, are downstream targets of SOX2, suggesting that SOX2-dependent neurotrophin expression mediates epithelial-to-ganglionic signalling. These findings identify a transcriptional mechanism by which SOX2 coordinates the development of epithelial and neuronal compartments in the cochlea, revealing an unexpected regulatory link between sensory epithelium maturation and ganglion survival.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, by leveraging knowledge distilled from the foundation model and a dynamic supervised fine-tuning strategy, scProtoTransformer achieves robust biological representations with reduced pre-training requirements. Benchmark experiments across molecular, cell, and donor-level reference mapping demonstrate that scProtoTransformer delivers competitive or even superior performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches, while providing interpretability through biologically prototypes.

J.; Kirmaier, A.; Rudtner, L. M.; Pine, A.; Kirby, J. E.", "abstract": "Agar dilution is a reference susceptibility testing method uniquely or preferentially recommended for certain antimicrobials. However, the effort required to pour individual agar plates spanning a doubling dilution range precludes its practical implementation in hospital clinical laboratories. Here, we describe an on-demand replacement for agar dilution (AD), specifically substituting poloxamer 407 (also known as Pluronic F-127) for Bacto Agar as the solidifying agent. Notably, 20% poloxamer 407 solutions (e.g., with Mueller-Hinton broth) remain liquid at refrigerated temperatures, but solidify upon warming, enabling facile set-up of poloxamer dilution testing (PD) in Petri dish or microwell format. For fosfomycin susceptibility testing, PD and reference agar dilution (AD) showed excellent categorical (CA) and essential (EA) agreement for E. coli (100% and 87%, respectively, n=31). For other Enterobacterales, excluding Klebsiella spp; CA and EA were both 82% (n=17, respectively). For P. aeruginosa, CA and EA were 60% and 100% (n=10), respectively, with the lower CA reflecting the large number of strains tested with MICs near categorical breakpoints. There were no very major errors, while major errors were only observed for Klebsiella spp. Additionally, PD substantially reduced the number of skipped dilutions 6-fold for E. coli (P < 0.0001) and inhibited swarming of Proteus species. We conclude that PD and AD, an imperfect gold standard, have essentially equivalent practical performance and that PD can therefore serve as an on-demand alternative testing methodology in clinical laboratories for fosfomycin testing of gram-negative pathogens. A broader exploration of PD's utility is thus warranted.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

While some of these genes are well characterized, many genes exist which are clearly induced by DNA damage but for which the function is unclear. In Caulobacter crescentus, the toxin-antitoxin (TA) system higBA and a closely associated downstream transcription factor (higX) are strongly induced as part of the SOS response, but the role of higX is unknown. We show that, unexpectedly, HigX functions independently of HigBA as a cell membrane-associated regulator and is toxic when overexpressed in filamentous cells. ChIP-Seq indicated that it binds to several promoters associated with cell envelope regulation. In cells with the SOS response constitutively activated, HigX was overproduced, but at the same time was unable to bind the majority of its target promoters. higX was highly conserved in genomic context among many alpha-proteobacteria, while higBA was only found upstream of it in a small number of Caulobacter genomes, including the universal laboratory strain C. crescentus NA1000. Compositional analysis suggested that higBA originated from a foreign source, while higX is likely ancestral to the alpha-proteobacteria. Our data support a model where dysregulation of HigX production and activity in filamentous {Delta}lexA cells contributes to cell envelope instability and antibiotic sensitivity. Thus, the protective effect of inhibiting cell division during the SOS response in order to repair the DNA, carries the hidden cost of interference with HigX-mediated cell envelope maintenance.", "date": "2025-12-09", "journal": ""}

This lack of empirical data hampers the selection of an optimal RNase HII for a specific practical application. In the present study, we compared biochemical properties of previously cloned RNases HII from E. coli, Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Thermus thermophilus: optimal temperature, pH, salts, divalent cofactors, thermal stability and specific activity. As expected, the most thermostable enzyme was Tth RNase HII, and Mg2+ was the most preferential cofactor for all RNases. Gst RNase HII was partially inhibited by K+ ions, while other enzymes did not demonstrate preferences for any salt. The enzymes from E. coli and G. stearothermophilus were typical RNases HII, while Tth RNase HII was a JRNase (junction ribonuclease).
