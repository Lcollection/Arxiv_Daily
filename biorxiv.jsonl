Developments in computer vision have greatly advanced automated behavior detection and allow high-throughput preclinical and mechanistic studies. An integrated hardware and software solution is necessary to facilitate the adoption of these advances in the field of behavioral neurogenetics, particularly for non-computational laboratories. We have published a series of papers using an open field arena to annotate complex behaviors such as grooming, posture, and gait as well as higher-level constructs such as biological age and pain. Here, we present our, integrated rodent phenotyping platform, JAX Animal Behavior System (JABS), to the community for data acquisition, machine learning-based behavior annotation and classification, classifier sharing, and genetic analysis. The JABS Data Acquisition Module (JABS-DA) enables uniform data collection with its combination of 3D hardware designs and software for real-time monitoring and video data collection. JABS-Active Learning Module (JABS-AL) allows behavior annotation, classifier training, and validation. We introduce a novel graph-based framework ethograph that enables efficient boutwise comparison of JABS-AL classifiers. JABS-Analysis and Integration Module (JABS-AI), a web application, facilitates users to deploy and share any classifier that has been trained on JABS, reducing the effort required for behavior annotation. It supports the inference and sharing of the trained JABS classifiers and downstream genetic analyses (heritability and genetic correlation) on three curated datasets spanning 168 mouse strains that we are publicly releasing alongside this study. This enables the use of genetics as a guide to proper behavior classifier selection. This open-source tool is an ecosystem that allows the neuroscience and genetics community for shared advanced behavior analysis and reduces the barrier to entry into this new field.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Myo-inositol is specifically transported into cells by the sodium-myo-inositol co-transporter-1 (SMIT1), a member of the sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) family expressed in the heart. While myo-inositol is essential for phosphoinositide signaling, osmoregulation, and metabolic homeostasis, dysregulation of SMIT1-mediated myo-inositol transport may contribute to key pathological mechanisms in HF. This study aims to elucidate the role of SMIT1 in the failing heart, especially during left ventricular remodeling that precedes it. Methods and results We used a mouse model of pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction in wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking SMIT1 (Smit1-/-), and primary cultured cardiomyocytes. By combining molecular, structural and functional studies, RNA-sequencing, and calcium measurements, we demonstrate the contribution of myo-inositol and SMIT1 to pathological hypertrophy and the progression towards HF. We found that in comparison to WT controls, Smit1-/- mice were protected against aortic banding induced systolic dysfunction, cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy. This hypertrophic response was driven by SMIT1 expression in cardiomyocytes, where it favors intracellular myo-inositol and Na+ entry, leading to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)- and Ca2+-dependent pro-hypertrophic signaling. Following hemodynamic stress, deletion of SMIT1 significantly altered IP3/calcium effectors, including Carabin, which modulates cardiac hypertrophy through inhibition of the calcineurin/NFAT and Ras/ERK1/2 pathways. Conclusions This work provides important insights into the role of myo-inositol and SMIT1 in cardiomyocytes. We demonstrate that SMIT1 is a key driver of pathological hypertrophy by inducing an IP3/Ca2+-dependent pro-hypertrophic transcriptional reprogramming in cardiomyocytes. These findings identify SMIT1 as a promising therapeutic target for preventing or treating pathological cardiac hypertrophy and HF.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

F.; Coleman-Derr, D.", "abstract": "Plant microbiome engineering remains a significant challenge due to challenges associated with accurately predicting microbiome assembly and function in complex, heterogeneous soil environments. However, host-mediated selection can simplify the process by using plant host phenotype as a reporter of microbiome function; by iteratively selecting microbiomes from hosts with desired phenotypes and using them to inoculate subsequent cohorts of hosts, artificial selection can steer the microbiome towards a composition producing optimized plant phenotypes. In this study, we inoculated rice with wild microbial communities from fallow rice field, desert, and serpentine seep field soils. By challenging these plants with drought and iteratively selecting microbiomes from the least drought stressed plants across multiple generations, we derived simplified microbiomes that enhanced both the growth and drought tolerance of rice. Across selection cycles, microbiomes within and between soil treatments became increasingly similar, implicating both dispersal and selection as drivers of community composition. With amplicon sequencing data we identified specific bacterial taxa associated with improved rice drought phenotypes; while many of these taxa have been previously described as plant growth promoters, we also identified novel taxa exhibiting strong positive correlation with improved drought performance. Lastly, we resolved 272 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) and used these MAGs to identify functions enriched in bacteria driving enhanced drought tolerance. The most significantly enriched functions--particularly glycerol-3-phosphate and iron transport--have been previously implicated as potential mediators of plant-microbe interactions during drought. Altogether, these data demonstrate that host-mediated selection provides an efficient framework for microbiome engineering through the identification of both individual taxa and simplified communities associated with enhanced plant phenotypes.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I & II receptors and costimulatory molecules are absent at diagnosis in FUS::ERG-positive AML, mirroring the phenotype and outcomes of post-transplant relapse. We show that this is driven by overexpression of EZH2, in vitro and in multiple clinical cohorts. While FUS::ERG AML is the most extreme example, this phenotype is shared by lethal CBFA2T3::GLIS2-driven AML, and patients with RUNX1::RUNX1T1 have significantly worse outcomes when EZH2 overexpression co-occurs. The FDA-approved EZH2 inhibitor tazemetostat reverses this phenotype, re-establishes MHC presentation, and elicits immune effector cell-mediated elimination.

Loss- and gain-of-function bacterial mutants involving the phosphocholine biosynthesis locus (licABC) revealed the phosphocholine moiety is critically required to protect against metabolic disease. This C. immunis exopolysaccharide acts by decreasing small-intestinal and visceral fat levels of IL-22, which results in the recruitment of beige cells specifically in visceral adipose tissue and ultimately increased energy expenditure. Importantly, phosphocholine biosynthesis genes are less abundant in humans with obesity or hypertriglyceridemia, findings that suggest the role of bacterial phosphocholine is conserved across mice and humans.

In both sepals and leaves, giant cells are scattered among smaller cells; therefore, we asked whether their spatial arrangement is random. By comparing sepal and leaf epidermises with computationally generated randomized tissues we show that the giant cell pattern becomes less random across the epidermis as the cells surrounding giant cells divide, leading to clustered patterns in mature tissues. Our cell-autonomous and stochastic computational model reproduces the giant cell organization, suggesting that random giant cell initiation together with the divisions of surrounding cells lead to the observed clustered pattern. These findings reveal that cell-size patterning is developmentally regulated by common mechanisms in leaves and sepals, and the spatial pattern of giant cells emerges from the interplay between stochastic cell-autonomous gene expression and tissue growth.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

N.", "abstract": "Forming an episodic memory requires binding together disparate elements that co-occur in a single experience. One model of this process is that neurons representing different components of a memory bind to an \"index\" --- a subset of neurons unique to that memory. Evidence for this model has recently been found in chickadees, which use hippocampal memory to store and recall locations of cached food. Chickadee hippocampus produces sparse, high-dimensional patterns (\"barcodes\") that uniquely specify each caching event. Unexpectedly, the same neurons that participate in barcodes also exhibit conventional place tuning. It is unknown how barcode activity is generated, and what role it plays in memory formation and retrieval. It is also unclear how a memory index (e.g. barcodes) could function in the same neural population that represents memory content (e.g. place). Here, we design a biologically plausible model that generates barcodes and uses them to bind experiential content. Our model generates barcodes from place inputs through the chaotic dynamics of a recurrent neural network and uses Hebbian plasticity to store barcodes as attractor states. The model matches experimental observations that memory indices (barcodes) and content signals (place tuning) are randomly intermixed in the activity of single neurons. We demonstrate that barcodes reduce memory interference between correlated experiences. We also show that place tuning plays a complementary role to barcodes, enabling flexible, contextually-appropriate memory retrieval. Finally, our model is compatible with previous models of the hippocampus as generating a predictive map. Distinct predictive and indexing functions of the network are achieved via an adjustment of global recurrent gain. Our results suggest how the hippocampus may use barcodes to resolve fundamental tensions between memory specificity (pattern separation) and flexible recall (pattern completion) in general memory systems.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

This article presents a new enhanced sampling method called Simulated Solute Tempering 2 (SST2) that builds upon the strengths of ST and REST2. SST2 selectively scales the interactions inside a biomolecule and with its surrounding environment, effectively accelerating the exploration of its different structural states and their stability at various temperatures. SST2 was tested on three different systems (chignolin CLN025, Trp-Cage, and a protein-peptide complex, p97/PNGase) and found to achieve comparable or superior sampling efficiency to ST, SST1 and REST2 while requiring fewer temperature rungs.

Previously, we introduced the Peptidisc membrane mimetic (MM) for water-soluble stabilization of the membrane proteome and interactome (Carlson et al., eLife, 2019). In this work, we combine the Peptidisc with thermal proteome profiling (TPP) to establish membrane mimetic thermal proteome profiling (MM-TPP), a method that enables proteome-wide mapping of membrane protein-ligand interactions. Using a membrane protein library derived from mouse liver tissue, we detected the specific effects of ATP and orthovanadate on the thermal stability of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, as well as stability shifts driven by the hydrotropic effect of ATP and its by-products on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In contrast, detergent-based TPP (DB-TPP) with ATP-VO4 failed to yield specific enrichment of ATP-binding proteins, underscoring the unique capacity of MM-TPP. To further validate the approach, we demonstrated the ability of MM-TPP to detect specific ligand-induced stabilization of cognate targets, exemplified by the selective thermal stabilization of the P2RY12 receptor by 2-methylthio-ADP. Together, these findings position MM-TPP as a robust platform for uncovering both on- and off-target effects of small molecules, providing insights into the druggable membrane proteome and its stability in consequence of changing dynamic ligands.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

This is the largest single-cell data resource for AML to our knowledge, publicly available at https://cellxgene.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/AML/. This AML scAtlas allowed investigations into 20 patients with t(8;21) AML, where we explored the clinical importance of age, allowed exploration of the clinical importance of age in t(8;21) AML to an unprecedented level, given the in-utero origin of pediatric disease.

Furthermore, using an additional multiomic dataset (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq), we validated our initial findings and created a de-noised enhancer-driven GRN reflecting the previously defined age-related signatures. Applying integrated data analysis of the AML scAtlas, we reveal age-dependent gene regulation in t(8;21) AML, perhaps potentially reflecting immature/fetal HSC origin in prenatal origin disease vs postnatal origin.

By generalizing from prior aversive experiences and comparing with a current experience, animals can learn the relative aversive (better or worse than) value or relative positive safety value between experiences. Yet, how such relative value signals are acquired during learning remain poorly known. The paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) is critical for the control of salience and valence signals. It is therefore well-placed to be involved in learning relative aversive value and learned safety. Using a newly-developed conditioned place preference task, we uncover specific behavioral signatures associated with learning relative aversive value and learned safety, and related value-based choices. We then show that neurons expressing dopamine D2 receptor (D2+) in the anterior PVT (aPVT) are preferentially recruited by both relative aversive value learning and learned safety. Using a pharmacogenetic strategy, we demonstrate that aPVT D2+, but not D2-, neurons are involved in learning relative- but not absolute- aversive value. Finally, we show that aPVT D2+, but not D2-, neurons are also critical for the encoding of learned safety. Overall, our findings reveal a novel role of aPVT D2+ neurons in computing relative aversive/safety value signals between experiences during learning to promote appropriate value-based choices.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Lianas often proliferate after such events, yet the mechanisms underlying these increases, particularly their demographic sources, remain unclear. Here, we quantify the extent to which clonal expansion, rather than seed recruitment, accounts for post-disturbance proliferation of Wisteria floribunda (Fabaceae), the dominant liana in the study area. In a 21.6-ha fragmented forest landscape in Japan, we divided the study area into 20 x 20 m grid cells and randomly sampled up to one W. floribunda ramet per cell, and genotyped 273 ramets at 10 microsatellite loci to assign ramets to genets and quantify genet areas and their spatial distribution. Genotyping revealed a substantial contribution of extensive clonal reproduction: 94% of ramets were clonal, resolving into 47 genets. These genets collectively occupied 58% of the 21.6-ha study area, and expansion produced extensive genets; the largest covered 9.5 ha. Several genets spanned multiple forest patches; three multi-patch genets accounted for 43% of all ramets, including one spanning seven patches. Multi-patch genets were concentrated within areas covered by forests prior to fragmentation (odds ratio = 6.83; P < 0.001). These observations indicate that clonal expansion accounts for most post-disturbance proliferation, that some genets attain landscape-scale coverage in a fragmented forest, and that part of this dominance likely reflects legacy effects of genets established prior to fragmentation. Explicitly accounting for clonal contributions and genet spatial scale is critical for accurate prediction of disturbance-driven liana dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

L.; Sullivan, M. B.", "abstract": "Microbiomes influence diverse ecosystems, and viruses increasingly appear to impose key constraints. While viromics has expanded genomic catalogs, host identification for these viruses remains challenging due to the limitations in scaling cultivation-based approaches and the uncertain reliability and relative low resolution of in silico predictions -- particularly for understudied viral taxa. Towards this, Hi-C proximity ligation uses sequenced, cross-linked virus and host genomic fragments to infer virus-host linkages and has now been applied in at least ten studies. However, its accuracy remains unknown. Here we assess Hi-C performance in recovering virus-host interactions using synthetic communities (SynComs) composed of four marine bacterial strains and nine phages with known interactions and then apply optimized bioinformatic protocols to natural soil samples. In SynComs, standard Hi-C sample preparations and analyses showed poor normalized contact score performance (26% specificity, 100% sensitivity, incorrect matches up to class level) that could be dramatically improved by Z-score filtering (Z [&ge;] 0.5, 99% specificity), though at reduced sensitivity (62% down from 100%). Detection limits were established as reproducibility was poor below minimal phage abundances of 105 PFU/mL. Applying optimized bioinformatic protocols to natural soil samples, we compared virus-host linkages inferred from proximity-ligated Hi-C sequencing with predictions generated by in silico homology-based and machine learning-based bioinformatic approaches. Prior to Z-score thresholding, agreement was relatively high at the phylum to family levels (72%), but not at the genus (43%) or species (15%) levels. Z-score thresholding reduced sensitivity (only 34% of predictions were retained), with only modest improvements in congruence with bioinformatic methods (48% or 18% at genus or species levels, respectively). Regardless, this led to 79 genus-level-congruent virus-host linkages and 293 new ones revealed by Hi-C alone -- i.e., providing many new virus-host interactions to explore in already well-studied climate-critical soils. Overall, these findings provide empirical benchmarks and methodological guidelines to improve the accuracy and reliability of Hi-C for virus-host linkage studies in complex microbial communities.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Unfortunately, increased resolution comes with a cost of increased complexity of the biological search space, even at the individual study level, as perturbations are now often examined across many dimensions simultaneously, including different: donor phenotypes, anatomical regions and cell types, and time points. Furthermore, broad integration across studies promise unique opportunity to explore the molecular underpinnings of distinct healthy and disease states, larger than the original scope of the individual study. To fully realize the promise of both individual higher resolution studies and large cross-study integrations we need a robust methodology that can disentangle the influence of technical and non-relevant phenotypic factors, isolating relevant condition-specific signals from shared biological information while also providing interpretable insights into the genetic effects of these conditions. Current methods typically excel in only one of these areas. To address this gap, we developed ALPINE, a supervised non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) framework that effectively separates both technical and non-technical factors while simultaneously offering direct interpretability of condition-associated genes. Through simulations across 4 different scenarios, we demonstrate that ALPINE outperforms existing methods in both isolating the effect of different phenotypic conditions and prioritizing condition-associated genes. Furthermore, ALPINE has favorable performance in batch effect removal compared with state-of-the-art integration methods. When applied to real-world case studies, we showcase how ALPINE can be used to extract insights into the biological mechanisms that underlie differences between phenotypic conditions.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

All trees resolve Capparis as monophyletic, with a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event detected at the crown. Capparis sect. Capparis and sect. Busbeckea are monophyletic, but sect.

Capparis spinosa is geographically, morphologically and phylogenetically structured across northern Australia. Based on these results, we describe five new species and two new subspecies of Capparis, bringing the total number of species in Australia to 26. Capparis xylocarpa, C. megacarpa, C. loxophleba and C. splendidissima are newly described. Capparis loranthifolia var. bancroftii is raised to species level as C. bancroftii.

Here, we used prime editing to modify the endogenous U2AF1 gene in lung adenocarcinoma cells and assessed the resulting impact on alternative splicing. These analyses identified KRAS as a key target modulated by U2AF1S34F. One specific KRAS mutation, G12S, generates a cryptic U2AF1 binding site that leads to skipping of KRAS exon 2 and generation of a non-functional KRAS transcript. Expression of the U2AF1S34F mutant reverts this exon skipping and restores KRAS function. Analysis of cancer genomes reveals that U2AF1S34F mutations are enriched in KRASG12S-mutant lung adenocarcinomas. A comprehensive analysis of splicing factor/oncogene mutation co-occurrence in cancer genomes also revealed significant co-enrichment of KRASQ61R and U2AF1I24T mutations. Experimentally, KRASQ61R mutation leads to KRAS exon 3 skipping, which in turn can be rescued by the expression of U2AF1I24T. Our findings provide evidence that splicing factor mutations can rescue splicing defects caused by oncogenic mutations. More broadly, they demonstrate a dynamic process of cascading selection where mutational events are positively selected in cancer genomes as a consequence of earlier mutations.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

We used fMRI to test whether memory responses emerge in early visual cortex after a single encoding event. Twenty adults viewed objects presented once in one of four parafoveal locations, then later completed recognition (old/new) and location recall tasks in which objects were shown foveally. We found responses in V1 to V3 during both memory tasks tuned to the encoded parafoveal location, even though the recognition task did not ask the participant to remember the encoded location. These responses were more robust and precise for successfully remembered items, linking neural tuning in early visual cortex to one-shot memory performance.

YAP/TAZ signaling drives cortical RGs toward ependymal fate, while SHH signaling facilitates the generation of cortical tripotential intermediate progenitor cells that produce cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and olfactory bulb interneurons. During evolution, cortical outer radial glia (oRGs) acquire dominant ERK/PKA signaling through a self-reinforcing feedback mechanism that suppresses both YAP and SHH pathways, thereby significantly enhancing oRG self-renewal capacity and extending the neurogenic period.

While altered asymmetries have long been implicated, evidence is inconsistent, with limited consideration given to individual variability in lateralization patterns. This study investigated hemispheric lateralization in 35 adults with dyslexia and 35 matched controls using functional MRI across three language tasks: word generation, rhyming decision, and lexical decision. Laterality indices (LIs) were calculated to comprehensively assess the strength, direction, and consistency of activation across global and regional task-specific brain areas. Significant group differences were not found in the absolute strength of lateralization for global measures or any regional measures, except in the fusiform gyrus, where people with dyslexia showed lower asymmetry. Directional asymmetry was similar across the two groups, except in the fusiform gyrus during the reading task, where dyslexic individuals showed a higher prevalence of right-hemisphere lateralization compared to controls. Interestingly, we found that dyslexic participants demonstrated greater inconsistency in regional lateralization during reading and rhyming tasks. Among individuals with dyslexia, those with inconsistent lateralization in the reading task had weaker fusiform lateralization, although fusiform LI strength itself did not predict reading outcomes. Our findings suggest that dyslexia is characterized by inconsistent, rather than universally weaker, lateralization patterns. Inconsistencies in task-related and regional lateralization may disrupt the efficiency of language networks, contributing to observed reading deficits. By highlighting the role of regional and task-specific inconsistencies, this study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia and underscores the importance of considering individual variability in hemispheric lateralization when investigating language disorders.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Dengue virus (DENV) exploits cholesterol-rich membranes and host lipid pathways, such as cholesterol biosynthesis, lipid raft organization, and lipid droplet formation, for entry, replication, and assembly. Additionally, lipid-based plasma membrane signaling can trigger innate immune responses that attenuate viral growth, underscoring the dual role of lipids in facilitating and restricting DENV infection. Here, we demonstrate that 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), an oxidized cholesterol metabolite, inhibits DENV infection through a multifaceted mechanism. 25-HC disrupts viral membrane fusion by altering cholesterol distribution and lipid raft organization, impairing the binding and fusion of the DENV envelope (E) protein with host membranes. Additionally, 25-HC modulates host cholesterol metabolism by suppressing biosynthesis pathways essential for viral replication while enhancing lipid droplet formation and stress-response pathways. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that 25-HC primes innate immune responses, activating pro-inflammatory pathways such as the NLRP3 inflammasome and MAPK signaling, while selectively modulating interferon-stimulated gene expression. Notably, 25-HC exhibits synergistic antiviral effects when combined with direct-acting antivirals like Remdesivir, underscoring its potential in combination therapies.

These landscapes show excellent agreement with those from more computationally expensive benchmark methods.

The capacity to measure forces in populations of cells and to identify subsets within heterogeneous ensembles would enable to reveal and manipulate their intrinsic complexity. Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) is a technology that can quantify the contractile forces exerted by cells via measuring the displacement of fluorescent beads embedded on the surface of a soft substrate with precisely defined mechanical properties. However, conventional numerical approaches for measuring cellular forces using TFM are labor-intensive and can yield significant artifacts, making them ill-suited for high-throughput analysis.

Highly promising candidates for electrophysiological markers have been identified, but progress is hindered by substantial methodological variability across studies. This makes it challenging to establish a clear consensus on the frequency, location, and direction of any single reported effect within the larger body of research. We estimate a full-frequency whole-head profile of the ageing effect on eyes-closed resting-state MEG using the GLM-Spectrum. This data representation is easily sharable, facilitates meta-analyses and provides a framework for estimating statistical power of age effects for future study planning. We use this to show that the effect of age replicates across open-access MEG datasets and is robust to modelling of common covariates. Distinct components within the full frequency profile have different effect sizes, indicating that sample-size planning for ageing effects must consider the specific features of interest. The frequency profile of ageing is strongly robust to a range of common covariates and partially robust to modelling of grey matter volume.

How genetic pleiotropy itself emerges, however, remains unclear. The maize genes GRASSY TILLERS1 (GT1) and RAMOSA3 (RA3) are required for axillary meristem suppression, a deeply conserved trait across angiosperms, and for floral organ suppression, a trait which evolved within the grass family. To determine how these pleiotropic functions are regulated, we first established a high-throughput method for quantitative phenotyping of grass flowers. Using this method, we show that distinct environmental mechanisms regulate axillary meristem versus floral organ suppression. In line with these differences, we find upstream regulation of GT1 and RA3 has diverged, consistent with their redeployment in flowers. Our results show that, rather than wholesale adoption of genetic networks, developmental genes can retain ancient functions and be recruited into other programs in the evolution of form, thereby increasing genetic pleiotropy.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have shown that BAT development and function are under epigenetic control, with DNA methylation linked to the regulation of key thermogenic and metabolic genes. Here we sought to understand how diet and cold exposure interactively shape BAT gene regulation controlled by DNA methylation. Mice (N = 8 per group) were housed under cold exposure (8 C) or thermoneutrality (30 C) and fed either chow or high-fat diet (HFD). BAT was isolated for transcriptome (RNAseq) and methylome (RRBS) analyses. We identified differentially methylated and expressed genes (DMEGs) by comparing the effects of cold exposure under chow and high-fat diet, as well as by analyzing the interaction between temperature and diet. Functional pathway enrichment and EpiFactors Database screening were used to assess epigenetic regulators, and candidate gene expression was validated by modulating DNA methylation in vitro. We identified ~1,360 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) uniquely affected by the diet-temperature interaction with most downregulated in HFD-fed mice, indicating that obesity limits the transcriptional response of BAT to cold. 65 DMEGs (4% of DEGs) were largely diet-specific in response to cold exposure, suggesting that DNA methylation contributes to a selective layer of gene regulation during BAT adaptation to distinct metabolic states. In HFD-fed mice, DMEGs were enriched in pathways related to mitochondrial dysfunction, altered lipid metabolism, neuroendocrine signaling, and compensatory stress responses, contrasting the adaptive thermogenic profile observed in chow-fed controls. Differentially expressed genes of epigenetic regulators such as Tet2, Dnmt3a and Apobec1 showed diet- and cold-dependent regulation, indicating impaired methylation flexibility under obesogenic conditions. Using cell culture experiments, we confirmed the regulation of gene expression of candidate genes, validating the functional link between DNA methylation and thermogenic gene regulation. This is the first study to demonstrate an epigenetic response to cold exposure that differs by dietary condition, particularly in obesity. Our findings highlight a coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling of BAT, shaped by both environmental and metabolic signals. These insights may inform targeted epigenetic or nutritional strategies to restore BAT function and would further strengthen our understanding of how these might be used as therapeutic basis to improve metabolic health in obesity.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Despite successful preservation efforts, their immense biodiversity is still severely underrepresented in germplasm biobanks throughout the world. These culture libraries can preserve genetic diversity and provide inoculum for marine forest restoration and mariculture ventures, and potentially accelerate the selection and breeding of climate-resilient and high-yielding strains. However, the complex life cycles and body plans of seaweeds pose a huge challenge for the development of standardized phenotyping and isolating protocols for microscopic stages, especially with the efficiency necessary to deal with the current pace of global climatic changes. Here, we present SAMMBA (Seaweed Automatable Microplate Microscopy for Breeding Approaches), an end-to-end pipeline for the high-throughput isolation, phenotyping and storage of macroalgal cells in 384-well plates (384WP). By optimizing fluorescence microscopy imaging and analysis, along with a novel fragmentation method and dilution-to-extinction isolation, different unialgal seaweed tissues could be regrown after thousand-fold dilutions. In a single plate, we successfully isolated 68 singlet gametophyte fragments of Laminaria ochroleuca (39 males, 29 females; 17.7% efficiency) and 60 spores of Phyllariopsis purpurascens (12.1% efficiency). Furthermore, the taxonomic versatility of SAMMBA was demonstrated through the successful isolation of 60 unialgal cultures of red algae (Halymenia sp., Hydrolithon sp., Erythrotrichia sp.) and 10 strains of the green alga Ulva sp, without cross-contamination. The viability and unialgal nature of the isolated strains were verified by distributing a single L. ochroleuca strain across an entire 384-well plate and imaging each well over 30 days. We found that the average specific daily growth rates (daily SGR) per well were 0.130 {+/-} 0.006 and 0.117 {+/-} 0.01 day-1 for males and females, respectively, showing a significant difference between sexes (n = 768; p = 1.27e-53), while edge effects significantly reduced daily SGR in males but not in females. This approach dramatically increases experimental reproducibility and statistical power compared to conventional methods. Due to its modular design and cost-effectiveness, SAMMBA is readily adaptable to macroalgal repositories globally. It supports high-throughput, selective recovery of unialgal strains without reliance on robotic platforms, while remaining fully compatible with automation. This system significantly expands the experimental and operational capacity in macroalgal hatcheries, providing a scalable foundation for phenomics, domestication programs, and standardized, verifiable biobanking of unialgal strains. Ultimately, SAMMBA could provide critical support for breeding strategies required to ensure the resilience of marine forests and aquaculture in a rapidly changing ocean.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Using a mouse model of the local Shwartzman reaction, we show that JSP1 is essential for LPS-TNF-induced vascular injury. JSP1-deficient mice exhibited reduced vascular hemorrhage. Neutrophil depletion and adoptive transfer experiments confirmed that JSP1-expressing neutrophils mediate this injury. JSP1 was not required for neutrophil development or surface receptor abundance but was essential for integrin activation and adhesion. Reduced SYK and HCK phosphorylation in JSP1-deficient neutrophils are consistent with a mechanism involving impaired integrin-SRC signaling. These findings establish JSP1 as a key regulator of neutrophil-driven vascular inflammation.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

In this study, we provide a comprehensive comparison of two widely used HIS models: the Hu-CD34+ model, which engrafts Hu-hematopoietic cells derived from Hu-CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and the Hu-PBMC model, which utilizes Hu-peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

Whether such intrinsic self-repair is sufficient to preserve microtubule integrity during dynamic molecular-motor induced buckling, which frequently occurs in cells, remains unclear. Here, we show that kinesin- driven microtubule buckling in vitro induces severe lattice damage, leading to extensive tubulin incorporation. In many cases, however, the damage exceeds the microtubules' capacity for self-repair, resulting in breakage. In contrast, microtubules survive continuous buckling substantially longer in the presence of intracellular factors. Our results identify the limits of intrinsic microtubule self-repair and demonstrate that additional cellular mechanisms are essential to maintain microtubule integrity under sustained mechanical load.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

The activity of the decameric eukaryotic initiation factor 2B complex (eIF2B) initiates TC assembly by catalyzing GDP to GTP exchange on eIF2, thereby setting the TC levels in the cell. Stress-induced phosphorylation converts eIF2 from the substrate of the GDP/GTP exchange reaction into an inhibitor (eIF2-P) of eIF2B. This conversion reduces the cells TC levels and induces the widespread reprogramming of translation known as the Integrated Stress Response (ISR). Here, we chart an allosteric axis running through eIF2B, revealing the importance of a protrusive -helix in its {beta}-subunit, the latch-helix, that locks onto the -subunit to induce eIF2B activity. eIF2-P binding unhooks the latch-helix, opening eIF2B, which inhibits its GDP/GTP exchange activity. Distinct viral proteins have convergently evolved to bind to eIF2B and stabilize the latch-helix-bound active state. Using these insights, we generated ISR-ACTivating compounds, ISRACTs, that stabilize eIF2B in its inhibited, unlatched state. Our study thus highlights how state-transitions in eIF2B are regulated via long-range allostery.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Unexpectedly, cell-type-specific enhancers of genes essential for INP formation are poised in T1NBs despite never generating INP progeny. Thus, both NB types are competent to generate INPs. Inducing T1NBs to generate INPs is more efficient upon asense knockdown. The progeny of T2NBs expressing elevated Asense adopt a low-potential TAP identity instead of INPs. Elevated Asense expression limits tumor NB expansion driven by stalled INPs halting tumor expansion.

ViV1T outperformed state-of-the-art models in predicting responses to both natural and artificial dynamic stimuli, while requiring fewer parameters and reducing runtime. Despite being trained exclusively on natural movies, ViV1T accurately captured core V1 properties, including orientation and direction selectivity as well as contextual modulation, despite lacking explicit feedback mechanisms. ViV1T also revealed novel functional features. The model predicted a wider range of contextual responses when using natural and model-generated surround stimuli compared to traditional gratings, with novel model-generated dynamic stimuli eliciting maximal V1 responses. ViV1T also predicted that dynamic surrounds elicited stronger contextual modulation than static surrounds. Finally, the model identified a subpopulation of neurons that exhibit contrast-dependent surround modulation, switching their response to surround stimuli from inhibition to excitation when contrast decreases. These predictions were validated through semi-closed-loop in vivo recordings. Overall, ViV1T establishes a powerful, data-driven framework for understanding how brain sensory areas process dynamic visual information across space and time.

Emerging evidence implicates PIKfyve in key cellular processes, including melanosome formation, phagocytosis, endosomal trafficking, lysosomal maintenance, and autophagy. Complete loss of PIKfyve function is embryonically lethal in model organisms. In humans, heterozygous mutations in PIKFYVE are associated with Fleck corneal dystrophy and congenital cataracts. In this study, we investigate the role of PIKfyve in photoreceptors and the adjacent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Photoreceptors detect light via the outer segment (OS), a specialized sensory structure composed of stacked membranous discs rich in photopigment. The OS is continuously renewed, and a primary function of the RPE is to phagocytose OS tips. To assess PIKfyve function in the retina and RPE in our zebrafish model, we employed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing and pharmacological inhibition using the specific PIKfyve inhibitor apilimod. Loss of PIKfyve activity leads to RPE expansion characterized by the accumulation of LC3- and LAMP1-positive vacuoles, along with defects in phagosome degradation and minor changes to melanosome biogenesis. Photoreceptors deprived of PIKfyve function develop a single large vacuole in the inner segment, while the OS remains mostly intact over the timespan analyzed.

However, little is known on how molecules involved in neuronal differentiation might affect subsequent steps of axonal development such as axonal morphogenesis. The sequoia (seq) mutant was identified in a Drosophila genetic screen for defects in dendrite elaboration. Sequoia is a pan-neural nuclear protein containing two putative zinc-fingers homologous to the DNA binding domain of Tramtrack. Mutations in seq have been reported to affect the cell fate decision of external sensory organ neurons and to effect axon and dendrite morphology. Previous reports have focused mainly on the effects this mutation causes in dendritic morphogenesis in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Amongst mutants isolated from a previous mutagenesis screen, we have identified three new alleles of sequoia, GA168, C022 and C3101 and identify the molecular lesions in two previously identified alleles, Z1241 and H156 (1). Analysis of these five alleles has revealed that seq mutations lead to several defects in nervous system development. seq mutants show defects in the spatial  organization of their CNS from early developmental stages and have abnormal cell morphology, both at early and late stages of embryonic development.

Recently, an atypical case of SCA was documented in a mixed breed dog. In addition to the classic clinical signs and spinocerebellar lesions of SCA, the dog had retinal and optic nerve degeneration and severe, non-regenerative anemia. Whole-genome sequence (WGS) of the affected dog did not reveal any previously identified canine SCA-associated variants.

We found that Prochlorococcus populations resumed growth following infection only in the presence of heterotrophs, independent of phage:host or heterotroph:host ratios. In phage:host pairing with Synechococcus the outcomes varied, suggesting that the impact of heterotrophs on phage infection may be dependent on the phage:host interaction. In cases where the host recovered from phage infection, heterotrophs appeared to facilitate it both by mitigating oxidative stress and possibly supplying organic carbon sources, which may support post-infection growth.

Here we examine the effects of heterotrophic bacteria on phage infection in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus by comparing phage infection dynamics in cultures with and without heterotrophs present. We found that Prochlorococcus populations resumed growth following infection only in the presence of heterotrophs, independent of phage:host or heterotroph:host ratios. In phage:host pairing with Synechococcus the outcomes varied, suggesting that the impact of heterotrophs on phage infection may be dependent on the phage:host interaction. In cases where the host recovered from phage infection, heterotrophs appeared to facilitate it both by mitigating oxidative stress and possibly supplying organic carbon sources, which may support post-infection growth. Furthermore, Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus populations that recovered from infection were resistant to phage infection when transferred to fresh media. Evidence argues against genetic change as the mechanism of resistance, suggesting that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus populations in co-culture with heterotrophs undergo non-genetic adaptations during recovery from phage infection, likely driven by heterotroph-derived organic compounds that reshape host metabolism and confer protection against future lysis.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

However, existing approaches rarely capture explicit spatiotemporal perturbation dynamics, limiting the ability to reconstruct how perturbations propagate over time, spread across space, and induce feedback at multiple biological scales. Here we introduce DynPerturb, a dynamic inference framework for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics that systematically models the \"when-how strong-where\" dimensions of perturbations. DynPerturb incorporates temporal encoding, spatial adjacency, and memory modules to capture nonlinear signal propagation and cross-regional feedback with mechanistic interpretability. Across temporal benchmarking datasets, DynPerturb consistently outperformed existing methods in regulatory link prediction, demonstrated zero-shot generalization to unseen nodes, and preserved accuracy under varying sparsity conditions and temporal resolutions. Applied to representative biological systems, DynPerturb uncovers dynamic regulatory rewiring in kidney disease, highlighting a mid-age sensitivity window and potential reversibility with early intervention; delineated a temporal fate-switching boundary between megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs) and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) during hematopoiesis; and revealed spatiotemporal interchamber signaling in murine heart development, where Igf2 perturbations induced spatial feedback shaping chamber proportioning.

In recent years, a subset of these genes has been identified; however, their sequences are unusually problematic, often evading detection by standard sequencing technologies. This limitation has hindered detailed investigation of the phenomenon - until recent progress in long read technologies, which are more robust against sequencing biases. This enabled us to classify real gene losses extensively, which strikingly revealed that a large number of the genes residing on so-called dot chromosomes were indeed lost during avian evolution. We demonstrate that dot microchromosomes - small, repeat-dense avian chromosomes -harbor widespread gene attrition, with 29% of ohnologs (duplicates from ancestral genome doublings) eliminated, far exceeding rates on other chromosomes. Moreover, we reveal that genes retained on these dot chromosomes exhibit a previously undescribed form of dynamic genetic instability. This instability, which we term sequence stuttering, is characterized by a massive expansion of short sequences within intronic regions. Intriguingly, in some cases, the expanding sequences appear to originate from neighboring exons. As a result, intron lengths vary extensively among individual chickens, suggesting that these events are evolutionarily recent. Since this phenomenon has not been reported in any other vertebrate species, our findings lay the groundwork for future research into its underlying mechanisms, evolutionary implications, and potential identification of similar loci across vertebrate genomes.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

To address this, we tested the impact of decreased intrinsic nucleosome stability across multiple cell, tissue and organismal models by introducing histone mutants that weaken histone/histone interactions. While nucleosome instability did not broadly alter global chromatin accessibility, DNA damage, cell proliferation or viability, it impaired lineage-specific gene expression programs, altered lineage specification and activated intrinsic inflammatory and stress pathways in a manner reminiscent of aging in mouse tissues and human cells. Consistently, nucleosome instability accelerated the onset of age-associated transcriptional alterations and functional decline in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, and reduced cellular resilience to exogenous perturbations, including environmental, epigenetic and mitotic stress in human cells and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These cross-species findings identify nucleosome stability as an evolutionarily conserved epigenetic safeguard that preserves cell identity and stress resilience and supports organismal function and healthy aging.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Nucleosome remodeling complexes hydrolyze ATP to translocate DNA and thereby mobilize histone proteins. While nucleosome remodeling complexes have been extensively studied for their roles in regulating nucleosome positioning and accessibility, their contributions to higher-order chromatin architecture remain less well understood. Here, we investigate the roles of two key nucleosome remodelers, esBAF and INO80C, in shaping 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using Hi-C, we find that loss of either remodeler has minimal effects on global compartment or TAD structures. In contrast, subcompartment organization is notably altered, suggesting that esBAF and INO80C contribute to finer-scale chromatin topology. To overcome the limited resolution of Hi-C for detecting regulatory loops, we employed promoter capture Micro-C (PCMC), which revealed that the loss of esBAF or INO80C alters a subset of promoter anchored looping interactions. Although these changes occur at distinct genomic loci for each remodeler, the affected sites are commonly enriched for bivalent chromatin regions bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (OSN), as well as BRG1 and INO80 themselves. Together, our findings reveal that esBAF and INO80C selectively influence subcompartment identity and enhancer-promoter communication at key regulatory loci, highlighting a previously underappreciated role for nucleosome remodelers in higher-order chromatin organization.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, we could determine the actual enzyme kcat value at all saturating substrates to be 22 s-1. This value is 5-fold higher than the previously reported apparent kcat values determined at physiological, non-saturating oxygen concentration.

While recent studies have characterized features associated with primary and acquired resistance to KRAS inhibitors, strategies to overcome such resistance, particularly in the context of gastrointestinal cancers, remain underexplored. Here, we have generated nine human gastrointestinal cancer models, including three patient-derived organoids (PDOs), with acquired resistance to the KRAS G12D-selective inhibitor MRTX1133. Using single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, we identified the enrichment of angiogenesis, hypoxia, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures in the resistant model compared to the parental PDO. Across all resistant models, VEGFA expression and VEGFR2 phosphorylation were uniformly elevated, which were driven by AKT activation and SP1 nuclear translocation. Mechanistic investigations uncovered increased PI3K{gamma} activity in MRTX1133-resistant models via complex formation of KRAS with p110{gamma} and p101. This leads to an autocrine VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling loop formation and EMT induction. Therapeutically, the disruption of VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling restored MRTX1133 sensitivity and inhibited EMT. Furthermore, cancer-endothelial paracrine signaling amplified angiogenesis, hypoxia, and EMT signatures in cancer cells and simultaneously promoted endothelial cell proliferation, reinforcing an adaptive feedback mechanism. In a mouse model of MRTX1133-resistant tumor xenograft, a combination of anti-VEGFR2 therapy and MRTX1133 more effectively reduced tumor growth, angiogenesis, and proliferation markers than monotherapy without significant body weight change. These findings establish VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling by PI3K{gamma} activation as a key driver of acquired resistance to KRAS G12D inhibition and provide a rationale for combining VEGFA-VEGFR2 inhibition with KRAS blockade in KRAS-mutant cancers.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

This gene produces two alternatively spliced secretory proteins, designated Lc-CXCL17a and Lc-CXCL17b, which display limited sequence similarity to known CXCL17s from mammals or ray-finned fishes.

The limited pharmacological options targeting VHL-HBs stem from an incomplete understanding of their cellular origin, development, and molecular pathogenesis. Here we use advanced mouse genetics to show that mosaic deletion of Vhl in Apln+ cells leads to the formation of precursor tumour-like lesions, composed by clusters of Vhl-knockout (VhlKO) astrocytes and surrounding Vhl-wild-type (VhlWT) vessels that become malformed, resembling early-stage HBs linked to VHL disease. VhlKO astrocytes morphologically and transcriptomically resembled the reactive astrocytes characteristic of ischemic CNS injury. They exhibited metabolic rewirement towards glycolysis and upregulation of cell growth pathways. They also expressed several secreted proangiogenic molecules that activate and prevent the normal maturation of neighbouring vessels, leading to VHL-HBs. Temporal conditional genetic analysis revealed that Vhl loss need to happen during postnatal development for HBs to form, and that lesions become quiescent in early adulthood. HIF-2 deletion, or MTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin, efficiently inhibited VHL-HBs growth and the associated vascular malformations. Our work shows that the loss of Vhl in single astrocytes induces their growth and pathogenic crosstalk with neighbouring endothelial cells, driving hemangioblastoma development in VHL disease.

While cellular populations reaching confluence are known to have limited sensitivity to ferroptosis, an understanding of the interplay between growth dynamics, ROS levels and ferroptosis is currently lacking. Here we use live-cell imaging coupled to ROS tracing to reveal a feedback loop between population growth and ferroptotic cell death. Starting out from the observation that the cellular proliferation rate declines with increased cellular density, we find that ROS levels also decline with increasing cellular density. Low ROS levels make cells insensitive to ferroptosis, which in turn enables population growth. This feedback produces two steady states: (i) a ferroptosis-insensitive state characterized by slow growth, low levels of ROS and low rates of cell death and (ii) a ferroptosis-sensitive state characterized by rapid growth, ROS accumulation, and high rates of ferroptosis. Interestingly, triggering effective ferroptosis by interfering with GPX4 activity is directly linked with this mechanism. On the other hand, keeping cell numbers and drug concentration/cell constant while restricting growth space led to reduced proliferation, reduced ROS and decreased ferroptotic cell death. Importantly, ferroptosis resistance at high cellular confluency could be broken by increasing cellular ROS and lipid ROS through a galactose-promoted OXPHOS switch. A mathematical model of the feedback mechanism predicts the long-term fate of populations as well as their ferroptosis sensitivity when external conditions impacting cell proliferation rates, ROS or both are changed.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Background: In structurally normal hearts, gain of function variants (GOF) in the intracellular calcium (Ca2+) release channel RyR2 predominately underlie the inherited arrhythmogenic syndrome catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). Patients with CPVT are susceptible to life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias triggered by emotional or physical stress. At the cellular level, adrenergic stimulation activates both protein kinase A (PKA) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) which phosphorylate selective sites on the RyR2 channel to enhance Ca2+ release. The relative contribution of PKA versus CaMKII phosphorylation of RyR2 to CPVT pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Methods: Using multiplex genomic engineering, we ablated the CaMKII phosphorylation site on RyR2 by mutating serine 2814 to alanine (S2814A) in conjunction with a novel CPVT GOF variant (R4650I). We systematically interrogated the consequences of CaMKII phosphorylation site ablation on the same or opposite allele with the CPVT variant at multiple phenotypic levels. Results: We found that the novel GOF variant Ryr2-R4650I confers a risk of adrenergically inducible ventricular arrhythmia including bi-directional ventricular tachycardia (BiVT). Through genome-editing, inclusion of the CaMKII phosphorylation Ryr2-S2814A mutation on the same allele as the GOF variant completely abrogates inducible arrhythmia. In contrast, with the Ryr2-S2814A variant on the opposite allele, there is no difference in the frequency, type, or length of inducible ventricular tachycardia as compared to animals heterozygous for the Ryr2-R4650I variant alone. Furthermore, allelic concordance of Ryr2-R4650I and Ryr2-S2814A does not inhibit adrenergically-induced enhancement of RyR2-dependent functions including heart rate response, augmentation of cellular Ca2+ flux or intracellular Ca2+ release. Conclusions: Our data strongly supports the hypothesis that CaMKII phosphorylation of RyR2 at S2814 is necessary and sufficient to unmask the arrhythmogenic phenotype in CPVT. Furthermore, CaMKII phosphorylation is an intra-molecular event with implications for therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

This study explores, for the first time, whether natural daily rhythms influence heart regeneration - a process driven by cardiomyocyte proliferation. We discovered that DNA replication, mitosis, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis follow a precise daily order in regenerating zebrafish hearts. Disrupting core clock gene expression abolishes the rhythms of glycolysis and mitosis, preventing cardiomyocyte cell cycle progression and regeneration. Insulin-resistant Astyanax mexicanus cavefish, which have adapted to dark caves, similarly show a loss of mitosis rhythm and cardiomyocyte cell cycle progression, which we find is caused by reduced glycolysis. Despite this reduction, glycolysis rhythm displays a larger amplitude in cavefish - a pattern recapitulated in insulin-resistant zebrafish.

Applied to epithelial sheet migration driven by MAPK/ERK, our approach quantitatively predicted single-cell movement from local chemical and mechanical cues. Examination of the learned equations further indicated that cells process environmental signals by computing their spatiotemporal derivatives.

This has triggered a growing interest in carefully examining the nature and mechanisms of the primitive versions of learning abilities, which would provide important clues for understanding the evolution of behavioral capabilities in organisms. In this study, we focused on previous experimental studies showing that the slime mold Physarum polycephalum, a model organism for studying protist behavior, exhibits the ability to adapt to chemical environments. We propose a possible dynamic mechanism underlying this habituation, reproducing reported experimental observations with accuracy. By refining a mathematical model that was as simple as possible and based on non-specific biochemical processes within cells, we clarified a plausible mechanistic framework. Based on these results, we examined the similarities and differences between this framework and previously proposed habituation models of single-cell movement and animal neural-circuit regulation.

Your choice of objects is likely to depend on visual occurrence statistics (i.e., the objects present in previously encountered bedrooms) and semantic relations between objects and scenes (i.e., the semantic relationship between the bedroom and its constituent objects). To investigate how these two factors contribute to the composition of typical scene drawings, we analyzed 1,192 drawings of six indoor scene categories, obtained from 303 participants. For each object featured in the drawings, we estimated its visual occurrence frequency from the ADE20K dataset of annotated scene images, and its semantic relatedness to the scene concept from a word2vec language processing model. Across all scenes of a given category, generalized linear models revealed that visual and conceptual factors both predicted the likelihood of an object featuring in the scene drawings, with a combined model outperforming both single-factor models. We further computed the visual and semantic specificity of objects for a given scene, that is, how diagnostic an object is for the scene. Object specificity offered only weak predictive power when predicting the selection of objects, yet even infrequently drawn objects remained diagnostic of their scenes. Taken together, we show that visual and conceptual factors jointly shape the composition of typical scene drawings. By releasing a large dataset of typical scene drawings alongside this work, we further provide a starting point for future studies exploring other critical properties of human drawings.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "T cells are critical executors of adaptive immune responses and their persistence is tightly regulated. Part of this regulation relies on programmed cell death driven by the Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) receptor superfamily. The addition of glycans that terminate in the monosaccharide sialic acid (sialoglycans) to these cell death receptors has been shown to attenuate their apoptotic functions. While this is now understood to be a pro-survival mechanism in settings of cancer pathophysiology, the specific roles of sialoglycans in regulating cell death receptor activity on human T cells remains unexplored. This is of particular importance given the rising interest in T cell glycan editing for therapeutic benefit. Here, we address this gap using both immortalized (Jurkat) and primary human T cells deficient in sialoglycans. We found that T cell sialoglycans suppressed apoptosis induced by the Fas receptor (FasR) but not other TNF receptor superfamily members such as TNFR1 and TRAIL-R1. Dynamic reorganization of FasR was increased on sialoglycan-deficient Jurkat cells, suggesting that these glycans limit receptor clustering. This model was further supported by phosphoproteomics results, which confirmed that loss of sialoglycans negatively regulated the pro-survival MAPK/ERK signalling pathway. Finally, we used a recombinant sialic acid cleaving enzyme (sialidase) to confirm that sialoglycans on primary human T cells are bona fide immunophysiological regulators of FasR-driven programmed cell death. Combined, our results demonstrate that sialoglycan remodelling on T cells influences cell fate driven by the Fas pathway and provide motivation to further characterize the immunoregulatory roles of the glycocalyx in health and disease.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

TDP-43 aggregation and condensation are associated with neurodegenerative disease. However, the proteostasis mechanisms that regulate these processes remain elusive. Some evidence has shown that the molecular chaperone small heat shock protein HspB1 binds to and regulates the cytoplasmic phase separation of TDP-43, indicating that other small heat shock proteins may have similar effects. Here, we demonstrate divergent behaviours for HspB1 and its homolog HspB5 on TDP-43LCD condensation and aggregation. In addition to inhibiting TDP-43LCD aggregation, HspB1 partitions into TDP-43LCD condensates and increases the dynamic exchange of TDP-43LCD within condensates and with the surrounding solution. These effects of HspB1 are enhanced by mutations that mimic phosphorylation. HspB5 inhibits TDP-43LCD aggregation more effectively than HspB1 and partitions into TDP-43LCD condensates, where it delays pathological transition of the condensate to a gel/solid. We localise the chaperone effects of HspB1 and HspB5 to the N- and C-terminal regions of the protein, emphasising the role of sequence diversity in these regions in defining small heat shock protein function. These findings demonstrate that HspB1 and HspB5 are regulators of TDP-43 phase separation and aggregation and may be potential therapeutic targets in mitigating toxic TDP-43 aggregation in neurodegenerative disease.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that flow control acts as a variable proportional-derivative error regulator, where the parameter {Gamma} represents the desired norm of the hip-knee joint velocity vector (path speed). Based on this, we introduce two modifications to {Gamma}: (1) a constant {Gamma} set to the mean desired path speed, and (2) a variable {Gamma} that mimics natural path speed during unassisted walking. We compared the modified flow controllers with a slow-{Gamma} version in experiments involving seven participants walking on a treadmill at 0.6m/s, 0.8 m/s, and 1.0 m/s. Compared to the slow-{Gamma} controller, the RMS tracking error decreased by 30.7 {+/-} 11.3% and the range of motion of the knee increased by 48.2 {+/-} 5.5% for the mean-{Gamma} controller, while the variable-{Gamma} controller had 32.4 {+/-}14.7% smaller RMS error and 50.5 {+/-} 6.5% larger range of motion of the knee. Additionally, the slow-{Gamma} controller consistently applied resistive power, whereas participants reported more comfortable and natural gait with the modified controllers.

Here, we introduce a biophysical model that explicitly couples adhesion complex dynamics to intracellular mechanics across cell boundaries. A cadherin dimer plus associated catenins connecting two cells is represented as a spring whose ends experience drag with respect to the moving actin cytoskeleton. The cytoskeleton is modeled as a contractile gel driven by myosin activity in its bulk and forces from adhesion on its boundaries. Our model captures this bidirectional coupling via a coarse-grained continuum framework and reveals a range of observed cell- and tissue-scale behaviors. These include global cell polarization of the multicellular collective, other polarization patterns and oscillatory dynamics, spontaneously formed actin rings within cells, and supracellular stress chains. Many of these features arise from modeling the direct mechanical coupling between cytoskeleton and adhesion.

We found that exposure to high cholesterol (HC) in vivo induced long-term metabolic changes in macrophages differentiated ex vivo from bone marrow, leading to a pro-inflammatory profile; these changes persisted in vivo despite cholesterol lowering. HSC from HC mice had altered chromatin accessibility that persisted after cholesterol lowering and was also present in bone marrow monocytes and tissue resident macrophages. HC provoked RUNX1-dependent downregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) which reduced mono-unsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) availability for OxPhos in murine and human monocytes and macrophages. Supplementation with MUFA restored OxPhos capacity and promoted a shift towards a less pro-inflammatory macrophage phenotype in HC-trained BMDM. Bone marrow chimera and lineage tracking studies revealed that prior exposure of HSC to HC conferred adverse systemic metabolic effects on normocholesterolemic mice, with increased adipose tissue mass and increased migration of macrophages derived from HC-exposed HSC into adipose tissue, resulting in increased adipose tissue inflammation and systemic glucose intolerance.

HGPS is caused by mutations in LMNA that lead to expression of an internally truncated, farnesylated prelamin A variant called progerin, which induces loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Some studies have also reported that accumulation of full-length farnesylated prelamin A, which is normally completely processed to mature non-farnesylated lamin A, can also drive vascular pathology during physiological aging. METHODS: To assess the effects of prelamin A expression on atherosclerosis and aortic VSMCs, we used LmnaL648R/L648R mice that express a prelamin A variant with a lysine to arginine point mutation that prevents its processing to mature lamin A. To determine if prelamin A expression has an impact on atherosclerotic plaques, we crossed LmnaL648R/L648R mice to LDL receptor-deficient Ldlr-/- mice that develop hyperlipidemia on a high-fat diet. RESULTS: Atherosclerotic plaque lesion area and necrotic core area were not different in hyperlipidemic LmnaL648R/L648R mice that expressed only prelamin A, and no mature lamin A, compared to hyperlipidemic Lmna+/+ mice that expressed only fully-processed mature lamin A and no prelamin A. Additionally, exclusive prelamin A expression did not result in loss of aortic VSMCs or adventitial thickening in hyperlipidemic LmnaL648R/L648R mice with atherosclerosis at 28 weeks of age. Indeed, aortic vascular smooth muscle remained normal in older LmnaL648R/L648R mice at 52 weeks of age. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the prelamin A variant progerin expressed in HGPS, prelamin A does not appear to cause vascular smooth muscle loss, promote atherosclerosis or drive vascular aging.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Rationale: Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) results from abnormal lung development after preterm birth, with structural deficits at every respiratory tree level. BPD with lower airway disease is emerging as a clinically significant phenotype with increased mortality, and there is a significant knowledge gap in the molecular mechanisms whereby preterm birth disrupts normal airway development. Objectives: To develop a human model of lower airway disease after preterm birth and to characterize a molecular endotype of evolving BPD (eBPD) at baseline and in response to injury. Methods: We used a combination of an ex vivo organotypic Airway Epithelial Cell (AEC models) and well-characterized pathologic and transcriptomic patient samples for quantitative immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing analyses. Measurements and Main Results: Compared to AECs from healthy patients, eBPD-derived AECs have a molecular endotype of reduced proliferation, impaired differentiation to ciliated epithelium, and an expanded vimentin-positive population with a transcriptional shift toward stromal cell-associated genes. With hyperoxia exposure, eBPD-derived AECs exhibited a pronounced vimentin response ex vivo, which parallels the increased vimentin expression of airway cells observed in lung tissue from human infants with BPD. Conclusions: In this organotypic model of neonatal airway differentiation, we find that infants with eBPD have impaired differentiation, increased expression of vimentin, and concomitant loss of cilia, with an exaggerated increase in vimentin expression after hyperoxia injury, findings that mimic the effects of prematurity in airway cells in human patients. These data provide a foundation for future mechanistic studies interrogating the role of intermediate filaments in epithelial differentiation and repair.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Using a combined approach of formulation optimization and GI delivery site screening, we found that cationic SM-102 LNPs delivered gastrically achieved 7-fold higher pancreas delivery in rodents than intravenous neutral SM-102 LNPs.

We develop a force-dependent model of chromatin loop extrusion and investigate its mechanical consequences on chromosome organization using simulations and analytical theory. We show that loop extrusion alters the force-extension behavior of DNA in a non-monotonic manner: extrusion stiffens the chain at low forces but softens it at intermediate and high forces. Our model predicts hysteresis in pulling-recoiling cycles and out-of-equilibrium responses, consistent with recent single-chromosome stretching experiments.

Here, we present a novel strategy harnessing acute transplant rejection mechanisms by employing a recombinant oncolytic rVMG vector engineered to express the murine H-2Kk MHC class I alloantigen (rVMG-H-2Kk), thereby inducing tumor-specific antigenic mismatch responses. In vitro, rVMG-H-2Kk exhibited strong replication and cytolytic activity while inducing cell surface expression of both H-2Kk and endogenous H-2Kb, in addition to upregulation of antigen presentation genes ({beta}2-microglobulin, Tap1, and Tapbp). In two independent immunocompetent PDAC models, intratumoral and systemic delivery of rVMG-H-2Kk delayed tumor progression and prolonged survival. Multiplex immunohistochemistry and immunophenotyping revealed substantial TME remodeling, marked by increased effector T-cell infiltration, regulatory T-cell depletion, and reduced fibrosis. Spatial transcriptomics further showed compartment-specific immune activation and epithelial metabolic reprogramming, corroborating with enhanced tumor immunogenicity. Despite these effects, rVMG-H-2Kk also induced compensatory immunosuppressive pathways, including upregulation of antiviral response genes and immune checkpoint receptors such as PDL-2. Importantly, combination therapy with rVMG-H-2Kk and murine checkpoint blockade (anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4) drastically improved survival than checkpoint blockade alone. Strikingly, surviving mice resisted tumor rechallenge, indicating the establishment of durable antitumor memory. Collectively, these findings establish rVMG-H-2Kk as a novel immunotherapeutic platform capable of converting immune-cold tumors into immune-hot, sensitizing tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and establishing durable antitumor immunity in PDAC.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

This can be achieved by targeted activation of regulatory T and B cells via antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in a tolerogenic context.

Here, we investigate the biodistribution and splenic APC subset-specific uptake of rigid DSPC:DSPG:CHOL liposomes compared to flexible DOPC:DOPG:CHOL liposomes using high-parameter flow cytometry. We developed a panel enabling identification of rare splenic APC subsets involved in immune tolerance, including CD169 and MARCO marginal zone macrophages, red pulp macrophages, and conventional/plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Our findings confirm that rigid liposomes predominantly accumulate in the liver and spleen following IV injection, with negligible uptake in lymph nodes or lungs. Importantly, systemic distribution is significantly inhibited by subcutaneous administration, which is essential for tolerance induction. Among splenic APCs, macrophage subsets are major contributors to liposome uptake, though the liver remains the primary site of accumulation and may play a more dominant role in tolerance induction.

We uncover that SSA binds to SF3b through a metal-assisted enzymatic-like reaction, with specific binding site residues and a zinc finger ion actively promoting the chemical process. Namely, while the zinc ion activates the Cys-S nucleophile, a flanking Lys-Asp residues pair cooperatively activates the SSA epoxy warhead, increasing its susceptibility to be attacked by Cys-S nucleophile.

Here, we use single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to investigate how CBM1 of Trichoderma reesei Cel7A influences enzyme binding and motility on cellulose substrates of varying complexity. We compare wild-type Cel7A with a truncated variant lacking CBM1 (Cel7A{Delta}CBM) on bacterial cellulose (BC), phosphoric acid swollen cellulose (PASC), delignified milkweed cellulose (MWC), and holocellulose nanofibrils (hCNF). While both variants showed similar steady-state binding densities on BC and PASC, Cel7A{Delta}CBM exhibited reduced binding on MWC and hCNF, with the greatest reduction on the hemicellulose-rich hCNF. Alkali removal of hemicellulose partially restored Cel7A{Delta}CBM binding, suggesting a role for CBM1 in substrate navigation and productive binding sites recognition. Kinetic analyses revealed that CBM1 enables a rapid binding mode absent in the truncated variant. Comparisons with isolated CBM3 further showed that CBMs are capable of fast substrate association. These findings demonstrate that CBMs enhance cellulase-substrate interactions by accelerating binding, enabling navigation of the complex environment of plant cell walls.

M.; Cheung, K.", "abstract": "Understanding how light interacts with biomaterials is critical not only for therapeutic delivery in vivo but also for enabling emerging light-based fabrication methods such as volumetric bioprinting. In particular, optical characterization of photosensitive hydrogels like Gelatin Methacrylate (GelMA) provides foundational data for additive manufacturing of complex, tissue-engineered constructs with spatially controlled architecture. GelMA is a promising candidate for use as an injectable hydrogel for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair. This is primarily due to its highly tunable properties, allowing it to mimic tissue. Additionally, GelMA can be optically crosslinked. Optical simulations of this material within the spinal cord can inform whether the cross-linking of this material is feasible and uniform within a particular injury with a chosen exposure paradigm. These simulations require the optical properties of the tissues and materials of interest. However, the optical properties of GelMA have not been studied. The optical properties of GelMA were measured using a double integrating sphere setup and modelled with inverse adding doubling. We measured the absorption coefficient (a [mm^-1]), reduced scattering coefficient (s'[mm^-1]), and scattering anisotropy (g [unitless]) for GelMA hydrogels, and examined the effect on these properties when magnetically alignable microstructures were suspended in the hydrogel. We conducted Monte Carlo simulations using these optical properties to determine whether the GelMA hydrogels would be cross-linked under different illumination conditions within a representative spinal cord injury geometry. The depth of hydrogel cross-linking for this representative spinal cord injury geometry was experimentally validated. Overall, it was found that GelMA without rods has an a = 0.516 {+/-} 0.025 mm^-1, with insignificant scattering at 450 nm, GelMA with rods has an a = 0.588 {+/-} 0.018 mm^-1, s' = 0.196 {+/-} 0.024 mm^-1, and g = 0.906 {+/-} 0.014 at 450 nm. Additionally, it was observed that in fluid-filled lesions, external illumination is often sufficient to achieve uniform gel curing. In contrast, fibrotic lesions require an intraspinal approach to adequately deliver light throughout the lesion, although the dose distribution will be nonuniform. Finally, experimental results confirmed the simulation findings, showing that when exposing GelMA to 63.29 mW/cm^2 of 450 nm light, curing is uniform within the first 4 mm of gel and worsens with depth. These findings support the conclusion that larger volumes of photosensitive GelMA can be feasibly cured within the porcine spinal cord, but an intraspinal exposure will likely be required within human spinal tissue. These findings not only support the feasibility of in situ photopolymerization for SCI repair, but also provide critical optical parameters and validation approaches relevant to bioprinting systems.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Gangliosides being a class of structurally diverse and functionally varied glycolipids, can act both as a receptor as well as a ligand and therefore is established as a crucial player in several normal cellular processes. In certain diseases and in particular cancer select gangliosides are overexpressed often leading to disease manifestation. GM2-synthase the enzyme responsible for the formation of a pro-tumorigenic ganglioside GM2 is well reported to be over-expressed across various cancer tissues and cell lines. This over-expression of GM2-synthase has been linked with increased migration invasion and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) as well as induction of a local and systemic host immune suppression in cancer. Despite only a handful of studies demonstrating an epigenetic regulation underlying the transcriptional regulation of GM2-synthase (B4GalNT1) gene the detailed mechanism still remains unclear. Here we identified the total proteome associated with the GM2-synthase promoter through a modified CRISPR-dCas9 based proteome profiling approach by categorizing all the identified proteins leading to a detailed elucidation of the molecular drivers behind GM2-synthase transcription. While the previous study identified an acetylation-dependent de-repression of the transcription factor SP1 causing GM2-synthase activation the underlying molecular mechanism driving its activation wasnt clear. This study demonstrated that the histone acetyl transferase p300 acts as a pivotal factor which on one hand cause acetylation-mediated degradation of SP1 and on the other hand activates SMAD2/4 to have a direct positive impact on GM2 synthase gene transcription. We identified p300 to have an activator role in GM2 synthase gene transcription through knock out, knock down and over-expression experiments. Furthermore SP1 degradation, SMAD activation and their DNA binding patterns show the reciprocal role of p300 on SP1 and SMAD complexes. Altogether we have identified SMAD 2/4 as an activator complex p300 as a positive regulator and uncovered a critical p300-SMAD-SP1 regulatory axis in GM2-synthase transcriptional regulation.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Although genomic data confirm its multimeric role, in vivo evidence for H-H dimerization has been elusive. Here, unbiased pull-down sequencing uncovers a range of relaxed motifs that drive H-H dimerization, enabling systematic genome-wide analysis. We demonstrate that FoxP3 binds genomic DNA as both H-H dimers and multimers in Tregs, with H-H binding often seeding and stabilizing multimerization on adjacent TnG repeats, especially on shorter, suboptimal repeats.

We show that Pcads interact with the desmosomal cadherin Desmoglien-2 (Dsg2) on opposing cells, by mutually swapping {beta}-strands terminated by conserved Tryptophan residues. A key determinant of this trans heterophilic strand-swap dimerization is the flexibility of a hinge on the swapped {beta}-strands: stiffening this hinge reduces the likelihood of heterophilic strand-swap dimer formation. We demonstrate that while desmosome formation is impaired in cells that either lack classical cadherins or that express strand-swap deficient Pcad, introduction of strand-swap competent Pcad into these cells rescues desmosome assembly.

R.; Prieur, X.", "abstract": "Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases, with adipocyte dysfunction playing a central role. In individuals living with obesity, adipose tissue (AT) enters a state of metabolic inertia, reducing its capacity to store excess lipids and promoting ectopic lipid accumulation in non-adipose tissues - thereby contributing to cardiometabolic complications. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate lipid storage and mobilization in adipocytes - and how these are disrupted in obesity - is critical for addressing these complications. Generalized lipodystrophy, the most severe form of primary adipocyte dysfunction, is caused in approximately 50% of cases by mutations in the BSCL2 gene encoding Seipin, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein essential for lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and maintenance. Seipin also localizes to ER/mitochondria contact sites (MAM), where it regulates calcium exchange and mitochondrial function. This study aimed to determine whether Seipin s recruitment to MAM and ER/LD contact sites overlaps and to assess the consequences of Seipin dysfunction on membrane contact site (MCS) dynamics and adipocyte metabolism. Using in situ proximity ligation assays (PLA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we observed altered MCS involving the ER, LDs, and mitochondria in Seipin-deficient models. Functional assays revealed that Seipin knockdown impairs triglyceride transfer to LDs, an effect that was rescued by the MAM-reinforcing synthetic peptide, the Linker-ER-Mi. Further, we investigated how MCS remodeling influences adipocyte metabolic flexibility. Using TEM and PLA in both mouse AT and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, here, we show that lipid loading increases contacts involving the lipid droplet (LD), specifically ER/LD and mitochondria/LD (Mi/LD) contacts. However, lipid loading exerts opposite effects on MAM subtypes: oleic acid increases the MAM involving mitochondria in close contact with the LD, the MAM-LD, while decreasing the MAM involving cytosolic mitochondria, the classical MAM-CM contacts. Notably, this adaptive MCS remodeling was blunted in the AT of diet-induced obese mice. Genetic disruption of MCS in 3T3-L1 adipocytes led to altered lipid flux, impaired lipolysis, and reduced insulin signaling. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that MAM-LD contacts are central to adipocyte metabolic flexibility and lipid handling, and that their dysregulation in obesity may underlie the metabolic inflexibility characteristic of this condition.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

M.; Sigg, M.; Schneider, T.; Stuber, K.; Lehmann, J.; Jansen, J.; Stengel, F.; Marx, A.; Scheffner, M.", "abstract": "Lysine acetylation plays a prominent regulatory role in eukaryotic cells. Yet, determining the functional consequences of acetylation for a given protein represents a considerable challenge. For instance, lysine residues are subject to various posttranslational modifications, rendering interpretation of mutational studies difficult. The genetic code expansion technology enables site-specific incorporation of acetyllysine (AcK) into proteins, but the applicability of AcK is limited, as within cells, the acetyl group is removed by deacetylases. Here, we show that site-specific incorporation of the non-hydrolyzable AcK analog ketolysine (KeK) and the trifluoroacetyllysine (TFAcK) into ubiquitin closely resembles the structural and functional effects of AcK incorporation. Furthermore, AcK and KeK can be efficiently incorporated into the tumor suppressor p53 in cells. However, whereas AcK becomes deacetylated, KeK, and also partially TFAcK, remains stable. Accordingly, incorporation of KeK, but not AcK, affects p53-mediated transcription. Thus, we propose that KeK is the AcK surrogate of choice for studying acetylation of a given protein in cells. Moreover, we show that the trifluoro modification is a functional surrogate of AcK but with a different chemistry, leading to a distingushed enzymatic processing.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Exploration of the proxiOME of large subunit ribosomal proteins reveals Acl1 and Bcl1 as cooperating dedicated chaperones of Rpl1", "doi": "10.1101/2025.09.18.677003", "authors": "Favre, S.; Pillet, B.; Burchert, F.; Siva Sankar, D.; Mendez-Godoy, A.; Dengjel, J.; Bange, G.; Kressler, D.", "abstract": "The eukaryotic ribosome consists of four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and around 80 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins). Most r-proteins, due to their extensive interactions with rRNA, contain highly basic regions, which can predispose them to aggregation prior to their assembly. Accordingly, dedicated chaperones (DCs) and importins have been shown to play a crucial role in safeguarding newly synthesized r-proteins until their incorporation into pre-ribosomal particles. However, only relatively few DCs and interactions with importins have so far been identified for the 79 r-proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we systematically explored the physical proximities of all r-proteins of the large 60S subunit by TurboID-based proximity labelling. This approach revealed importins and potential novel DCs within the proxiOME of several r-proteins. We provide evidence for a direct interaction of Kap119/Nmd5 with the r-protein Rpl30 (eL30), of Kap121/Pse1 with Rpl38 (eL38), and of Kap114 with both Rpl6 (eL6) and Rpl40 (eL40). Notably, the two previously uncharacterized proteins Acl1 (Ycr051w) and Bcl1 (Ynl035c) were found in the proxiOME of the universally conserved Rpl1 (uL1). While Acl1 appears to be a fungi-specific protein, the human orthologue of Bcl1, WDR89, was found in the proxiOME of the human Rpl1 orthologue RPL10A, suggesting that Bcl1 carries out an evolutionarily conserved function. We show that both Acl1 and Bcl1 are direct interaction partners of Rpl1 and that they have the capacity to form a trimeric complex with Rpl1 in vitro. We also report the crystal structure of a minimal Acl1-Rpl1 complex, which reveals how the ankyrin repeats of Acl1 interact with the second domain of Rpl1. Moreover, we have performed a detailed mutational analysis, based on the Acl1-Rpl1 crystal structure and the predicted Bcl1-Rpl1 structure, to verify the relevance of the interaction-mediating surfaces on Rpl1 and Acl1. In vivo, concomitant absence of Acl1 and Bcl1 leads to a synergistic growth defect and affects the subunit-joining capacity of the produced 60S subunits, presumably due to the reduced incorporation of Rpl1 into nuclear pre-60S subunits. Interestingly, both Acl1 and Bcl1 contain a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) at their C-terminal extremity. While the exact mechanism of Acl1 import remains to be established, we show that the NLS of Bcl1 corresponds to a Kap104-interacting PY-NLS. Notably, only simultaneous absence of both NLSs abolishes the nuclear accumulation of Acl1 and Bcl1, suggesting that they can be co-imported into the nucleus as a trimeric Acl1-Rpl1-Bcl1 complex. Taken together, our data indicate that Acl1 and Bcl1 may function as cooperating DCs of Rpl1 that assure the safe nuclear transfer and efficient loading of Rpl1 onto pre-60S subunits. In addition, and besides permitting the identification of DCs and importins, our TurboID-based proximity labelling screen also proved to be highly suitable for the visualization of both transient and stable neighbourhoods of r-proteins on pre-60S and mature 60S subunits, altogether making this data set a rich resource for studying many potentially exciting physical proximities of large subunit r-proteins along their entire life cycle.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Here we establish profiling of terminating ribosomes in mammalian cells and report a wide range of ribosome pausing at individual stop codons. We identify a sequence motif upstream of the stop codon that contributes to termination pausing, which was confirmed by massively paralleled reporter assays. Unexpectedly, lack of termination pausing increases the chance of stop codon slippage, generating proteins with mixed C-terminal extensions. We demonstrate that the sequence-dependent termination pausing is a result of post-decoding mRNA scanning by the 3 end of 18S rRNA. We further observe tissue-specific termination pausing that correlates with the stoichiometry of Rps26, which constrains mRNA:rRNA interaction. Thus, termination pausing represents a translational signature associated with mRNA sequence contexts, ribosome heterogeneity, and cell type-specific translational control.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Persistent fibroblast activation drives tissue fibrosis, yet how mechanical and inflammatory cues are integrated to promote this aberrant behavior remains unclear. Using a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based hydrogel platform to model normal and fibrotic lung mechanics, we examine the roles of Piezo1 and cadherin-11 (CDH11), both implicated in M2 macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk during pulmonary fibrosis progression, in interleukin (IL)-6-mediated fibroblast activation. While both Piezo1 and CDH11 expression increase in activated fibroblasts, blocking IL-6 signaling decreases CDH11, but not Piezo1, expression. Instead, Piezo1 activity promotes nuclear accumulation of the calcium-dependent transcription factor NFAT1. While Piezo1 inhibition moderately reduces CDH11 expression, it does not prevent fibroblast activation as measured by spreading and type I collagen expression, whereas CDH11 knockout suppresses fibroblast activation metrics, reduces Piezo1 expression, and decreases IL-6 secretion in both fibroblast only and fibroblast-M2 macrophage co-cultures. Furthermore, CDH11 levels increase in parallel with progressive fibroblast activation, highlighting its role in promoting this pro-fibrotic phenotype. Together, these findings underscore a previously unrecognized signaling axis in which CDH11 serves as a key mediator of sustained fibroblast activation, coordinating mechanical and inflammatory cues, and highlight CDH11 as a potential therapeutic target in pulmonary fibrosis.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Cellular motility relies on the dynamic turnover of actin filaments, which treadmill through continuous polymerization at the barbed end and disassembly at the pointed end. Yet, the underlying physical principles remain poorly understood. A long-standing challenge has been experimentally reconstituting stable, persistent treadmilling leading to higher-order actin organization. Here, we reconstitute a minimal in vitro system, in which phase-separated condensates of zyxin and VASP balance cofilin-driven disassembly to enable persistent actin treadmilling. The condensates crosslink filaments into dynamic bundles while promoting barbed-end polymerization. The localized stabilization based on condensate-mediated bundling competes against the activity of cofilin and CAP1, enabling selective disassembly at pointed ends and recycling of monomers. To elucidate the physical basis underlying this emergent behavior, we complement our experiments with agent-based simulations that quantitatively recapitulate key experimental findings. This combined approach demonstrates that robust treadmilling requires an optimal phase separation strength to maintain high local concentration while preserving condensate fluidity. A weakened phase separation fails to stabilize the bundles, whereas overly cohesive condensates impede filament dynamics. Experimental reconstitution and theoretical modeling together reveal a physical mechanism by which the material properties of multivalent protein condensates govern cytoskeletal turnover and suggest a general design principle by which biomolecular condensates can spatiotemporally organize cytoskeletal structures.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

E.; Zuend, C. F.; Goodman, W. A.; Koyuturk, M.; Brubaker, D.", "abstract": "Background: Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent disease characterized by the presence of endometrial-like tissue growing outside the uterus. The molecular and clinical heterogeneity of endometriosis complicate diagnostic and treatment options -- diagnostic delays of seven to ten years are common and therapies often lack long-term efficacy. Estrogen signaling and estrogen receptor beta (ER{beta}) expression is thought to be increased in endometriosis, contributing to increased cell proliferation in lesions. The ER{beta} dominance hypothesis is a prevailing hypothesis in the field, setting ER{beta} as a high-priority therapeutic target. If effectively modulated, ER{beta} could be the first therapy to directly target lesion biology, rather than only managing symptoms. Objective(s): We aimed to characterize ER{beta} expression in endometriosis by cell type and evaluate its therapeutic relevance, primarily assessing the validity of the ER{beta} dominance hypothesis. Study Design: We reanalyzed scRNAseq data from eight previously published studies. Our final filtered dataset included 557,061 cells, the largest endometriosis single cell atlas ever constructed. We quantified gene expression levels of ESR1 and ESR2, which encode ER and ER{beta} respectively, across each tissue and cell type, to identify cell-type specific drivers of ESR2/ER{beta} expression across diseased and healthy tissues. To characterize the differences between cells that uniquely express ESR1 versus those that uniquely express ESR2, we performed differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analyses. Results: Count and distribution analyses revealed no significant ESR2/ER{beta} dominance in any cell or tissue type by Fishers Exact Tests and Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests. Differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analyses suggest distinct roles of each estrogen receptor isoform. Conclusion(s): Overall, our results argue against a simplified model of ER{beta} dominance and instead propose a dual-isoform and cell and tissue-specific framework for understanding estrogen receptor signaling in endometriosis. These findings hold important implications for future therapeutic strategies. Specifically, treatments that target ER{beta} alone may fail to account for the functional role and relative abundance of ER. In the future, therapeutic approaches that consider isoform-specific, tissue-specific, and cell-specific expression patterns may prove most effective in reducing recurrence and improving outcomes for patients.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Traditional CSD induction methods for animal studies have included pinprick, concentrated potassium chloride (KCl) application, and electrical stimulation. These methods are invasive and can cause injury to the cortex. Recently, a non-invasive approach using optogenetics has become available, but requires the use of transgenic mice or transfection of an optogene, which limits its wide adoption. Here, we describe a novel approach using olfactory bulb needle insertion in rodents to induce CSD. We also included KCl-induced CSDs as a comparator in the same mice. Olfactory bulb pinprick resulted in CSDs on every attempt (n = 18/18) as confirmed with optical intrinsic signal imaging. Histological analysis revealed that needle disruption in the caudal olfactory bulb, which is continuous with the cerebral cortex, may account for the propagation of CSD from the olfactory bulb to the cortex. Olfactory bulb pinprick reliably induces CSD and is non-invasive with respect to cortex. The approach may prove to be useful in rodent studies where maintenance of cortical integrity is important.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Deletion of negative T-cell regulators, such as PTPN2, a key inhibitor of TCR and cytokine signaling, represents a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy of CAR-T cells. While transfer of PTPN2 knockout (KO) T cells has demonstrated antitumor benefits in murine models, its impact on human-derived CAR-T cells and, importantly, the associated in vivo efficacy and toxicity remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that PTPN2-KO human CD19 CAR-T cells exhibit enhanced cytokine production, cytotoxicity, TCR and CAR affinity and signaling, leading to superior in vitro elimination of leukemic cells with low CD19 expression. To assess in vivo efficacy and toxicity, we performed a dose-escalation study using a non-human primate (NHP) model of B-cell-targeting CD20 CAR-T cell therapy. We demonstrated that PTPN2-KO CD20 CAR-T cells exhibited superior in vivo expansion and B-cell depletion compared to WT CAR-T cells, in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest dose level, CAR-T expansion was associated with increased toxicities, particularly ICANS, compared to PTPN2 WT CD20 CAR-T cells driven by enhanced CNS-infiltration. Transcriptional profiling revealed a dominant effector and proliferative signature, with cytotoxic CNS-infiltrating CD8+ PTPN2-KO CAR-T cells implicated in ICANS pathogenesis.

Leveraging the non-destructive, single-molecule, and strand-specific nature of our data, we discover an intrinsic asymmetry in nucleosome positioning patterns and organization between lagging- and leading-strand chromatin created by the yeast replisome. This asymmetry is only partially restored upon addition of chromatin assembly factors involved in de novo histone deposition and the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler Isw1a, implying that other regulatory factors must resolve this asymmetry in cells.

To improve volumetric blood detection in large muscles, without relying on the capillary density of skin, a flexible PPG sensor was developed. The sensor included multiple spacing of illuminating infrared (IR) light emitting diodes (LEDs) and a single IR photodetector. This arrangement was expected to enable detection of blood volume changes at variable distances from the sensor face, potentially at much longer depths then feasible with skin-mounted PPG devices. IR bench phantoms simulating a large blood vessel embedded in IR absorbing, tissue-mimicking rubber were developed and used to determine the sensor performance in vitro.

Despite many past efforts, the active/open state has not yet been fully resolved at atomic resolutions. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the NMDAR activation, computer modeling and simulation are instrumental in providing detailed information about the dynamics and energetics of the receptor in various functional states. In this study, we started from a previously built open-state model of a truncated NMDAR, and then explored its energetics and dynamics with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation (total simulation time is 5.6 {micro}s). Based on the MD simulation, we employed an array of analysis tools to study the fluctuations/motions at the levels of individual residues, the channel pore, and the global structure, and identified a dynamic network of polar/nonpolar interactions between residues. Furthermore, we used machine learning to identify key interactions and residues relevant to channel opening/closing and validated them with evolutionary conservation grades and annotations of disease mutations in NMDAR. Taken together, our modeling and simulation provided rich structural and dynamic information which will guide functional studies of the activation of this key receptor.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

These include universal archetypes shared across tissues and tissue-specific archetypes shaped by local context. We find that tissues align along a continuous axis of archetype distributions, from metabolically active to barrier organs, reflecting coordinated functional adaptation. Using ligand-receptor enrichment mapping, we reveal task-specific crosstalk across cell types, suggesting that intercellular communication underlies supportive division of labor.

C.; Zawisza, K. A.; Brow, D. A.", "abstract": "Hrp1/Nab4 is an essential nuclear RNA-binding protein that was first identified in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a cleavage and polyadenylation factor for mRNAs, CF1B, but was later shown to promote termination of some short, noncoding transcripts via the \"NNS\" termination pathway. Hrp1 binds (UA)n repeats found in both mRNA 3'-UTRs and short noncoding RNA terminators, but its function in 3'-end formation is not fully understood. Our past microarray transcriptome analysis of the heat-sensitive hrp1-7 allele suggested Hrp1 functions in antitermination of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) on protein-coding genes. The hrp1-7 allele has four substitutions and one, M191T, was shown to be primarily responsible for NNS terminator readthrough. Here we show that Hrp1-7 protein has a four-fold and Hrp1-M191T a two-fold decreased affinity for (UA)5 in vitro. We used nanopore direct RNA sequencing to assess the transcriptome-wide effects of hrp1-7 and hrp1-M191T, which identified new examples of Hrp1-dependent small nucleolar RNA terminators and mRNA attenuators (regulatory terminators in the 5'-UTR and ORF). For some genes, including HRP1, attenuated transcript reads outnumber the corresponding mRNA reads in exponentially growing wild-type cells. We also observed widespread changes in mRNA polyA site selection. In the hrp1-M191T strain the polyA site shifts are mostly downstream, while in the hrp1-7 strain upstream and downstream shifts are more similar in frequency. Our results are consistent with a model in which some of the four substitutions in hrp1-7 weaken the affinity of Hrp1 for the RNAP II elongation complex, while others interfere with its recognition of specific sequences in nascent transcripts that would normally promote its release from the elongation complex.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

However, such closures often rely on limited data, because fishing impacts on habitat are rarely quantified and fine-scale habitat maps are often unavailable. In this paper we develop fine-scale species distribution models for coral and sponge habitats and demonstrate a quantitative risk assessment framework for habitat impacts from bottom longline trap and hook fisheries, using the British Columbia Sablefish fishery as a case study. We estimate a 4% (95%CI: 2-7%) reduction in coastwide sponge habitats due to Sablefish fishing from 1965 to 2024, compared to pre-fishery levels. Habitat status at finer spatial scales of 1 km2 shows similar trends to the coastwide aggregate status, with habitat declines less than 10% for 99% of fishing grounds. Our analysis provides fine-scale information on habitat distribution and the impacts from Sablefish longline trap and hook fishing gear, providing key information for conservation planning and fisheries management. Our risk assessment approach provides quantitative metrics (relative benthic status) for ecosystem objectives focused on fishery impacts on habitat. Such habitat metrics can be incorporated into fisheries management strategy evaluation, allowing resource managers to compare performance of alternative strategies against a broader suite of sustainability objectives that include habitat, fish stocks, and fisheries catch.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we examine how integrating gene drives with established pest control methods, such as pesticide application and sterile-male release, can mitigate spillover risk. We develop optimal control models to identify cost-effective treatment strategies that minimize total eradication costs, accounting for actual investments and potential damage from spillover. We show that pesticides are most cost-effective at the intermediate stage of eradication when gene drives have already slowed population growth but do not yet substantially suppress the population. For sterile-male release, however, we observe two distinct types of optimal strategies, the choice of which depends on parameter values: intensive early-stage releases or mild later-stage releases. Using established pest controls also relaxes requirements to gene drive design, favoring milder suppressive effects as the treatment intensifies.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

In a genome-wide association study in a European maize landrace we identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) that affected the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm) in field experiments. In a forward genetic approach, we focused on a QTL on chromosome 10, explaining a large proportion of the genetic variance for Fv/Fm in growth stages V4 (35%) and V6 (47%), for genetic dissection and candidate gene discovery. Integrating molecular and physiological information we show that allelic variation at the gene encoding LIGHT HARVESTING CHLOROPHYLL A/B BINDING PROTEIN6 (LHCB6), a component of the photosystem II (PSII) light-harvesting complex (LHCII) antenna, underlies the variation in Fv/Fm. We demonstrate that the allelic variation results from a hAT transposon insertion at lhcb6 and is associated with differential accumulation of the LHCII antenna components LHCB6 and LHCB3, leading to differences in non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and plant biomass accumulation. Based on proteomic analyses we propose candidate genes that compensate the unfavorable effects caused by impaired LHCII antenna assembly. Our work provides novel insights into the function of lhcb6 in the context of LHCII antenna assembly and demonstrates the value of natural variation in landraces for the understanding and genetic improvement of complex photosynthetic processes.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Common sparse approximations, such as banded matrices, come at the expense of losing the positive semi-definite (PSD) property, a critical quality that ensures numerical stability of many downstream analyses. Conversely, methods that guarantee a PSD approximation, like block-diagonal approaches, require coarse approximations of the LD structure. In this work, we present a novel method to approximate an LD matrix with a sparse, banded matrix that is guaranteed to be PSD while preserving the correlation structure within the band. This is done via a reformulation of the nearest correlation matrix problem using the Cholesky decomposition, which implicitly imposes the PSD property in a highly scalable parallel approach.

Here, we dissect the impact of IRF1 on gene regulation in HeLa cells, by targeted knockout (KO) or overexpression (OE) of IRF1. IRF1 KO did not impair interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression regulation upon IFN-{beta} stimulation, but partially diminished IFN-g induced gene regulation. IRF1 KO did show a homeostatic role in basal gene abundance, including increasing the abundance of some antiviral genes. RNA-seq analysis showed altered expression of both ISGs and immune signaling genes, implicating IRF1 as a dual regulator that fine-tunes gene abundance through both activation and repression. IRF1 OE induced potent antiviral protection in the absence of exogenous IFN, mediated by type I IFN secretion, particularly of IFN- subtypes. This paracrine effect was confirmed by transcriptomics, cytokine profiling, and mass spectrometry, and was functional even in JAK1-deficient or Ruxolitinib-treated cells but not type I IFN receptor KO cells, suggesting the involvement of non-canonical signaling pathways. Hierarchical clustering of RNA-seq data revealed distinct IFN-independent gene clusters activated or repressed by IRF1, including pathways related to adaptive immunity and T cell function. Using protein-binding microarrays and predictive modeling, we mapped IRF1 binding across promoters and validated functional motifs in the IFIT2 gene promoter by a reporter assay.

This study thus compared the dynamics of the most injured hamstrings muscle, biceps femoris long head (BFLH), for 14 participants (8 male and 6 female) performing the NHE and running between 4 and 8 m/s. Methods: We used motion capture experiments and musculoskeletal simulation to quantify muscle fiber lengths and velocities, and muscle force, work, and power during the NHE and running. Results: Our results show that peak muscle forces are greater during high-speed running (7.5 to 8 m/s) than the NHE, and that high-speed running also features longer muscle fiber lengths and higher muscle fiber lengthening velocities (p < 0.05). Negative muscle work was significantly greater during the NHE compared to running at all speeds (p < 0.001) because of the greater change in muscle fiber lengths during the NHE (p < 0.001). In contrast, peak negative muscle power was significantly lower during the NHE compared to running at 5 m/s and above (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Our analysis reveals dramatic differences in the biomechanical demands of the NHE and running on the hamstrings muscles.

Specifically, we inject neighbourhood structure of the observed dataset encoded as affinity matrices into the prior of embeddings through exponential tilting, and use this prior to penalise the configuration of the latent embeddings based on the discrepancy between the neighbourhood structures in the data spaces and in the latent space.

A major challenge during outbreaks is not only detecting antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), but also unmasking their pathogen hosts and genomic context, as ARGs alone do not fully capture AMR risk. Pathogen identification is often essential for guiding effective treatment. While culture-based methods remain the diagnostic gold standard, they are slow and sometimes impractical. Faster metagenomic (mNGS) tools typically detect either ARGs, taxonomy, or genomic context, but rarely all three, resulting in fragmented surveillance. Existing k-mer classifiers like Kraken2 and CLARK, designed for general taxonomy, often perform poorly on AMR-specific sequences. We introduce CARD k-mers, the first tool built to jointly predict species-level taxonomy and genomic context (plasmid vs. chromosome) for ARGs in short metagenomic reads. Integrated with the Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database (CARD), CARD k-mers enables rapid, context-aware assignment of ARGs to their likely pathogen and genomic element origin. In benchmarking with 103,456 in-silico pathogen-specific AMR alleles, CARD k-mers outperformed Kraken2 and CLARK by 10.85% and 15.2%, respectively, and correctly classified the genomic context of 4,590 chromosome- and 176 plasmid-specific ARGs.

We find that even small, idealized TMBs challenge classical protein design workflows: sequences optimized solely for thermodynamic stability misfold and aggregate, preventing membrane insertion. Instead of bulk hydrophobicity, aggregation and beta-sheet propensity emerge as key determinants of membrane association. By designing better folding variants of a synthetic TMB, we demonstrate that suppressing aggregation-prone intermediates through local destabilization of beta-strands (\"negative design\") significantly improves folding efficiency. Strikingly, even substitutions typically considered highly destabilizing, such as prolines or polar threonines exposed to the bilayer core, can improve folding when strategically positioned, without significantly compromising thermodynamic stability.

TAMs can be predominant cells in the TME, able to promote cancer cell proliferation, resistance to treatments and immunosuppression. Inactivating these TAMs in tumors by their depletion or their repolarization into a specific anti-tumor, inflammatory phenotype constitutes a significant challenge in immuno-oncology. Several tools and methods to target TAMs have been proposed but they often show low specificity for pro-tumoral macrophages and target myeloid cells too broadly. This research area is therefore in full expansion and warrants the development of appropriate study models. Given the current global effort to reduce the use of in vivo approaches, developing in vitro models that mimic the behavior of TAMs in the TME has become a priority. In this study, we focused on targeting pro-tumoral TAMs in a simple in vitro model recapitulating cancer cell proliferation and TAMs specific phenotype. We developed a 3D model consisting of cancer cells and pro-tumoral macrophages, in which these macrophages promote tumor cell proliferation, maintaining an immunosuppressive phenotype.

K.; Zhou, X.; Chen, S.-h.; Agrawal, P.", "abstract": "Background: Based on our previous study, we have identified ZNF180, a zinc finger protein, as a pro-tumorigenic regulator in primary melanoma and a marker for poor prognosis. Herein, we report that ZNF180-regulated pathway, hence ZNF180-regulome, underlies resistance towards immune checkpoint inhibitions (ICIs). Methods: To investigate regulatory roles of ZNF180 to confer these immune suppressive phenotypes, we performed ZNF180 knock-down in melanoma cells in vitro with different genetic backgrounds, namely A375 (BRAF-mutant) and SKMEL147 (NRAS-mutant) cells, and performed RNA- and ATAC-sequencing. We performed integrative analysis of RNA- and ATAC-sequencing data with publicly available sequencing data from ICI-treated cohorts to construct comprehensive model of ZNF180-regulome and its impacts on immune microenvironment. Further, we performed ZNF180 silencing in immune competent Yumm1.7 murine model to confirm the changes in immune microenvironments. Results: ZNF180-regulome was predictive of ICI responses in independent bulk sequencing cohorts, and ZNF180+ tumors persisted after the therapy with immune-suppressive features such as MHC-I loss and CD155 expressions, the primary ligand to TIGIT inhibitory receptor. Further, ZNF180 silencing revealed its regulations on AP-1 transcription factors to drive melanoma reprogramming towards de-differentiated MITFlowAXLhigh cells, an established melanoma subtypes associated with recurrence and ICI resistance. In tandem, we observed that ZNF180+ tumor neighborhood significantly excluded with CD4 T-cells in metastatic tumor, and its silencing in immune competent murine model increased CD4 helper T-cell infiltrations with significant tumor regression in vivo. Conclusion: Collectively, these results indicate ZNF180 is a tumor intrinsic regulator of melanoma plasticity to drive de-differentiated phenotypes with immune-suppressive features including loss of immunogenicity, T-cell inhibitory signals through TIGIT/CD155 checkpoint and exclusion of CD4 helper T-cells. As ZNF180-regulome manifests in non-metastatic melanoma in contrast to the current focus of standard-of-care ICI on the metastatic disease, these results establish ZNF180-regulome as a biomarker and novel therapeutic avenue for early-stage, non-metastatic melanoma to intervene ICI resistance.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Prior work including our own has demonstrated that myeloid immune cells are highly responsive to cholesterol fluctuations and to proteins involved in cholesterol regulation. However, the specific roles of Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1, or NR5A2), a key transcriptional regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, within myeloid cells remains largely undefined. Interestingly, LRH-1 mRNA levels are reduced in both breast and ovarian tumors compared to normal tissue. Its elevated expression within tumors is associated with increased survival time. These clinical correlations prompted us to explore the role of LRH-1 in myeloid cells particularly in the context of breast and ovarian cancer progression. Initial analyses confirmed LRH-1 expression in various myeloid cell types, with particularly high levels in neutrophils. We therefore focused on how LRH-1 influences neutrophil behaviors relevant to cancer, including migration, NETosis, phagocytosis, and interactions with T cells. Small molecule ligands for LRH-1 regulated neutrophil migration towards cancer cells. Phagocytosis was also regulated by LRH-1 small molecule ligands, the extent being dependent on type of bait (e. coli vs. cancer cells). In T cell co-cultures, neutrophils pretreated with an LRH-1 agonist promoted greater T cell expansion - particularly in CD4+; cells - while LRH-1 inhibition suppressed this response. Moreover, LRH-1 activation reduced NETosis, while treatment with an antagonist or inverse agonist enhanced NETosis. Treatment of mice with an inverse agonist of LRH-1 increased the growth of 4T1 and E0771 mammary tumors. Given prior evidence that neutrophils contribute to the recurrence of dormant lesions, we further examined the role of LRH-1 in this context. Mice harboring dormant D2.0R mammary cancer lesions treated with an LRH-1 inverse agonist exhibited earlier tumor recurrence and enhanced metastatic progression compared to vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, treatment with BL001, a small chemical LRH-1 agonist, delayed recurrence in D2.0R-grafted mice. Collectively, these findings reveal that LRH-1 is a novel regulator of neutrophil-driven immune responses within the tumor microenvironment. LRH-1 thus remerges as a promising therapeutic target to suppress metastasis or prevent recurrence in breast cancer.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Using genetically engineered mouse models, pancreatic stellate cell (PSC) and cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) co-culture systems, single-nucleus multiomics, and human PDAC models, we show that tumoral loss of ATM serine/threonine kinase drives CAFs toward SMA+ myofibroblastic differentiation, independently of P53 status. These myCAFs, in turn, promote cancer aggressiveness and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, ATM deficiency increases reactive oxygen species and contractility signaling, enhancing TGF-{beta}1 secretion. Pharmacological TGF-{beta} inhibition reverses myCAF differentiation, sensitizes tumors to chemotherapy, and impairs tumor progression in both murine and human ATM-null models.

To overcome this critical clinical compatibility challenge, we developed an innovative tri-compartment, chemistry-driven probe design strategy. Specifically, we developed a congeneric library of near infrared (NIR) water soluble fluorescent probes incorporating: (1) a glutamic acid-urea-lysine (EuK) ligand targeting prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA); (2) a NIR heptamethine cyanine fluorophore optimized for enhanced PSMA binding via secondary binding sites interactions; and (3) distinct PK modulators residing outside the PSMA binding pocket to promote rapid off-target tissue clearance. While molecular docking scores, photophysical properties and live-cell staining results showed similar overall performance, probes bearing PK modulators produced stronger tumor-specific fluorescence in vivo than the control lacking a PK modulator. This effort enabled identification of a lead probe with robust tumor targeting and accelerated off-target clearance, providing optimal tumor-specific signal and contrast in a timeframe, fully compatible with robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) timelines.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Here, using human iPSC-derived neurons and a large multi-omics dataset of ALS/FTD patients, we demonstrate that TDP-43 pathology induces the inclusion of an in-frame cryptic exon in human G3BP1. The resulting CRYPTIC G3BP1 protein contains an additional 10 amino acids within the highly conserved NTF2L domain, which acts as a dominant negative and disrupts stress granule dynamics. We further show that cryptic exon inclusion in G3BP1 upon TDP-43 loss is enriched in neurons.

Accordingly, robust defense is essential but must involve minimal physiologic disruption. Airspace macrophages (AMs) protect lung surfaces while also maintaining tissue integrity through non-inflammatory homeostatic responses in health. However, in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), AMs contribute to emphysematous alveolar destruction through mechanisms that are poorly understood. We hypothesized that damaging effects of AMs in emphysema result from loss of mechanisms that normally restrain homeostatic AMs. We found that Siglec-F, a common marker of AMs, exerts suppressive effects on tissue resident AMs (RAMs), thereby supporting alveolar integrity in mouse lungs during health and in a model of elastase-induced alveolar destruction. Siglec-F-deficient mice exhibited decreased alveolar numbers at baseline, and they had worsened alveolar damage after elastase challenge that was unexpectedly RAM-mediated. Transcriptomic profiling revealed dysregulation of key pathways involved in tissue remodeling and repair, including extracellular matrix degradation, TGF-{beta} signaling, and phagocytosis. These findings uncover previously unrecognized roles for RAMs and Siglec-F in preserving alveolar integrity.

In females, dosage compensation is achieved through X chromosome inactivation (XCI), initiated by upregulation of the long non-coding RNA Xist, which spreads in cis, recruiting chromatin modifiers to silence gene expression on one X chromosome. Here, we conducted a forward genetic screen and identified X-encoded Host Cell Factor 1 (HCFC1), a member of the COMPASS H3K4 methyltransferase complex, as a dose-dependent XCI-activator. HCFC1 loss results in genome-wide reduction of H3K4me3 at specific regulatory elements and downregulation of nearby genes, including Xist. We show that HCFC1 and YY1 are co-recruited genome-wide to gene regulatory elements. Mass spectrometry analysis confirmed an interaction of HCFC1 and YY1 and uncovered the Integrator complex as another prominent YY1 partner. YY1 depletion results in genome-wide loss of Integrator recruitment at gene regulatory elements and reduced expression of nearby genes, including Xist cis-regulatory genes Jpx and Ftx.

Using these reporters combined with long-read sequencing approaches, we find that L1 retrotransposition intermediates can recombine with distal DNA breaks to generate chromosomal rearrangements. We also find that two distinct L1 insertion intermediates can recombine with each other to generate chromosomal rearrangements. Both types of rearrangements depend on L1-encoded ORF2p endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. Using these reporters, we discover that L1 retrotransposition-mediated rearrangements are robustly induced when the recombining sequences share homology and that their formation requires the homologous recombination factor BRCA1.

To test this idea, we directly visualized the dynamics of PolA/D at active replication forks via single-molecule imaging in Xenopus nuclear extracts. Surprisingly, we find that neither PolA nor PolD is stably tethered to the eukaryotic replisome.

WGD is sensed indirectly due to the presence of extra centrosomes, which activate the PIDDosome to induce a p53-dependent G1-arrest. Here we uncouple WGD from centrosome amplification and show that p53 still arrests tetraploid cells, but via the mitotic stopwatch; a p53/53BP1/USP28-dependent pathway that causes G1-arrest following an extended mitotic delay. Mitotic timing is unaffected by WGD, but the threshold mitotic delay needed to invoke a G1-arrest is reduced. This sensitivity to the stopwatch mechanism is not associated with altered levels of mitotic stopwatch components, but instead, is associated with enhanced p21 concentrations prior to mitosis. Similar effects are observed in diploid cells treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors to double their size, implicating G1 delays and cell size as key determinants of stopwatch sensitivity. This ability of the mitotic stopwatch to arrest proliferation after increases to genome or cell size has important implications for the progression and treatment of cancer.

Here, we show that titan cells developed from diploid strains predominantly produce diploid daughter cells with haploid daughters observed infrequently. We further demonstrate that meiosis-specific genes, including DMC1 and SPO11, are critical for stable inheritance of a diploid genome in the daughter cells. Specifically, deletion of these genes in a heterozygous diploid background results in: 1) titan cells with a significantly reduced capacity to produce daughter cells; 2) increased phenotypic variation among daughter cells produced by the titan cells, including traits that could be relevant to cell growth and viability; and 3) daughter cells produced by the titan cells exhibiting high levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and aneuploidy, suggested elevated genome instability.

Overall, across five methylation clocks and two blood-derived and one saliva-derived tissues, moderate to strong associations between chronological age and methylation ages were observed. Moreover, PBMC methylation age values correlate more strongly with BC values (Spearman r = 0.66 to 0.87), whereas saliva showed weaker correlations with either form of blood-derived measures (Spearman r = 0.25 to 0.69) although still moderate to strong magnitudes. Saliva demonstrated significantly older methylation ages across four of five clocks, whereas PBMC and BC did not differ.

This work aimed to enhance the therapeutic properties of DGL13K by using targeted modifications to increase antimicrobial potency and decrease toxicity, as determined by hemolysis. DGL13K derivatives were synthesized and tested, involving amino acid substitutions, stereochemical alterations, and N-terminal functionalization with polyethylene glycol (PEG) or myristoylate. While some modifications altered bacterial specificity and reduced hemolytic activity, none of the tested alterations resulted in a substantial overall improvement compared to the parent DGL13K sequence. Furthermore, the antibacterial efficacy of DGL13K and its variants was significantly inhibited in the presence of 50% serum, suggesting limitations for systemic applications. The findings suggest that the DGL13K sequence, derived from an evolutionarily selected protein, is already highly optimized.

While they have revolutionized our quantitative understanding of tissue architecture, these technologies generate large and high dimensional datasets encompassing tens of thousands of genes recorded at tens of thousands of spatial locations, requiring efficient automated methods for their analysis. In this study we introduce joint spatial PCA (jsPCA), a novel, fast, scalable and interpretable method for the automatic identification of spatial domains and variable genes in multi-slice and multi-sample spatial transcriptomics data. jsPCA relies on a simple mathematical formulation of a spatial covariance defined as the product of the gene expression covariance with the spatial autocorrelation. The principal components of this spatial covariance yield a biologically meaningful low-dimensional representation. From this representation, we can derive spatial domains by simple clustering. In addition, spatially variable genes can be identified directly from the principal components coefficients. Moreover, this approach enables the joint representation of multiple slices and samples, a frequent experimental setting. This joint representation is obtained without spatial alignment by computing common principal components via joint diagonalization of the set of spatial covariance matrices obtained for each slice. By leveraging sparsity and non-convex optimization on manifold, jsPCA leads to computing time in the order of seconds to minutes, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. We benchmarked jsPCA on the Visium 10x dataset of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the Stereo-seq MOSTA dataset of mouse embryonic development against 10 state-of-the-art methods.

A key observation was that EZH2i displayed variable sensitivities in combination therapy, which could not be explained solely by loss of lysine 27 trimethylation on histone H3 (H3K27me3), the most commonly studied EZH2 product. This led us to perform a comprehensive pharmacologic screen of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) antagonists. Here, we show that compounds targeting both EZH2 and its interchangeable catalytic subunit, EZH1, achieved superior TSG re-expression when combined with DNMTi. Integrative proteomic and epigenomic analyses revealed that EZH1/2 inhibitors reduce all three H3K27 methylation states, whereas EZH2-selective inhibitors preserve EZH1-dependent H3K27me1 at deeply Polycomb-repressed genomic regions. Notably, H3K27me1 loss coincided with deposition of p300/CBP-dependent lysine 27 acetylation on histone H3 (H3K27ac), which proved essential for TSG re-expression. Paradoxically, blocking p300/CBP activity further enhanced the growth-inhibitory effects of combined DNMT and EZH1/2 inhibition. Mechanistically, we show that EZH1/2 inhibition redistributes p300/CBP activity, reducing H3K27ac from oncogenic loci and redirecting it to bivalent regions that enable TSG re-expression. Collectively, these findings reveal a coordinated role for EZH1-dependent H3K27me1 and DNA methylation in sustaining oncogenic transcriptional programs and provide strong rationale for advancing dual EZH1/2 inhibitors for combination epigenetic cancer therapy.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

DON was applied during M1 differentiation or to fully polarized M1 macrophages, revealing that glutamine inhibition initially suppressed M1 activity but later enhanced it, resulting in sustained pro-inflammatory activation. Multi omics analyses (bulk RNA seq and LC MS), time course assays, and glutamine depletion experiments consistently suggested that prolonged glutamine inhibition elevates glutamine levels, which sustain pro-inflammatory gene transcription. In contrast, M2 and tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), which are immunosuppressive, were more susceptible to DON, leading to functional suppression. Collectively, our findings uncover stage specific mechanisms by which glutamine inhibition modulates M1 polarization, offering a mechanistic rationale for therapeutic strategies that sustain pro-inflammatory, anti tumor macrophage activity while concurrently suppressing immunosuppressive myeloid subsets in cancer.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

A.; Westendorp, B.", "abstract": "The E2F-RB pathway is essential to enforce the G1/S checkpoint. Hence, many tumors contain mutations that override this checkpoint, such as RB1 loss or CDKN2A loss, to activate E2F dependent transcription, which facilitates cell cycle entry. However, these mutations do not necessarily result in sustained E2F-dependent transcription throughout the cell cycle. This is different in tumors with E2F3 amplification, because the resulting E2F3 overexpression persists through S- and G2-phase to cause excessive and unscheduled E2F-dependent transcription. E2F3 is a bona fide oncogene, which is frequently amplified in bladder cancer. Here we investigated how E2F3 amplification impacts the cancer cell cycle. Using isogenic bladder cancer cell lines and patient data we found that E2F3 amplification causes hyperactivation of the FOXM1-dependent mitotic gene expression program, including cyclin B1. This primes cells to undergo unscheduled and catastrophic mitosis when the mitotic kinase CDK1 was hyperactivated by treating cells with the PKMYT1 inhibitor RP-6306, thus uncovering a promising synthetic lethal interaction. Bladder cancer cells with E2F3 amplification developed resistance to RP-6306 by reducing cyclin B1 expression, thereby mitigating premature mitotic entry. This resistance could be overcome by adding a low dose of WEE1 inhibitor to PKMYT1 inhibition. Together, these data strongly suggest that PKMYT1-dependent inactivation of CDK1 is essential to prevent premature mitosis in bladder cancer cells harboring E2F3 amplifications. This suggests an opportunity for precision medicine strategies in bladder cancer patients with E2F3 amplification and/or excessive cyclin B1 expression.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Here, we used CD19-Cre-mediated conditional deletion initiated at the pro B cells stage to investigate the function of Arid1a/1b in vivo in mice. Loss of either gene partially blocked B cell differentiation in the bone marrow, reducing immature/recirculating B cell output, and impaired germinal center formation following antigen challenge. Combined deletion resulted in a more severe phenotype, with marked reduction in peripheral B cells, shortened survival, and development of an aggressive leukemia. Unexpectedly, the malignancy was of myeloid origin and arose from a small subset of CD19-expressing multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Arid1a/Arid1b-deficient MPPs exhibited abnormal expansion, reduced colony formation in methylcellulose, and transcriptional dysregulation of stemness and lineage-priming programs, including diminished CBFA2T3 (ETO2) and Fli1 signatures. In established B cell lymphoma cells in vitro, double ARID1A/ARID1B loss only modestly affected cell growth, whereas loss of ARID1A increased sensitivity to pharmacological EZH2 inhibition.

M.", "abstract": "Abstract Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) circulate widely in domestic and wild birds and continue to pose major risks to animal and public health, in particular those of high pathogenicity (HP). Ducks play a key role in AIV ecology due to frequent subclinical infections and high viral shedding. Efficient environmental surveillance approaches are needed to complement costly individual testing, especially in the context of large-scale anti-H5 vaccination as implemented in France. We evaluated duck slurry, the wastewater produced in duck fattening units, as a matrix for AIV detection and optimized molecular protocols for sensitive molecular detection and genetic characterization. Slurry samples (n = 173) were collected from 37 duck farms in southwestern France between May 2024 and March 2025. Among several extraction strategies, RNA extraction from the solid fraction using TRIzol LS followed by magnetic bead purification yielded the highest sensitivity. Using this optimized protocol, 82% of samples tested positive for AIV RNA, with 30% of positives being H5-positive; no H7 viruses were detected. Whole-segment RT-PCR and sequencing were successful for shorter genomic segments, enabling subtype determination, although virus isolation consistently failed. These findings demonstrate that slurry is a promising matrix for AIV detection, providing valuable molecular data. Slurry-based surveillance may therefore serve as an effective complement to individual testing and improve early warning capacities for influenza surveillance in a One Health perspective. Importance In France, current surveillance of high pathogenicity avian influenza in ducks relies mainly on individual swabs, which may miss subclinical or transient infections, particularly with low-pathogenicity strains. By targeting slurry, a wastewater generated in duck fattening units, we developed an affordable and practical approach for environmental surveillance. Slurry samples captured high levels of avian influenza RNA and allowed partial genomic characterization despite failed virus isolation. This strategy is directly relevant to monitoring avian influenza viruses dynamics under current anti-H5 vaccination and can be extended to other livestock systems. Duck slurry-based surveillance thus represents an efficient One Health tool to strengthen preparedness against avian influenza outbreaks.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Biofilm-mimetic hydrogels and natural biofilms revealed that altering Pels charge via pH adjustment or chemical acetylation, or tuning the Pel:eDNA ratio, predictably modulates PYO retention and EET efficiency.

Critical for pedestal formation is EPECs type III secretion system, which injects ~ 20 effector proteins into human cells. One of these effectors is Tir, which inserts into the host plasma membrane and stimulates the assembly of actin filaments essential for pedestal generation. To date, actin polymerization is the only host process known to contribute to pedestal formation. Here we report that EPEC co-opts the membrane trafficking pathway of polarized exocytosis, which acts together with actin polymerization to allow the efficient production of pedestals. Polarized exocytosis is mediated by the exocyst -- a human octameric complex that uses intracellular vesicles to expand the plasma membrane. We found that EPEC stimulated exocytosis at sites of pedestal formation in a manner dependent on the exocyst. The bacterial effector EspH recruited the exocyst and promoted exocytosis. Genetic inactivation of espH or RNA interference (RNAi)-induced depletion of exocyst components reduced both the frequency and size of pedestals and impaired EPEC colonization of host cells. Additional RNAi experiments indicated that the exocyst is dispensable for actin filament assembly in pedestals. Co-depletion of components of the exocyst and the Arp2/3 complex showed that exocytosis and actin polymerization make additive contributions to pedestal formation.

However, it remains unclear how the nutrients released during cell lysis affect the growth dynamics of the remaining bacterial population. Addressing this gap, we built a controlled system consisting of two Escherichia coli lysogenic strains: one carrying a wild-type {lambda} prophage and the other a temperature-inducible variant that can be induced to lyse at 38 {degrees}C. Using this system, we selectively induced phage lysis in a defined fraction of the population and quantified both total biomass and the biomass of surviving, non-lysed cells. We observed that the biomass loss was consistently smaller than expected based on the fraction of lysed cells, supporting the idea that some of the released biomass is rapidly recycled by the non-lysed population. To formalize the observed dynamics and obtain quantitative insight, we developed a mathematical model showing that nutrients released during lysis can transiently enhance the growth rate of the surviving, non-lysed cells. This effect emerges on a short timescale of minutes, consistent with the rapid onset of biomass compensation observed experimentally. The growth rate increase was confirmed in single-cell experiments using microfluidics and time-lapse microscopy, where we cultured wild-type lysogens in lysate-containing culture supernatants. In summary, the results suggest that nutrients released through lysis are rapidly consumed, leading to an acceleration in the growth rate of non-lysed cells. The consequent partial compensation for cell loss can substantially influence the population dynamics, highlighting phage lysis as a direct modulator of bacterial growth. Overall, our findings provide quantitative insights into how phage-mediated lysis affects the physiology of non-lysed bacterial cells, extending beyond its well-established role in biomass recycling.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

When integrated into predictive frameworks and spatial decision-support tools, this knowledge becomes especially valuable for strategic planning, particularly in complex multi-habitat restoration projects where spatial configuration remains a crucial yet understudied dimension influencing ecosystem recovery trajectories. We collect and analyze animal data from one of the world's largest multi-habitat coastal restoration systems in Denmark, comprising restored seagrass (Zostera marina), boulder reefs and mussel reefs. Using fine-scale spatial patterns in population abundances, we develop spatially explicit predictions across the seascape for various seagrass restoration scenarios and produce a series of optimizations, showing that it is practical to configure restoration to optimize biodiversity objectives, including those linked with fished species. Species-specific responses translated to variable outcomes across restoration scenarios and optimizations. While the optimal number and arrangement of restored patches varied depending on the target species or species group (e.g., fisheries species or seagrass specialists), one near-ubiquitous arrangement was patchy seagrass planting. This aligns with current practice, maximizes restoration efficiency, and highlights the importance of not homogenizing seascapes for biodiversity.

However, recent work demonstrates substantial variation in microbial communities across hosts and over time, and the causes of this instability are not always clear. We describe large temporal, among-individual and across-population variation in the microbiome of the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, a widespread pest of stored grain flour and a laboratory model organism. Across a 5-year period, the total load and composition of the bacterial community of laboratory beetle populations fluctuated dramatically, cycling between a few dominant taxa and hundreds of rare taxa. Our experiments show that this ecological drift is caused by a lack of maternal microbial transmission and large microbial load fluctuations in the primary reservoir of microbial inocula: the flour. Flour microbial load is important because newly hatched larvae (from eggs) and newly eclosed adults (from pupae) acquire microbes from ingested flour containing the fecal material of other individuals. The flour microbiome fluctuates depending on host population density and stage structure, with larval feces increasing microbial load, and antimicrobial secretions from mature adults decreasing it. Finally, periodic flour replacement during population maintenance also dramatically decreases flour bacterial load, contributing to stochasticity in microbial colonization. Our work thus represents a case study of significant and pervasive ecological drift even in a highly controlled laboratory environment. We suggest that such unstable microbial communities may not be uncommon, and can serve as good models to understand early stages of the evolution and ecology of host-microbial interactions.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

As such, spermless daf-18 null mutants undergo full-scale oogenesis and ovulation in a futile manner, wasting all produced oocytes. When oocyte laying is prevented in these mutants, oocytes hyperaccumulate to form differentiated benign tumors. Here, we show that daf-18 expression in the spermatheca neck myoepithelium is sufficient to induce oocyte arrest and homeostatic downregulation of germline stem cell proliferation in spermless hermaphrodites, altogether prohibiting tumorigenesis. We demonstrate that DAF-18 promotes spermatheca neck contractility through limiting PIP3 levels and AKT activity, preventing the latter from inactivating RHO-1/RhoA by direct phosphorylation at a conserved site.

Several external factors are known to influence and direct active cell movement, such as chemokine gradients or the composition and mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM). While progress has been made in elucidating some of the biochemical pathways that control cell migration, little is known about the impact of the porous structure of the ECM on active cell motion. Here, by combining computational modelling and theory, we reveal how porous environments, as represented by the ECM, determine cell migration dynamics. Simulating cell movement in a 3D cellular Potts model accounting for amoeboid-like cell shape dynamics, we show that cell migration within disordered porous environments is characterized by distinct transient motility regimes that deviate from persistent motion and are best described by 'hopping' of cells between 'traps'. Using theory, we are able to show how these motility regimes and large scale transport properties are linked to geometrical properties of the microstructure. Importantly, our analyses reveal that spatial heterogeneities in the porosity lead to non-homogeneous cell distributions and effectively guide cell movement towards regions of low porosity, an effect which we here term as porotaxis. Overall, our work reveals the porosity of the ECM as an important control parameter that shapes cell migration and cellular distribution, and provides a conceptual framework to relate experimentally observed cell motility modes to tissue structures and vice versa. This connection between geometry and cell motility could enhance our understanding of how structural elements shape cell migration and tissue organization in various conditions, such as chronic inflammation, immunity, and cancer.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

This apparent complexity of function is a significant hurdle in their future application and rational design. Here, we combine single-molecule tracking with optical single-channel recording in synthetic mimics of bacterial membranes to image the pores formed by AMPs in real time, mapping the diffusion of individual AMPs relative to sites of membrane permeablization. Using alamethicin, magainin-II and melittin as archetypes of three principal membrane-disrupting AMP classes, we observe AMP molecules freely diffusing on the membrane, but with an enhancement of local peptide surface density within a nanoscopic region surrounding each pore locus. We do not observe this enhancement for indolicidin, an AMP which is not believed to use pore formation as its main mode of toxicity. Corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations that replicate our experiments, these results suggest defects formed by membrane-active AMPs are persistent but dynamic structures, stabilised by individual peptides free to diffuse into and out of the pore. Whilst alamethicin, magainin-II and melittin are often placed in different mechanistic pore-forming groups, the broad similarities between observations in these different AMPs encourages a continuum view of pore-forming ability, rather than discrete categories of mechanism.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Here we present an integrated pipeline combining MALDI-MS Imaging (MSI) and in situ cryo-ET for single-cell identification and classification. Our approach enables MSI data acquisition directly from EM grids that were previously analyzed using cryo-ET, and allows unambiguous identification and classification of cell species and type. The method can be used on any eukaryotic single-cell cryo-ET sample without prior modification and takes less than 36 h for the entire workflow per grid, with significant potential for parallelization.

Since KB metabolism intersects with multiple metabolic pathways, and skeletal muscle KB catabolism rises during exercise, we tested the hypothesis that liver-specific HMGCS2 knockouts (KO) would have reduced energy expenditure (EE) and changes in the mitochondrial proteome of skeletal muscle with chronic exercise through voluntary wheel running (VWR), time-restricted feeding (TRF), or both combined to boost hepatic KB production and utilization. Control (CON) and HMGCS2 knockout (KO) mice (n=6-8 per group) underwent sedentary ad libitum feeding (SED+AL), SED+TRF, VWR+AL, and VWR+TRF for 16 weeks, with whole-body EE measured using indirect calorimetry. In CON mice, VWR increased total EE by 19.5% and non-resting EE by 50% under AL conditions, and total EE by 16% and non-resting EE by 47.9% under TRF conditions. However, the EE increases seen with VWR did not occur in KO mice. Proteomic analysis revealed that the loss of liver HMGCS2 significantly impacted proteins involved in metabolic processes within skeletal muscle, including reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) protein expression in SED KO mice compared to sedentary CON. Notably, VWR restored OXPHOS protein expression in the muscle of the liver HMGCS2 KO but did not alter it in the CON. Furthermore, muscle from liver HMGCS2 KO mice had elevated expression glycolytic pathways in sedentary and VWR conditions.

These sensors share the key mechanism of editing a stop codon opposite a specific sequence motif in the target transcript, where this motif requirement is dictated by ADAR's strong sequence preference. This constrains sensor design and precludes the sensing of short sequences that lack such motifs, often essential for key applications such as sensing viral RNAs and differentiating splice isoforms. Here we address this limitation with modular RNA sensors using adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (\"modulADAR\"). ModulADAR features two key elements that mirror the modularity of ADARs: regions that hybridize with the target transcript to recruit ADAR's dsRNA-binding domains, and a stem-loop for stop-codon editing by ADAR's catalytic domain. We optimize modulADAR and apply it to detect short subsequences that cannot be sensed by prior-generation sensors. We anticipate that modulADAR will empower broader basic science and therapeutic applications, especially those that will uniquely benefit from programmable RNA detection in living cells.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

In particular, it is expressed by activated T cells, where it has been shown to play an inhibitory role, dampening their response to tumor cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have had considerable success in treating cancers such as B cell leukemias, but face several obstacles in the treatment of solid tumors. We hypothesized that NRP-1 may contribute to dampening CAR T cell responses to cancer. While NRP-1 blockade either through neutralizing antibodies or through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion did not improve CAR T cell cytotoxic activity in an in vitro solid tumor model, NRP-1 was found to have a protective effect against CAR T cells when expressed by the tumor cells, in line with previous literature implicating NRP-1 as a pro-tumor factor involved in their growth and invasiveness. We found that NRP-1 was transferred from target cells to CAR T cells via trogocytosis, i.e. the \"nibbling\" and subsequent display of membrane proteins from one cell by another. CD19, the target antigen in this model, was also transferred to CAR T cells, raising interesting questions about trogocytosis as a marker for effective tumor cell killing through direct interaction. On the contrary, trogocytosis may impede effective CAR T function by promoting fratricide due to their display of target antigen. While no conclusive mechanisms for NRP-1 activity were found, several avenues of research have been opened up to further our understanding of the multifaceted roles of NRP-1 in CAR T cell activity and interactions with their targets.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

We identified distinct immunological landscapes across these compartments. Compared to blood, tumor-invaded LNs and tumors were enriched for follicular regulatory T cells (Treg-Tfr), conventional T cell subsets with Tfh-like characteristics (Tconv-Tfh and Tconv-CXCL13), and tissue-resident memory Tregs (Treg-Trm). These populations share a BATF-dependent transcriptional program that governs T-cell activation and tissue adaptation, while simultaneously engaging distinct, subset-specific regulatory networks. Integrative TCR-RNA analysis revealed that tumor-reactive, neoantigen-specific T cell clones were enriched within these subsets and demonstrated extensive LN-tumor clonal sharing, indicating active recirculation between compartments. Through clonal coupling analysis and trajectory inference, we uncovered that Treg-Tfr cells function as multipotent progenitors that bifurcate into tissue-resident Treg-Trm or into ex-Tregs adopting a Tfh-like CXCL13+ effector phenotype. Remarkably, follicular CD4+ T subsets from LNs and tumor were transcriptionally and epigenetically similar and localized to analogous germinal center niches. These findings establish tumor-invaded LNs as functional extensions of the tumor microenvironment that generate and maintain tumor-reactive CD4+ lineages.

We explored the impact of murine unilateral hind-limb ischaemia (HLI) surgery on the structure and function of the ischaemic and non-ischaemic BM, versus control mice without HLI surgery. Abnormal BM hypoxia was present in the ischaemic limb 7-days post-HLI, with normalisation by 28-days. Histological analysis revealed the ischaemic BM to undergo profound vascular remodelling at 7-days that normalised by 61-days, along with a progressive accumulation of BM lipid droplets between 7- and 61-days; no structural changes were observed in the non-ischaemic limb BM. Flow cytometry revealed increased abundance of monocytes and inflammatory monocytes in the non-ischaemic and ischaemic BM 7-days post-HLI, with this persisting at 61-days in the non-ischaemic limb. In both limbs, we observed a progressive decline in the abundance of lineage-Sca-1+c-Kit+ haematopoietic stem cells. RNA-sequencing of BM-derived macrophages (BMDMs) revealed substantial transcriptomic differences between unstimulated control, ischaemic limb and non-ischaemic limb BMDMs. Moreover, there were also substantial transcriptomic differences between lipopolysaccharide-stimulated control and ischaemic limb BMDMs. However, we observed minimal differences in chromatin accessibility of unstimulated BMDMs from the 3 groups. Collectively, our data show that BM ischaemia has transient and sustained structural implications, along with both local and systemic effects on haematopoiesis and myeloid cell function.

To obtain an improved BCG-based vaccine candidate with increased immune signaling but still low virulence, we have previously generated a recombinant BCG strain named BCG::ESX-1Mmar, which is heterologously expressing ESX-1 functions of Mycobacterium marinum and thereby modulates the host innate immune responses via phagosomal rupture-associated induction of type I interferon production and enhanced inflammasome activity, leading to superior protection against TB disease in murine infection models. As protection may also vary with the route of vaccination, here, we have explored aerosol vaccination relative to subcutaneous vaccination, using BCG Pasteur and BCG::ESX-1Mmar. We found that mice vaccinated via the aerosol route with BCG Pasteur or BCG::ESX-1Mmar both yielded higher frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T effector memory (TEM) cells in the lungs compared to subcutaneously immunised mice, whereas comparable poly-functional Th1 (IL-2, TNF-a; and IFN-g) cytokine-producing subsets were observed in the spleens of all vaccinated mice. Significantly higher IL-17 responses without severe lung pathology were seen in the lungs of aerosol-vaccinated mice associated to local and transient inflammatory cytokine responses and immune cell infiltrations. Aerosol vaccination also elicited high amounts of humoral IgG and IgM responses in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and induced substantial lung CD69+ CD103+ T resident memory (TRM) cells, containing both CD4+ and CD8+ T subsets, in the airways of immunised mice, whereas this was not the case for subcutaneous vaccination. These effects led to significant improved protection against M. tuberculosis and reduced lung pathology in aerosol-vaccinated mice compared to subcutaneously vaccinated mice. Moreover, BCG::ESX-1Mmar induced enhanced T-cell immunity and superior protection compared to parental BCG Pasteur for both vaccination routes and thereby represents an interesting candidate for developing improved vaccination strategies against TB.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Its ability to colonize abiotic surfaces of clinical devices - such as catheters and airway management systems - can result in life-threatening sepsis, especially in immunocompromised patients. A deeper understanding of C. albicans biofilm development under different environmental conditions is essential for improving antifungal treatments. In this study, we examine C. albicans biofilm formation using live fluorescence microscopy across multiple scales and modalities, and introduce new quantification approaches. High-magnification tracking of hyphal tips reveals that hyphal elongation occurs intermittently rather than continuously. Using a new automated tracking approach, we show that hyphal emergence is initially rapid and slows down after approximately two hours. At lower magnifications, area coverage across large fields of view proves to be a robust and scalable metric. It is strongly influenced by seed density and extends analysis to later stages of growth. Elevated carbon dioxide levels significantly accelerate area coverage, promoting rapid biofilm expansion. Blue light illumination reduces C. albicans growth in a dose-dependent manner. Light-sheet imaging enables the long-term capture of vertical biofilm growth, complementing widefield-based approaches.

We have shown that during infection of primary macrophages, hypoxia-induced citrate limitation results in inhibition of C. burnetii replication without affecting viability. Here, primary murine macrophages were infected with C. burnetii under normoxic (21% O2) and hypoxic (0.5% O2) conditions to clarify how C. burnetii survives this environmental stress condition. Our data suggests that under hypoxic conditions C. burnetii does not undergo stringent response, but instead enters a SCV-like form, which is smaller in size and possesses dense chromatin material and a thicker cell wall. These changes have functional consequences, as the SCV-like persistent form of C. burnetii is more infectious, more tolerant to antibiotics and less sensitive to clearance by IFN{gamma} activated macrophages.

These resistant pathogens and their antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) can spread to humans through environmental exposure and the food chain, posing serious public health risks. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), alongside phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), enables a comprehensive understanding of resistance mechanisms and informs antimicrobial stewardship strategies, particularly in resource-limited settings. Aim: This study aimed to characterize the phenotypic and genotypic antimicrobial resistance profiles, plasmid content, and virulence factors of an MDR E. coli strain (S3) isolated from a poultry farm in Enugu State, Nigeria, to elucidate potential risks to public health and the role of poultry as a reservoir for resistance determinants. Methods: E. coli strain S3 was isolated from chicken droppings using standard microbiological methods and confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. AST was assessed using disc diffusion and broth microdilution to determine minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for ten antibiotics across multiple classes. WGS was performed with a hybrid approach combining Illumina and Nanopore platforms, followed by genome assembly and annotation. ARGs, plasmid replicons, and virulence factors were identified in silico using AMRFinderPlus, starAMR, RGI/CARD, PlasmidFinder, MOB-suite, and the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB). Results: Phenotypic testing revealed extensive resistance, with complete resistance to six of seven tested antibiotics (cefotaxime, ampicillin, erythromycin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, and doxycycline). MICs exceeded clinical breakpoints for multiple classes, confirming an MDR phenotype. Genome analysis indicated a 5.33 Mb genome distributed across five contigs, including one chromosome and four plasmid-associated contigs. The strain harboured numerous ARGs, including blaCTX-M-15, blaOXA-1, blaTEM-1, aac(6)-Ib-cr, aadA5, aph(3)-Ib, sul1/sul2, tet(A), dfrA17, and mph(A), co-localized on plasmids indicative of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) potential. Plasmid types included Col156, IncF, and two rep clusters. Virulence profiling revealed genes associated with adhesion (pap cluster, ECP), iron acquisition (enterobactin, yersiniabactin, aerobactin, heme uptake), and toxins (sat, senB), highlighting the isolates potential for urinary tract and intestinal infections. Conclusion: This study highlights the significant role of poultry-associated bacteria as reservoirs of AMR genes, particularly those harboured on mobile plasmids with potential for HGT. E. coli strain S3 exhibits extensive multidrug resistance and carries a complex plasmid repertoire facilitating horizontal transfer of ARGs. Coupled with a rich virulence gene profile, this strain underscores the public health risk posed by poultry-associated E. coli in Nigeria. These findings demonstrate the urgent need for stringent antimicrobial stewardship, regulatory oversight, and genomic surveillance in poultry production milieus to mitigate the dissemination of MDR pathogens.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

High severity desert fires are uncommon but typically chart a new successional trajectory altering plant communities for at least 65 years. These aboveground vegetation shifts can have large implications for belowground microbial communities that maintain soil structure and nutrient cycling. High severity wildfires in forests or shrublands can severely reduce microbial species richness and biomass and alter microbiomes for decades but impacts on desert soil microbiomes are virtually unknown. 2. The 2020 Mojave Desert Dome Fire burned 43,273 acres of Eastern Joshua tree (Yucca jaegeriana) habitat, burning roughly 1 million trees. To track aboveground and belowground impacts of the Dome Fire, we established 9 plots (6 burned; 3 unburned) and sampled 4 subsamples per plot for 5 time points ranging from 2 weeks to 3 years post-fire. We measured initial ash depth as a proxy of soil burn severity and assessed plant mortality, plant richness, soil chemical characteristics, estimated soil microbial biomass with qPCR, and microbial richness and composition with Illumina MiSeq of 16S and ITS2 amplicons. 3. Belowground communities were highly diverse, containing 25,444 bacterial, 269 archaeal, and 6,683 fungal ASVs amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) or microbial taxa. We identified at least 65 plant species and saw 80% Eastern Joshua tree mortality in burned plots over three years, with reduced plant richness post-fire except an abundance of annual herbs at 1-year post-fire, yet the fire did not significantly reduce microbial biomass or richness at any time point. 4. Microbial communities for both bacteria and fungi showed small but significant changes, enriching for pyrophilous microbes in burned plots. We identified increases of pyrophilous microbes such as Tumebacillus, Massilia, Noviherbaspirillum bacteria and Pseudotricharina, Penicillium, Coniochaeta and Naganishia fungi. 5.

During vRNP replication, NP proteins must rapidly switch between monomeric and polymeric states to sustain dynamic equilibrium, which relies on NP phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycling and is crucial for viral nucleic acid replication. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling this process remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed an RdRp/vRNP-targeted affinity mass spectrometry-based differential analysis method, discovered that the cellular protein phosphatase Mg2+/Mn2+-dependent 1G (PPM1G) is a phosphatase of NP and required for maintaining viral polymerase activity. Overexpression of PPM1G decreased viral replication. In ppm1g flox/flox-Sftpc Cre mice, lethal influenza infection led to survival and mild disease, as well as reduced lung viral loads and inflammation. These results suggest that PPM1G is a key host molecule for maintaining steady state of viral replication. PPM1G expression is up-regulated upon influenza virus infection. This heightened expression occurs in response to in-creased viral protein production, simultaneously leading to elevated dephosphorylation of NP, which accelerates NP polymerization to promote viral replication. Meanwhile, surplus NP can be degraded through the ATG7 autophagy-lysosome pathway.

Insightfully, KhpA and KhpB facilitate the interactions of the representative sRNAs PprS and Dsr9 in D. radiodurans with their respective mRNA targets, pprM and DR_1968. Through RNA-seq analysis, we further revealed that KhpA and KhpB have both overlapping and specific roles in a global gene regulation in D. radiodurans. Overall, this study expands our knowledge of posttranscriptional regulation in D. radiodurans and supports the growing consensus that KhpA and KhpB homologs constitute a new family of sRNA binding proteins in Gram-positive bacteria.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Immature embryonic vessels are structurally supported by extracellular matrix (ECM), which is also critical for normal liver development and function. During this same period, pro-inflammatory cytokines that function to promote hematopoiesis and hepatic organogenesis must be tightly regulated to prevent sterile inflammation. However, the contributions of endothelial cells to ECM and cytokine production during embryonic liver development are still poorly understood. Here we explore how the epigenetic chromatin-remodeling enzymes CHD4 and BRG1 work antagonistically in embryonic endothelial cells to protect developing livers from lethal degeneration. Our transcriptomic analysis of endothelial Chd4 mutant livers, which undergo degeneration after midgestation, indicated an upregulation of both the ECM protease plasmin activity and sterile inflammation prior to the onset of lethal hepatic phenotypes. Within these pathways, we found that endothelial CHD4 and BRG1 antagonistically regulated transcription of the plasmin activator uPAR and of the inflammatory adhesion molecule ICAM-1 in developing livers. Importantly, elevated plasmin activity and sterile inflammation synergistically contribute to hepatic degeneration because a combination of genetic plasminogen reduction and treatment with the anti-inflammatory drug carprofen reduced Chd4 mutant liver phenotypes more effectively than plasminogen deficiency or carprofen alone. Our findings highlight the critical role of endothelial cells in transcriptionally modulating plasmin activity and sterile inflammation and demonstrate the detrimental synergy of these pathways during liver development.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

R.; Castillo, E. F.", "abstract": "Background & Aims: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) represent progressive stages of liver disease, with distinct metabolic and cellular alterations. This study investigates the progression from MASLD to MASH through metabolomics, lipidomics, and assessment of hormones. Methods: Male C57BL/6NTac mice were fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks to induce MASLD and for 29 weeks to develop MASH. Aged-matched controls on a normal diet were used for comparison. Histology confirmed the progression of MASLD to MASH. We performed metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of liver, colon, and stool samples to identify metabolic and lipid alterations. Plasma enteroendocrine hormones and cytokines were quantified. Immunofluorescence was performed to assess enteroendocrine cells changes in the colon and the association of serotonin (5-HT) with fibronectin in the liver. Results: Metabolomic and lipidomic analysis revealed significant alterations at different stages of the disease. Specifically, cholic acid was increased across the liver, colon, and stool in both MASLD and MASH mice compared to controls. Compared to the control group, MASLD mice exhibited an increase in enteroendocrine hormones, GLP-1, GIP, and PYY, whereas no changes were observed in MASH mice. Comparing MASLD to MASH livers, we found hepatic 5-HT levels were increased in MASH mice compared to MASLD mice. The MASH liver also exhibited a colocalization between fibronectin and 5-HT, suggesting a potential role of 5-HT in liver fibrosis. Conclusions: Our study provides novel insights into the progressive metabolic and hormonal changes from MASLD to MASH. The increase in cholic acid and differential enteroendocrine hormone responses highlight the complex interactions between the gut and liver in metabolic liver diseases. These findings suggest that enteroendocrine hormones may play a role in the progression of MASLD to MASH as well as liver fibrosis, offering potential therapeutic avenues for targeting the gut-liver axis in metabolic liver diseases.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Genetic variation within species shapes phenotypes, but identifying the specific genes and variants that cause phenotypic differences is costly and challenging. Here, we introduce CRI-SPA-Map, a genetic mapping strategy combining CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering, selective ploidy ablation (SPA), and high-throughput phenotyping for precise genetic mapping with or without genotyping in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In CRI-SPA-Map, a donor strain carrying SPA machinery is mated to a genetically different recipient strain harboring a genome-integrated selectable cassette. In the resulting diploid, CRISPR-Cas9 cuts the cassette for replacement with DNA from the homologous donor chromosome. Donor chromosomes are then removed using SPA to yield haploid recombinant strains. To establish CRI-SPA-Map, we mated a W303 SPA strain to 92 strains from the BY4742 yeast knockout collection that carry gene deletion cassettes on the left arm of chromosome XIV and created 1,451 recombinant isolates. Whole-genome sequencing verified that deletion cassette replacement introduced short donor DNA tracts of variable length, resulting in a finely recombined mapping population. Using only the known location of the gene deletions, which marks where donor DNA is introduced, we identified a 6.5 kb-region shaping yeast growth. Further dissection of this region pinpointed two causal variants in two genes, MKT1 and SAL1. Engineering these variants alone and in combination revealed gene-by-environment interactions at both genes, as well as epistatic interactions between them that were in turn dependent on the environment. CRI-SPA-Map is a cost-effective strategy for creating high-resolution recombinant panels of yeast strains for identifying the genetic basis of phenotypic variation.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

Purification of an nsP4 derivative capable of processive RNA synthesis from a heteropolymeric template has been unsuccessful. Prior studies indicated Onyong-nyong virus (ONNV) nsP4 is soluble and requires additional non-structural proteins for activity. We performed biochemical and biophysical characterization of ONNV nsP4, including analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), revealing an extended conformation inconsistent with AlphaFold predictions of a compact structure. Fold switching was required for the extended conformation. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry confirmed the fold-switched, extended state. Phylogenetic analysis showed conservation of residues contributing to both extended and compact states, implying functional roles for each. The extended form exhibited weak RNA binding and no polymerase activity on primed templates. The SAXS envelope of a precursor containing 50 amino acids from the nsP3 C-terminus (CT50-P34) matched the compact state. We propose precursor forms adopt the compact conformation. At the replication site, proteolytic cleavage would convert the precursor to an active polymerase.

To address this critical gap in knowledge, we first performed scRNAseq on gated cell populations to validate CXCR6+ CD127- as new phenotypic markers to enrich for bona-fide Tr1 cells. Importantly, these Tr1 cells potently suppressed the proliferation of other CD4+ T cells in vitro via IL-10 secretion. Among children living in malaria-endemic Uganda, CXCR6+ CD127- Tr1 cells were the dominant responding subset to Pf-infected red blood cell stimulation in vitro. They also rapidly expanded following malaria and expressed IL-10 and IFNg during infection in vivo. Tr1 abundance correlated with plasma concentrations of granzyme A, IFNg, IL-10, and LAG3, suggesting that these cells act systemically. Higher CXCR6+ CD127- Tr1 cell frequency correlated with a lower probability of symptoms given parasitemia but were also associated with delayed parasite clearance among untreated, asymptomatic children.

To dissect the influence of a plant on its microbiome, repeated cycling of microbiomes can be utilized to enhance functional properties in the enriched microbial communities. We used such a successive cultivation approach for wheat (Triticum aestivum) microbiome under drought conditions and selected lineages for drought resilience and susceptibility, with and without enriching the starting community with a wheat isolate library. Significant differences in the rhizosphere microbiome between selection regimes were confirmed through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Notably, replicate lineages of each selection regime showed convergence to similar microbiomes. Specific genera were abundant depending on the selection regimes; Stenotrophomonas under drought resilience, while Rahnella under drought conditions when the strain library was added initially. Applying Stenotrophomonas or Rahnella as single inoculum did not improve drought resilience in wheat.

Deep learning-based automation has emerged as a promising solution, existing global general-purpose models exhibit limitations in precisely recognizing local endemic species and adapting to unique local ecosystems. This study developed a high-performance classification model optimized for native species. A large-scale '''Korean Wildlife Dataset'' 'was constructed from data collected across diverse domestic habitats, and a novel architecture was proposed to overcome limitations of conventional CNNs. The proposed Graph Attention Contrastive Learning (GACL) model is structured as a two-stage pipeline. Stage one employs YOLOv5 and MegaDetector to detect animals, humans, and vehicles, filtering valid images. Stage two performs fine-grained species classification. GACL captures structural relationships among object parts using a Graph Attention Transformer (GAT) and aligns semantic correspondence between images and textual descriptions via Parallel Contrastive Learning, enabling deeper understanding beyond simple visual features. Evaluation on an independent test set demonstrated that the proposed model robust classification performance with an overall accuracy of 96.83% across four classes (Wildboar, Goral, Deers, and Other). Notably, in a comparative analysis against a global general-purpose model, our model showed distinct advantages in the precise recognition of endemic species. Furthermore, it exhibited a lower false positive rate in identifying animals in empty images, confirming its potential to enhance the efficiency of the data cleaning process.

Here, using a rare collection of human commensal Escherichia coli sampled in France from 1980 to 2020, we inferred the evolutionary history of the High Pathogenicity Island (HPI), a key virulence factor of E. coli with an uncertain evolutionary origin. We showed that the HPI was horizontally transferred from Yersinia pestis to E. coli and other Enterobacterales approximatively 4,800 years ago, coinciding with a period of high prevalence of the plague in the Neolithic. The element subsequently spread in the whole species and in Klebsiella pneumoniae, with signs of positive epistasis with phylogroups B2 and F, and was positively selected in the last 100 years.

Severe IRI is a leading contributor to early allograft dysfunction (EAD), a post-transplant complication associated with reduced graft survival. Current postoperative biomarkers provide limited time for intervention, highlighting a need to identify preoperative biomarkers of IRI. Meanwhile, tRNA fragments (tRFs) have emerged as novel biomarkers in various diseases, but remain unexplored in the context of liver transplant. Results: We performed small RNA sequencing on donor liver biopsies to investigate IRI-associated transcript changes. In parallel, donor liver perfusates were analyzed as a non-invasive surrogate for tissue profiling. Across samples, microRNAs (miRNAs) and tRFs were the most abundant small RNAs. Perfusate expression strongly correlated with paired biopsies, supporting its value as a non-invasive source. Comparison of post-reperfusion versus pre-implantation biopsies revealed that IRI reprogrammed tRF expression. Stratification by clinical outcome showed that patients who developed EAD exhibited specific tRNA fragments signature in both biopsy and perfusate. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that a tRF-based model achieved an AUC of 0.7748, outperforming the donor risk index alone (AUC = 0.6804), representing a 9.4% increase in discriminative capacity.

While low-intensity repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (LI-rTMS) shows potential in brain protection, its effects on iron processing and antioxidant use are unclear. This study explored LI-rTMS's role in regulating iron homeostasis and antioxidant defense for potential therapeutic use in CIRI. METHODS: A rat model of CIRI was established using a filament insertion technique, followed by neurological and infarct volume assessments. In PC12 cells, oxidative damage was induced with H2O2 or ferric ammonium citrate (FAC), then treated with LI-rTMS or deferoxamine (DFP). Parameters measured included oxidative stress markers, iron metabolism markers, and mitochondrial integrity. Gene knockdown and overexpression experiments explored mechanisms involving LI-rTMS and ACSL4. RESULTS: LI-rTMS improved neurological deficits by boosting GPX4 activity and inhibiting the ACSL4-LPCAT3-LOX axis, reducing lipid peroxidation. It restored iron balance by lowering TFR and DMT1, decreasing ferritin and hepcidin, and increasing FPN for better iron efflux. LI-rTMS also prevented the Fenton reaction, reduced ROS production, and maintained mitochondrial structure and transmembrane potential. CONCLUSIONS: LI-rTMS offers neuroprotection by regulating iron homeostasis through dual pathways: boosting export (via FPN) and reducing uptake/storage (via TFR/DMT1/FE).

Frequency effects, defined as a bias toward more frequently rewarded but less valuable options, have traditionally been viewed as maladaptive decision-making deficits. In the present study, we used a within-subject design in which participants completed a four-option reinforcement learning task twice, once under a baseline condition and once with a reward frequency manipulation, to test whether better baseline learning predicts greater or lesser susceptibility to frequency-based biases. Participants were first trained on two fixed option pairs and then transferred their knowledge to novel pairings in a testing phase. Across conditions, higher training accuracy generally predicted higher test accuracy, with one critical exception: on trials where a more valuable option was pitted against a more frequently rewarded but less valuable alternative, participants with higher training accuracy exhibited a stronger bias toward the more frequent option. Moreover, baseline optimal choice rates in these specific trials were unrelated to--and even slightly negatively correlated with--optimal choice rates under the frequency condition. Computational modeling further showed that participants with better baseline learning performance were better fit by frequency-sensitive models in the frequency condition and they weighed frequency-based processing more heavily than value-based processing. Overall, these findings suggest that frequency effects, rather than signaling flawed learning, manifest more strongly in individuals with better baseline learning performance. This seemingly irrational bias may, under conditions of uncertainty, reflect a flexible, adaptive strategy that emerges among the best learners when value-based approaches are costly or unreliable.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

In this study, we aimed to develop a groove brain-music interface (G-BMI) that generates personalized playlists to maximize each individual's groove experience, using a neurofeedback system based on in-ear EEG. Twenty-four participants listened to three high-groove and three low-groove musical excerpts and rated their \"urge to move.\" Using these ratings and the recorded EEG, we trained two LASSO models to build the G-BMI.

F.", "abstract": "Impulsive choice- preferring small, immediate rewards over larger, delayed reward- is a hallmark of many psychiatric disorders. Methylphenidate, a dopamine and noradrenaline transporter inhibitor, reduces impulsivity, but the neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unclear. Identifying a neurophysiological signature of methylphenidate action could be used clinically to predict treatment response and guide drug development. To this end, we recorded local field potentials (LFP) from 32 electrodes spanning cortico-striatal circuits in rats performing a temporal discounting task, under saline or methylphenidate treatment conditions. Methylphenidate decreased beta frequency (15-30 Hz) power and connectivity for small, immediate rewards while simultaneously increasing beta power for large, delayed rewards. Reduced connectivity in cortico-striatal networks during small rewards predicted increased preference for delayed rewards. These findings suggest that methylphenidate influences discounting behavior by modulating reward-evoked beta oscillations in cortico-striatal networks. Thus, beta oscillations may serve as a translational biomarker of treatment responsivity to monoaminergic drugs, providing a circuit-level assay to measure and predict changes in impulsive behavior.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

G.; Ra, Y.; Chen, Z.; Xu, S.; Burrell, M.; Matias, S.; Watabe-Uchida, M.; Uchida, N.", "abstract": "The neurotransmitter dopamine plays a major role in learning by acting as a teaching signal to update the brain's predictions about rewards. A leading theory proposes that this process is analogous to a reinforcement learning algorithm called temporal difference (TD) learning, and that dopamine acts as the error term within the TD algorithm (TD error). Although many studies have demonstrated similarities between dopamine activity and TD errors, the mechanistic basis for dopaminergic TD learning remains unknown. Here, we combined large-scale neural recordings with patterned optogenetic stimulation to examine whether and how the key steps in TD learning are accomplished by the circuitry connecting dopamine neurons and their targets. Replacing natural rewards with optogenetic stimulation of dopamine axons in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in a classical conditioning task gradually generated TD error-like activity patterns in dopamine neurons by specifically modifying the task-related activity of NAc neurons expressing the D1 dopamine receptor (D1 neurons). In turn, patterned optogenetic stimulation of NAc D1 neurons in naive animals drove dopamine neuron spiking according to the TD error of the stimulation pattern, indicating that TD computations are hardwired into this circuit. The transformation from D1 neurons to dopamine neurons could be described by a biphasic linear filter, with a rapid positive and delayed negative phase, that effectively computes a temporal difference. This finding suggests that the time horizon over which the TD algorithm operates--the temporal discount factor--is set by the balance of the positive and negative components of the linear filter, pointing to a circuit-level mechanism for temporal discounting. These results provide a new conceptual framework for understanding how the computations and parameters governing animal learning arise from neurobiological components.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Astrocytes are a type of glial cell in the central nervous system responsible for modulating synaptic transmissions, tissue repair, maintaining homeostasis, and are therefore implicated in many neurological diseases. Human cortical astrocytes are more structurally complex, larger, and have unique subtypes in comparison to the commonly studied rodent cortical astrocytes. As access to human cortical tissue is sparse, cerebral organoids (COs) derived from human pluripotent stem cells have emerged as a promising in vitro model for studying the human cortex. Astrocyte subtypes unique to humans are recapitulated in COs but have not been quantitatively assessed (1, 2). In this study, we characterized human astrocytes in situ in sliced COs cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI-COs). By 4 months of age, ALI-COs express many mature astrocyte markers and showed increasing levels of GFAP with longer culture durations. By employing immunostaining, tissue clearing, morphological reconstruction, and unsupervised clustering analysis, three major GFAP+ astrocyte subtypes were identified in ALI-COs. All subtypes exhibited greater morphological complexity than their mouse counterparts, as revealed by increased branching and longer branch extensions. However, consistent with the mid-gestation fetal stage of the ALI-COs, astrocytes did not fully recapitulate the complexity observed in adult human astrocytes, which are known to continue maturation postnatally.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}

This balance is especially critical during postnatal development, when biosynthetic and energetic demands are high, and nutrient supply and neonates have to adapt to periods of fasting. These conditions place acute stress on the proteostasis network, making autophagy essential for nutrient recycling. We found that the chaperone aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) supports both arms of this metabolic balance: promoting anabolic PI3K-AKT signaling for mTORC1 activation and enabling catabolic processes such as proteasomal degradation and autophagy. Loss of AIP causes a severe neonatal metabolic disorder, where affected infants fail to thrive postnatally. Our findings establish AIP as a central regulator of neonatal metabolic adaptation and cellular homeostasis.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Social tolerance mediates social learning in wild red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons) and ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)", "doi": "10.1101/2025.09.18.677073", "authors": "Sehner, S.; Ratsoavina, F.; Fichtel, C.", "abstract": "Social learning is widespread in the animal kingdom, allowing individuals to acquire information from conspecifics. Because such learning often follows the social network within a population, species with different social structures and tolerance levels may show distinct learning trajectories. We tested this in four groups of wild, egalitarian red-fronted lemurs (Eulemur rufifrons, N = 34) and three groups of wild, hierarchically organized ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta, N = 35) using a social diffusion experiment with feeding boxes. We also conducted a co-feeding test of social tolerance. The feeding boxes could be opened by either lifting or pushing the box. In experimental conditions, we trained a demonstrator in one of the two techniques; in control conditions, no demonstrator was trained. More red-fronted lemurs learned to open the box than ring-tailed lemurs, and they learned faster. Both species preferred the lifting technique, but when pushing was the seeded technique, most red-fronted lemurs adopted it, whereas ring-tailed lemurs did not. Order of acquisition diffusion analysis showed that in both species, social learning followed the social network and was more likely than individual learning. Social tolerance predicted the proportion of learners within a group, with red-fronted lemurs being more tolerant than ring-tailed lemurs. In a similar vein, in the more tolerant red-fronted lemurs, scrounging occurred much more often than in the less tolerant ring-tailed lemurs. Scrounging might also have driven the preference for lifting technique in red-fronted lemurs but not in ring-tailed lemurs. Our results show that tolerance facilitates social learning and that information spreads along social network pathways. Most importantly, our results show that these effects vary across species with different social structures. Together, this suggests that social tolerance can drive group-specific behaviours and may play a key role in the evolution of cultural traits.", "date": "2025-09-18", "journal": ""}
