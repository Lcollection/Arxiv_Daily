J.", "abstract": "The observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and their concentration into geographic sub-regions or 'blue zones', has generated considerable scientific interest. Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and 'supercentenarian' status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, England, and France, which have more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by poverty, low per capita incomes, shorter life expectancy, higher crime rates, worse health, higher deprivation, fewer 90+ year olds, and residence in remote, overseas, and colonial territories. In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age. Only 18% of 'exhaustively' validated supercentenarians have a birth certificate, falling to zero percent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error. Finally, the designated 'blue zones' of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Despite its central role, the communication between the Golgi and the cell nucleus has remained largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we have analysed and siRNA validated localisation data of the Human Protein Atlas, finding an unexpected and significant level of interconnectivity between the proteomes of the Golgi complex and nucleus, including an intriguing involvement in DNA repair processes. Here, we uncovered a cluster of DNA repair proteins present in distinct sub Golgi localisations as well as in the nuclear compartment. In response to genotoxic stress these proteins redistribute dynamically between the Golgi complex and the nucleus, with the specific type of DNA injury influencing this distribution pattern. To probe this Golgi nucleus link, we examined the Homologous Recombination (HR) regulator RAD51C and find that DNA damage triggers ATM dependent release of a Giantin tethered Golgi pool and Importin beta dependent nuclear import, where repair-associated nuclear foci form. Downregulation of Giantin prematurely releases RAD51C, producing RAD51C nuclear foci lacking key HR markers, reducing ATM activation, elevating genome instability, and accelerating cell proliferation. These findings support a timing-based pathway in which the Golgi acts as a spatiotemporal coordination node for HR regulators and other DDR factors. Our study sheds light on the dynamic interplay between the Golgi and the nucleus in safeguarding genomic stability while maintaining the delicate balance of cellular homeostasis.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

We used machine learning and mediation analysis to model interactions between neurobiological features (genetic variants in noradrenergic signalling, structural and functional fronto-parietal connectivity) and education (proxy of CR) on cognitive outcomes (general cognitive ability score) in the UK Biobank cohort.

We demonstrate that Endozoicomonas synthesizes the siderophore aerobactin in vitro-a trait potentially suppressed in hospite. Integrated metagenomics, metabolomics, and lab validations reveal that Endozoicomonas is the only microbe capable of metabolising coral-derived testosterone and converting ubiquitous cholesterol into testosterone and progesterone. These hormones accumulate within the coral holobiont during thermal stress, suggesting active microbial involvement in immune priming and stress mitigation. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized mechanism of microbial contribution to coral resilience.

The mechanisms controlling this feature remain to be fully understood. For over 30 years, it has been speculated that Hox genes play a key role in this process but evidence supporting this hypothesis has been largely indirect. In this study, we employed loss- and gain-of-function Hox gene variants in chick embryos to address this issue. Using this approach, we found that Hox4/5 genes are necessary but insufficient for forelimb formation. Within the Hox4/5 expression domain, Hox6/7 genes are sufficient for reprogramming of neck lateral plate mesoderm to form an ectopic limb bud, thereby inducing forelimb formation anterior to the normal limb field. Our findings demonstrate that the forelimb program depends on the combinatorial actions of these Hox genes. We propose that during the evolutionary emergence of the neck, Hox4/5 provides permissive cues for forelimb formation throughout the neck region, while the final position of the forelimb is determined by the instructive cues of Hox6/7 in the lateral plate mesoderm.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

However, its underlying brain mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Likewise, whether adolescents show a different NIF sensitivity to light compared to adults is not established. Here, we investigated whether cortical excitability, a basic aspect of brain function that depends on sleep wake regulation, is affected by blue light and whether the effect is similar in young adults and adolescents. To do so, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation coupled to high-density electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) in healthy young adults (N=13, 24.2 {+/-} 3.4 y) and in adolescents (N=15, 16.9 {+/-} 1.1 y). Our results showed that, in young adults, blue light affected cortical excitability following an apparent inverted-U relationship, while adolescents' cortical excitability was not significantly impacted by blue light. In addition, although light did not affect performance on a visuomotor vigilance task completed during the TMS-EEG recordings, cortical excitability was positively correlated to task performance in both age groups. This study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between light, cortical excitability, and behavior. Our findings highlight the role of age in NIF effects of light, suggesting that brain responses to light differ during developmental periods.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Thus, using variant effect datasets obtained with similar MAVE techniques can help reveal general rules governing the effects of amino acid variation for a single molecular phenotype. In this work, we accordingly combined data from six individual variant abundance by massively parallel sequencing (VAMP-seq) experiments and analysed a total of 31,614 variant effect scores reporting solely on the impact of single amino acid residue substitutions on the cellular abundance of proteins. Using our combined variant effect dataset, we derived and analysed a collection of amino acid substitution matrices describing the average impact on cellular abundance of all residue substitution types in different structural environments. We found that the substitution matrices predict the cellular abundance of protein variants with surprisingly high accuracy when given structural information only in the form of whether a residue is buried or exposed. We thus propose our substitution matrix-based predictions as strong baselines for future abundance model development.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Here we define the pre- and post-synaptic organization of the spinal-projecting serotonergic system and define a role in locomotor control. We show that while forebrain-targeting 5-HT neurons decrease their activity during locomotion, subpopulations of spinal projecting neurons increase their activity in a context-dependent manner. Optogenetic activation of ventrally projecting 5-HT neurons does not trigger initiation of movement, but rather enhances the speed and duration of ongoing locomotion over extended time scales.

We present data obtained with nominal isotropic resolutions ranging from 0.65 to 0.35 mm for partial brain coverage for stimulus evoked responses, and 0.75 mm for whole brain coverage to capture the spontaneous fluctuations that are the source of functional connectivity measures. The increasingly higher nominal resolutions (i.e. smaller voxel volumes and dimensions) employed in image acquisition were shown to correspond to real gains in resolution using image reconstruction methods developed to minimize blurring. Existence of supralinear gains in stimulus-evoked percent signal change and major improvements in statistical significance were evident relative to 7 Tesla, the most advanced commercially available ultrahigh magnetic field platform currently employed in human brain studies. These results were feasible due to gains in intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio, BOLD contrast, and image acceleration provided by the uniquely high magnetic field of 10.5 Tesla, and the use of novel high channel count arrays to capture these gains.

C.; Mobilia, M.", "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared drug protection. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile, spatially structured settings. Migration, space, fluctuations, and environmental variability all have a significant impact on the development and proliferation of AMR. While drug resistance is enhanced by migration in static conditions, this changes in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. Here, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment. This contains a toxin against which protection can be shared (cooperative AMR). Cells migrate between demes and connect them. When the environment and the deme composition vary on the same timescale, strong population bottlenecks cause fluctuation-driven extinction events, countered by migration. We investigate the influence of migration and environmental variability on the AMR eco-evolutionary dynamics by asking at what migration rate fluctuations can help clear resistance and what are the near-optimal environmental conditions ensuring the quasi-certain eradication of resistance in the shortest possible time. By combining analytical and computational tools, we answer these questions by determining when the resistant strain goes extinct across the entire metapopulation. While dispersal generally promotes strain coexistence, here we show that slow-but-nonzero migration can speed up and enhance resistance clearance, and determine the near-optimal conditions for this phenomenon. We discuss the impact of our findings on laboratory-controlled experiments and outline their generalisation to lattices of any spatial dimension.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

In such cases, each biosample is summarized by a quasispecies haplotype rank-abundance vector, rendering traditional statistical methods inapplicable due to the lack of replicates. Quasispecies structure indicators are functions of multinomial parameters, whose asymptotic normality is guaranteed by the ontinuous differentiability of these indicator functions and sufficiently large sample sizes. Accurate variance estimation for these indicators is critical for reliable inference. This study contrasts three approaches for variance estimation: analytical first-order approximations via the Delta method, and variance estimates obtained through Bootstrap resampling (with replacement, infinite population), and through resampling without replacement using the random delete-d jackknife (finite sample). Exact binomial variances of selected proportions are used as benchmarks to calibrate the resampling methods. We analyze the intrinsic sampling properties of each quasispecies indicator using high-depth next-generation sequencing data from a hepatitis C virus (HCV) cell culture experiment. Our results show that while a subset of indicators yield comparable and close variance estimates across methods, metrics highly sensitive to fluctuations in rare haplotype fractions exhibit substantial divergence. Limitations inherent to the resampling methods are discussed. The analytic approach and tests based on normality are finally recommended.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Given that neuronal chloride homeostasis influences excitability, seizure susceptibility, and edema, we examined the developmental and injury-induced regulation of key cation-chloride cotransporters and modulators: NKCC1 (sodium-potassium-2-chloride cotransporter), KCC2 (potassium-chloride cotransporter), and the regulatory kinase SPAK, which are biomarkers of neuronal chloride concentrations. This study is the first to define the spatiotemporal expression and phosphorylation profiles of these proteins in the developing piglet brain. We found a perinatal shift in the ratio of KCC2:NKCC1 across the brain, driven primarily by protein abundance, rather than transcriptional levels. We hypothesized that toddler piglets would exhibit an increase in cortical NKCC1 and SPAK causing hyperexcitability and perhaps explaining their more severe, unilateral cortical damage. Severe TBI induced a transcriptional increase in Slc12a2 and Stk39, and a decrease in Slc12a5 in toddler piglets, but not infant piglets. We further found that infant piglets, not toddler piglets, upregulated SPAK and Tyrosine Receptor Kinase B (TRKB) protein in cortex after TBI, with minimal changes in NKCC1 and KCC2. However, phosphorylated NKCC1 (pNKCC1) was significantly upregulated in surviving cortical neurons after TBI in infant piglets and was unchanged in toddlers, despite more severe injury. These findings suggest that cortical neuronal NKCC1 activation may play a role in post-traumatic excitability or resilience in the immature brain and identify NKCC1 and/or SPAK as a potential therapeutic target. In human tissue, the KCC2:NKCC1 ratio also increased postnatally, and TBI caused region and cell-type specific dysregulation of pNKCC1.

We find that urban birds exhibit duller colourations than forest counterparts, being 10-20% less chromatic, with first-year birds and males being more negatively impacted by cities. Additionally, birds in the city are more sexually dichromatic than in the forest. Over the decade, colouration differences between habitats remain stable, following a similar quadratic temporal pattern. Finally, while climate has a weak effect on colouration, urban birds appear more sensitive to its influence than forest birds. Our results indicate urbanisation has a stronger impact than last decade climatic variation on great tit colouration, though both factors may interact. The heightened sensitivity of first-year birds and increased sexual dichromatism in cities may alter the strength of natural and sexual selection on this trait in urban environments.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

In the Alps, the alpine marmot hibernates for almost 6 months. During that time individuals are sheltered from cold and lack of food, so we could expect alpine marmots to be less responsive to earlier springs than non-hibernating mountain-dwelling species. Here we investigate temporal variation in the date at which pups emerge from their natal burrow for the first time. Using quantile regressions, we provide clear evidence of an earlier pup emergence between 1990 and 2023. Over the study period, the predicted change is of about 4.7 days. In particular, late emergence dates are becoming especially rare over time. Our findings are in line with previous work on other mountain species, which suggests a general advance in reproductive phenology among the organisms living in Alps.

Current GFMs typically treat DNA simplistically as nucleotide-only sequences, overlooking critical biological context, such as genomic annotations, regulatory elements, and functional contexts central to genomic interpretation. Here, we introduce BioToken, a modular and extendable tokenization framework designed to encode genomic variants and biologically relevant region annotations directly into genomic representations. By utilizing intrinsic inductive biases, BioToken facilitates meaningful representation learning and generalization across diverse molecular phenotypes, such as gene expression, alternative splicing, and variant pathogenicity prediction. Built on BioToken, our genomic foundation model, BioFM, achieves competitive or superior results relative to specialized models (e.g., Enformer, SpliceTransformer) and GFMs up to 7B parameters across a comprehensive suite of genomic benchmarks, including noncoding pathogenicity, expression modulation, sQTL prediction, and long-range genomic interactions. Notably, BioFM achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters (265M), substantially reducing training costs and computational requirements.

This preservation likely stems from structural and functional integrity within core language network (cLAN) regions. To investigate this hypothesis, we analyzed the relationships among brain's resting-state functional connectivity (FC), structural connectivity (SC), and language behaviour (LC and LP) using a cross-sectional cohort of healthy adults (N = 652; M/F = 322/330; aged 18-88) from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) dataset. Six cognitive tasks assessing LC and LP were employed, with neuroimaging measures focused on region-specific connections within the cLAN. Using generalized additive mixed models (GAMMs), complex brain-behaviour interactions were identified. Behavioral analyses revealed established age-related dichotomy, LC abilities in vocabulary and proverb comprehension improved and in syntactic and semantic comprehension remained stable, whereas LP tasks, e.g., verbal fluency, picture priming, and tip of tongue exhibited significant decline across the lifespan. SC exhibited decline in both intra- and inter-hemispheric fronto-temporal and frontal lobe connections, contrasted by preserved or enhanced temporal lobe connectivity, supporting a pattern of frontal vulnerability concomitant with temporal resilience. Age-related FC patterns demonstrated overall preservation, reflecting compensatory mechanisms to sustain functional integrity despite structural degradation. GAMM analyses revealed complex relationships between brain connectivity and language performance across age. Thus, integrating knowledge of brain structure, function, and language abilities, we identified the brain network mechanisms associated with dichotomous language behavior along lifespan.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "The timing of developmental transitions is critical for environmental adaptation, allowing organisms to align stress tolerant and sensitive stages with harsh and benign periods, respectively. This timing across seasons (i.e. phenology) is often under spatially-varying selection across climate gradients, and species often exhibit genetic clines in phenology. Clines for transitions like germination and flowering time are well documented; less is known about the juvenile-to-adult vegetative phase change (VPC) - a conserved (among plants) yet visually subtle developmental transition marked by changes in leaf morphology and physiology. Alternatively, developmental tradeoffs can reduce fitness differences between genotypes and promote diversity within populations. Here, we tested 158 diverse genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana under drought during either the juvenile or adult vegetative phases along with well-watered controls. We measured performance, physiology, and timing of developmental transitions. We found strong rank-changing genotype-environment interactions with fitness depending on the stage at which drought occurred, indicating tradeoffs and distinct mechanisms of drought adaptation between different stages. Fitness reductions were generally greater under juvenile drought, suggesting that the juvenile phase is more vulnerable than the adult phase to stress. Adult plants significantly increased water use efficiency in response to drought but juvenile plants did not, consistent with earlier results showing reduced plasticity in the juvenile phase. Genome-wide association mapping revealed candidate loci for the timing of VPC and stage-specific drought responses. Globally, VPC timing was weakly related to climate but in Iberia there was a significant trend of early VPC in seasonally dry climates and late VPC in moist climates. Analysis of global geographic variation in putative QTL showed a strong depletion in SNPs associated with the timing of VPC and juvenile drought fitness, suggesting variation in these loci is maintained within populations due to consistent tradeoffs all across Arabidopsis range. These results demonstrate that the timing of VPC contributes to adaptive responses to drought and that tradeoffs across developmental stages help maintain genetic diversity in natural populations.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

While some host glycan-based cellular receptors for HPIV-3 have been identified, the dynamics of the host cell glycome upon HPIV-3 infection has never been studied. Herein, we report the first mass spectrometry based study that provides direct insight into the remodelling of the human lung adenocarcinoma cell (A549) glycome upon HPIV-3 infection. Our results reveal significant remodelling of host-cell glycome, including increased expression of oligomannose and reduced expression of sialylated complex-type N-glycans. In addition, we observed altered O-glycan expression, with upregulation of core 1 and downregulation of core 2 type structures in infected cells compared to mock-infected controls. HPIV-3 infection also led to distinct remodelling of glycosphingolipid glycans.

By scaling and integrating temporally resolved network analytics and consensus statistical approaches, we identified largely previously uncharacterized microbial species that best predict host physiology following neurological impairment. In silico validation through ''complete'' pathway-centric and comparative genomic analyses revealed that among these species, the major encoded microbial metabolic changes were in pathways directly linked to host nitrogen balance, and they varied by host sex and microbial ecotype/species. Moreover, we identified the exact bacterial species (and their draft genome sequences) driving urease-dependent versus amino acid-dependent nitrogen gut metabolism -- findings that explain previously mechanistically-ambiguous, but clinically relevant, ammonia-driven host nitrogen imbalance.

Although advances in genomic selection scans have greatly improved our ability to detect signatures of adaptation, distinguishing true signals from false positives remains challenging. This task is particularly difficult in regions of reduced recombination, such as polymorphic inversions. In this study, we examine the genome-wide landscape of selection in the European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus), Europe's most destructive forest pest, which has one of the most complex inversion-associated recombination landscapes known. Using simulation-based analyses and whole-genome resequencing data from 312 individuals across 23 populations, we applied two complementary selection scan methods (nSL and {Lambda}) to assess how inversions influence the detection of adaptive signals. Simulations revealed that the two selection scan methods differ in their susceptibility to false-positive signals within inversions and that partitioning data by inversion genotype (i.e., homozygote classes) can substantially reduce these errors. Consistent with the results of our simulations, our empirical data showed that inversions are highly enriched for selection signals when all inversion genotypes are analyzed but are depleted when only homozygotes are considered. This demonstrates that focusing on homozygote genotypes allows for a more precise identification of putative selection targets and haplotype-specific signals, as it overcomes the confounding effects of suppressed recombination in heterokaryotypic individuals. In contrast, the detection of selection in collinear regions was largely unaffected by the presence of inversions. Our findings highlight that inversions may play an important role in shaping adaptation, underscoring the need to account for species-specific genomic architecture when interpreting signals from selection scans.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

As a stable cognitive feature tied to vulnerability across disorders, RNT represents a promising intervention target. Yet, leveraging it as a modifiable mechanism requires deeper insight into its causal neural dynamics and how modulation can promote adaptive change. We present a data-driven framework combining dynamical system reconstruction (DSR) with model predictive control (MPC) to infer optimal control policies for transitions between resting and sad mood brain states using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Nonlinear DSR models trained on individuals with remitted major depressive disorder (rMDD) and healthy controls (HCs) yield region-specific, state-dependent control strategies. Small regions (e.g., sgACC, NAcc) show higher controllability, requiring less energy for state transitions. Notably, rMDD participants need less control energy than HCs to shift into and out of sad mood, though the latter effect is spatially limited. Despite comparable target attainment, they remain closer to the sad mood distribution when returning to rest, reflecting a residual negative-affect bias. Elevated effective coupling in rMDD, especially toward the DLPFC, is linked to lower control energy, suggesting that stronger network influence enables more efficient transitions. These findings indicate rMDD dynamics that ease entry into negative affect but impede full disengagement, underscoring the value of closed-loop control for mechanistic insight and the design of targeted neuromodulatory interventions.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

This division of labor is necessary: rate coding fails to distinguish novel high-saliency from familiar low-saliency stimuli, while synchrony succeeds. We validate this complementary coding across a biologically realistic V1 model and an abstract associative memory network, demonstrating robustness across connectivity regimes and memory loads. Crucially, when inputs are already temporally coordinated through familiarity in a previous network layer, spike synchrony alone can encode both stimulus identity and familiarity. Our findings reconcile the rate-timing debate: familiar stimuli exploit efficient synchrony-based codes reinforced by recurrent connectivity across the cortical hierarchy, while novel stimuli depend on rate codes.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

This study examined whether negative affectivity (such as depressiveness, anxiety, and stress level), conceptualized as both transient states and stable traits, moderates the effects of tDCS on working memory (WM) and associative memory (AM). We pooled data from six sham-controlled experiments involving 144 healthy young adults (351 tDCS sessions) using within-subject crossover designs. Participants completed WM and AM tasks following active anodal tDCS or sham, as well as Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) before each session. We found that trait-level negative affectivity, but not state-level emotional fluctuations, moderated WM. Individuals with higher levels of depression, anxiety, or stress demonstrated greater tDCS-induced WM gains. In contrast, AM benefits were consistent and unaffected by affective traits or states. These findings indicate that psychological traits can shape the variability of tDCS effects. In particular, negative affectivity influences susceptibility to tDCS effects on cognitively demanding tasks that rely heavily on executive control. This effect may stem from negative affectivity's association with downscaled baseline cortical excitability in prefrontal networks, crucial for WM performance, thereby opening the possibility of greater tDCS-induced improvement. These findings provide further support to our growing understanding of the complex interplay between emotional and cognitive processes in shaping individual responses to tDCS and point out that negative affectivity should be taken into consideration when evaluating individual variability of the tDCS (and other non-invasive brain stimulation techniques) effects on memory and cognition.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

While cellular populations reaching confluence are known to have limited sensitivity to ferroptosis, an understanding of the interplay between growth dynamics, ROS levels and ferroptosis is currently lacking. Here we use live-cell imaging coupled to ROS tracing to reveal a feedback loop between population growth and ferroptotic cell death. Starting out from the observation that the cellular proliferation rate declines with increased cellular density, we find that ROS levels also decline with increasing cellular density. Low ROS levels make cells insensitive to ferroptosis, which in turn enables population growth. This feedback produces two steady states: (i) a ferroptosis-insensitive state characterized by slow growth, low levels of ROS and low rates of cell death and (ii) a ferroptosis-sensitive state characterized by rapid growth, ROS accumulation, and high rates of ferroptosis. Interestingly, triggering effective ferroptosis by interfering with GPX4 activity is directly linked with this mechanism. On the other hand, keeping cell numbers and drug concentration/cell constant while restricting growth space led to reduced proliferation, reduced ROS and decreased ferroptotic cell death. Importantly, ferroptosis resistance at high cellular confluency could be broken by increasing cellular ROS and lipid ROS through a galactose-promoted OXPHOS switch. A mathematical model of the feedback mechanism predicts the long-term fate of populations as well as their ferroptosis sensitivity when external conditions impacting cell proliferation rates, ROS, or both are changed.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

The latter exhibits a uniform anthocyanin content, whereas photosensitive eggplants lack anthocyanin accumulation in areas not exposed to light, such as under the calyx, or have lower concentrations in less-exposed areas. In the current research work, genetic analysis of F1 and F2 populations revealed that the non-photosensitive phenotype in eggplants follows an autosomal dominant inheritance with a 3:1 ratio, indicating that the photosensitive trait is regulated by a single dominant gene. To locate and narrow down the position of the gene underlying photosensitivity, an F2 population segregating for photosensitivity and presence of anthocyanins was used for bulked segregant analysis sequencing (BSA-seq), and RNA-seq analysis of bagged photosensitive and non-photosensitive eggplants was performed. As a result, we identified the SmNAC1-like gene as a candidate for fruit photosensitivity trait in the eggplant materials used in this study. In the photo-insensitive eggplants (DH-ECAVI and IVIA-371) two different high-impact mutations were identified leading to light-insensitive and uniform anthocyanin content.

We also used the activity marker Fos to test whether buprenorphine inhibition of incubation of heroin seeking is associated with decreased activation of cortical and striatal regions. Methods: We trained Oprm1-Cre rats and their wild-type littermates to self-administer heroin for 12 days (6 h/day). On abstinence Day 1, we tested for heroin seeking under extinction conditions. On Day 14, we implanted osmotic minipumps containing saline or buprenorphine (6 mg/kg/day).

In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of the nitrogenase system nifH promoter (PnifH) in driving expression of distinct fluorescent reporters; superfolder yellow fluorescent protein (sfYFP), superfolder cyan fluorescent protein (sfCFP), and various red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) within root nodules of determinate (Lotus japonicus-Mesorhizobium japonicum) and indeterminate (Pisum sativum-Rhizobium leguminosarum) systems. We show that PnifH-driven sfYFP and sfCFP yield strong, uniform, and reproducible fluorescence in nodules of both systems, facilitating reliable quantification of nodulation traits and strain occupancy. In contrast, RFPs including monomeric (mScarlet-I, mRFP1, mARs1) and multimeric (Azami Red1.0) variants exhibited weak or inconsistent signals in pea. Notably, fluorescent labeling did not impair rhizobial competitiveness for root nodule occupancy, and PnifH-driven sfYFP and sfCFP reporters enabled robust multiplexed imaging in single-root and split-root assays. In the lotus, mScarlet-I worked robustly and facilitated a tripartite strain labeling system. Complementing our molecular toolkit, we established a deep learning-based analytical pipeline for high-throughput, automated quantification of nodulation traits, validated against standard ImageJ analysis. Altogether, our results identify PnifH-driven sfYFP and sfCFP as robust, broadly applicable reporters for legume-rhizobia symbiosis studies, while highlighting the need for optimized red fluorophores in some contexts.

S.", "abstract": "Although existing next-generation sequencing (NGS) tools, such as Aldy and Cyrius, have been applied for allele typing, they cannot achieve complete accuracy due to various genomic challenges including pseudogenes, structural variations, hybrid genes, copy number variations, and gene deletions. These complexities make accurate pharmacogene interpretation more challenging, despite the crucial role pharmacogenomics plays in precision medicine. We developed deCYPher, a tool that generates personalized pharmacogenomic reports from haplotype-resolved assemblies. The tool enables analysis of all PharmVar 1A level genes, such as CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, CYP4F2, DPYD, NUDT15, and SLCO1B1. Applied to all HPRC haplotypes (including both release 1 and release 2 data), deCYPher demonstrated high accuracy in resolving complex gene structures. In the case of CYP2D6, release 1 identified 6% gene multiplications, 6% full gene deletions, and 4% CYP2D6/CYP2D7 hybrids. By contrast, release 2 demonstrated an increased prevalence of multiplications (14%) and hybrids (11%), while the frequency of full gene deletions remained comparable at 5%. Comparison with pb-StarPhase revealed discrepancies in 12 of 94 assemblies in the release 1 dataset. For instance, in sample HG02257, Aldy, Cyrius, and deCYPher consistently identified the genotype as *2/*35, whereas pb-StarPhase reported *2/*2. Notably, the *35-defining variants were present in the BAM and VCF files in the pb-StarPhase pipeline, but the local read depth over the *35-specific region was only 5x in HG02257-p, suggesting that the misclassification likely resulted from insufficient coverage - a known limitation of pb-StarPhase under low-depth conditions.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

This study elucidates the manganese homeostasis system in S. maltophilia strain Sm18, a Mexican environmental isolate, revealing a sophisticated network that includes both conserved and novel components. We focus on the MntR miniregulon, which comprises the well-known inner-membrane importer MntH and exporter MntP, regulated by the Mn2+-responsive MntR metalloregulator. However, it also contains a TonB-dependent receptor (TBDR) with a distinctive CQNC motif likely involved in Mn2+ coordination and a periplasmic thioredoxin-fold protein (TFP). Both are coexpressed from a bicistronic operon under severe manganese and iron limitation and belong to novel families with a limited phyletic distribution. Transcriptomic profiling under varying manganese and iron concentrations revealed a tight interplay between these metals, emphasizing the ferrophilic nature of S. maltophilia and the differential expression of the MntR miniregulon core members. Additional transporters of the RND and CDF families were also modulated under dual metal limitation. Mutant analysis demonstrated that MntP is critical for survival, even at Mn levels that do not affect growth kinetics. MntH is required for optimal intracellular replication within Acanthamoeba castellanii phagosomes, highlighting its role in overcoming nutritional immunity.

Every organism requires a minimum intake to meet maintenance needs, and every trophic transfer dissipates part of the energy flow as heat. Classical theory has emphasized lower bounds on supply---the minimum resource level required for consumers to persist---yet the possible upper bounds and their role in limiting food-chain length remain unclear. We develop a thermodynamically grounded framework that reveals a triad of boundaries: (i) consumer thresholds, (ii) a basal protection limit that reframes the paradox of enrichment as a thermodynamic constraint, and (iii) environmental or physiological supply caps. We show that the intersection of these three boundaries determines the exact range of conditions under which a given ecosystem structure can occur, and that within this range trophic configurations arise as the unique solution that maximizes energy flow. As chain length increases, consumer thresholds rise while the basal protection limit falls, causing this range to contract and eventually disappear. Whether this limit is reached depends on the relative position of these two boundaries and the external supply cap. Their crossing defines an energetic ceiling: a thermodynamic bound on food-chain length beyond which no further level can be sustained. Our results show that feasibility conditions are directly shaped by thermodynamic laws, providing a mechanistic explanation for the emergence and limits of trophic systems.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

K.; Verbakel, L.; von Philipsborn, A. C.; Wolfner, M. F.; Clark, A. G.", "abstract": "Reproductive proteins often diverge rapidly between species, yet network function must be maintained. Shared selective pressures on network members and compensatory changes between members can drive their parallel evolutionary trajectories. Indeed, correlated evolutionary rates of amino acid sequence change have been observed for interacting reproductive proteins. But whether gene copy number changes also correlate has not been widely studied. Here, we investigated copy number variation (CNV) of genes in the Drosophila Sex Peptide Seminal Fluid Protein (Sfp) network. Previous research analyzed CNV of the Sfp Sex Peptide (SP) in Drosophila species. We focus on 9 other Sfps whose function is required to mediate the binding of SP to sperm in D. melanogaster which is required for persistence of female post-mating responses. To exhaustively annotate CNV of genes, we developed a computational pipeline pairing iterative protein queries to genome sequence searches with phylogenetic clustering to resolve homology relationships. We observed that the Sfp networks genes are ancestral to Drosophila and that there were repeated duplications and losses of network members across the genus. We detect statistically significant correlations in gene duplication or loss events among network proteins, and show this can be used to identify new members of the network. We also investigated CNV of female-derived proteins that act downstream of the SP sperm-binding network to modulate SP function, these proteins showed no significant correlation of gene turnover events with SP or its network. Our results provide insight into how evolving reproductive genes tolerate duplication and loss, and how network relationships could constrain reproductive protein evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementReproductive proteins often diverge rapidly between species, yet network function must be maintained. Shared selective pressures on network members and compensatory changes between members can drive their parallel evolutionary trajectories. We report correlated gene duplication and loss among members of the Drosophila Sex Peptide seminal fluid protein network, suggesting that duplication or loss events may drive corresponding events in other network genes. This work is a natural extension of the idea of evolutionary rate covariation, but instead of scoring rates of substitution it tracks correlated duplication and loss events on the phylogeny. Applied to the Sex Peptide network, the method reveals striking patterns, especially for coordinated loss, and identifies a new network gene that is experimentally confirmed.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Recently, pathogenic variants in the human gene encoding the WD Repeat Domain 72 protein (WDR72) have been reported in patients with dRTA, yet the physiological role of WDR72 in the kidney remains unknown.\n\nMethodsTo elucidate the renal function of Wdr72, we generated a kidney-specific knockout mouse model (Wdr72fl/fl;Pax8-Cre+) and assessed acid-base homeostasis under baseline, acute, and chronic acid loading.\n\nResultsWdr72fl/fl;Pax8-Cre+ mice displayed persistently elevated urinary pH, reduced titratable acid and net acid excretion under basal and acid-loaded conditions, consistent with incomplete dRTA. While the systemic pH remained unchanged compared to controls under standard diet, chronic acid load led to mild hyperchloremic, hypokalemic metabolic acidosis. Notably, urinary NH excretion was increased upon acid loading accompanied by upregulation of key ammoniagenesis enzymes, which was detected even under basal conditions, consistent with a compensatory activation of proximal tubular acid excretion pathways. The total and apical abundance of the V-ATPase B1 subunit decreased markedly within the kidney, despite unchanged transcript levels, suggesting a defect in V-ATPase trafficking or assembly. In addition, morphometric analyses revealed an increased proportion of smaller type A intercalating cells that failed to expand upon acid loading, indicating defective adaptive plasticity.\n\nConclusionsKidney-specific Wdr72 deletion impairs distal urinary acidification through reduced V-ATPase abundance and apical targeting, altered intercalated cell morphology, and limited adaptive remodeling, resulting in incomplete dRTA. Upregulation of renal ammoniagenesis partially compensates the acidification defect. These findings highlight WDR72 as a key regulator of distal nephron acid-base homeostasis and offer mechanistic insight into WDR72-associated dRTA.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Because the mechanical sector includes an inertial-viscoelastic element, the coupled system supports two underdamped normal modes whose interference defines a measurable slow cadence fslow = ({omega}+,r -{omega} -,r)/(2{pi}). Sampling the dynamics at the neutral moment (the recurring near-symmetric crossing between the two sectors) produces an even circle map (mod{pi} ) for the slow phase, with effective forcing {Omega} and coupling K2. Both {Omega} and K2 can be computed a priori from directly measurable electrical and mechanical properties of the tissue (membrane time constant{tau} m, cortical stiffness{kappa} , viscosity , effective areal inertia{rho} eff, diffusion constants DV, D{sigma}, and weak electromechanical gains{gamma} , {beta}R, {beta}I), without arbitrary integer fitting. Helical quantization then appears as a mode-locking problem: the canonical B-DNA rotation number n {approx} 10.5 corresponds to the high-order lock{rho}{pi} = 2/21, whose center in this even (mod{pi} ) convention is {Omega}2/21 ={pi} {middle dot} 2/21 {approx} 0.2992 rad.\n\nWe define a functional order parameter {Lambda} as the cross-spectral coherence CV {sigma}(fslow) between V and{sigma} at fslow.

However, the processes by which these internally guided decisions are formed and translated into action remain unclear. We tested whether neural signatures of evidence accumulation and motor preparation - established in perceptual decision-making - are also observed during voluntary decisions. Forty-nine adults made voluntary (free choice between two options) and forced (single specified choice) decisions while electroencephalography was recorded. To isolate decision formation from action selection, all responses were made with a right-handed keypress. After applying signal deconvolution and current source density transformations, we examined three signals: the centro-parietal positivity (CPP), Mu/Beta (8 - 30 Hz) amplitudes, and a left-hemisphere readiness potential contralateral to the response hand. For both voluntary and forced decisions, CPP and Mu/Beta amplitudes showed hallmark accumulation-to-bound dynamics - faster responses had steeper ramping signals that converged to stereotyped pre-response amplitude levels. The left-hemisphere readiness potential likewise showed convergence to a pre-response level but with less reliable evidence for RT-dependent slope scaling, resembling a late, effector-specific motor gate rather than an evolving decision variable. Waveform amplitudes across the time course of these signals also did not differ reliably between voluntary and forced decisions. Our results indicate that, like perceptual decisions, voluntary choices are also formed by a graded accumulation process that culminates in a motor action, with the CPP indexing an evolving decision variable and Mu/Beta indexing effector-specific motor readiness.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

When the proteasome function is impaired due to cellular stress like mutations, chemicals or epigenetic stressors, there is accumulation of unfolded or misfolded, ubiquitinated proteins leading to cellular toxicity. Cells combat this rise in cellular toxicity by sequestering ubiquinated proteins in a transient cellular structure called the aggresome. The transport of this ubquitinated protein cargo along the microtubules to form aggresomes and their clearance from cells by autophagy is called the aggresome processing pathway (APP). APP activation is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases and has also been implicated in Influenza A Virus uncoating step. To study the dynamics of APP and the compositional diversity of the aggresome, we used time-dependent proximity labeling, mass spectrometry, and immunofluorescence microscopy. Here, we used vimentin (VIM) and histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6), two established aggresome markers as baits to visualize aggresome formation and clearance in HeLa cells. We identified more than 75 novel components of mature aggresome.

Identifying subtle precursors to missed alerts remains an open problem with both practical and computational significance. To address this, we recorded detection dogs on a treadmill-based scent delivery system under tightly controlled conditions, enabling precise timing of odor presentation. We focused on the 4.5 seconds preceding each odor pulse to capture anticipatory movement through video and physiological state via sensors. Using markerless pose estimation, we extracted high-resolution joint trajectories, while concurrent recordings provided heart rate, heart rate variability, and core temperature. We trained a spatiotemporal deep learning model that integrates Graph Attention Networks and Temporal Convolutional Networks to predict missed indications from these short, pre-stimulus windows. The model successfully identified 85% of missed alerts with 81% precision. Heart rate variability emerged as the most informative physiological input, suggesting a strong autonomic component to declining readiness. To move from isolated predictions to actionable insights, we implemented a Bayesian aggregation framework that estimates each dogs latent miss rate over time. This probabilistic formulation enables adaptation to individual baselines and operational risk thresholds, supporting context-sensitive deployment decisions.

CD133 localizes to plasma membrane protrusions and lipid rafts, maintaining membrane architecture, promoting EV release, and shaping selective protein loading, including the pro-angiogenic factor CD105. Functionally, CD133 EVs potently induce endothelial tubulogenesis in a CD105-dependent manner, independently of EV uptake or endothelial proliferation. In vivo, these EVs preferentially accumulate in the lung and liver, highlighting organ-specific communication.

Sheep have a similar physiology and anatomy to humans, providing the standard model for demonstrating biocompatibility and performance of biological heart valves to obtain regulatory approval for their use in transplantation. Like most mammals, sheep cells contain two well-characterized carbohydrate epitopes, galactose-1,3-galactose (-Gal) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), which are absent in humans. Formation of these xenoantigens is catalysed by two enzymes, namely (1,3) galactosyltransferase (GGTA1) and CMP-Neu5Gc hydroxylase (CMAH), respectively. Towards generating new sheep models, we used Cas9-mediated genome editing in both male and female ovine fetal fibroblasts to knockout (KO) both alleles of CMAH and GGTA1. Selected double KO (DKO) fibroblast strains were used for somatic cell transfer cloning to produce blastocysts that were transferred into gestational surrogate ewes. Following transfer of 128 male and 40 female cloned blastocysts, 6 male and 8 female lambs were born, however, none of the males survived. Molecular analyses of cells from the five surviving ewes confirmed their compound heterozygous state, resulting in a functional DKO phenotype and subsequent immune rejection of embryonic tissues during natural breeding with wild-type rams. This new DKO sheep model better mimics the human immune status, offering greater physiological relevance for preclinical testing of biological heart valves, alleviation of red meat allergy syndrome due to the presence of dietary xenoantigens, and an alternative source of donor organs that may be culturally more widely accepted than pigs.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Although receptor phosphorylation is known to influence GLP-1R signalling, its functional relevance in {beta}-cells remains incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the role of three C-terminal serine doublets (Ser441/442, Ser444/445, Ser451/452) in the human receptor using site-directed mutagenesis in INS-1 832/3 {beta}-cells deleted for endogenous GLP-1R expression. GLP-1 stimulation induced serine phosphorylation of wild-type GLP-1R, which was abolished in all individual doublet as well as triple doublet phospho-null mutants. Basal phosphorylation was detected in wild-type receptors under unstimulated conditions, suggesting dynamic cycling between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated states. All mutant receptors trafficked normally to the plasma membrane, but the triple alanine doublet (AA) mutant exhibited reduced GLP-1-induced internalisation and significantly decreased plasma membrane diffusion under vehicle conditions, indicating altered receptor dynamics even in the absence of agonist. Importantly, the Ser451/452 doublet was required for GRK2 recruitment to the active GLP-1R. Functionally, the triple AA mutant showed impaired GLP-1-induced cAMP generation with minimal change in {beta}-arrestin 2 recruitment, resulting in biased signalling. The cAMP defect was partially rescued by phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibition with rolipram, implicating altered PDE engagement in the defective cAMP response. These findings demonstrate that both basal and agonist-induced GLP-1R phosphorylation are critical for receptor signalling in {beta}-cells, revealing a previously unappreciated role for basal phosphorylation in shaping receptor behaviour and establishing a positive link between GLP-1R phosphorylation and {beta}-cell signalling competence.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

To precisely interrogate these processes in living systems, we developed a genetically encoded optogenetic toolkit for spatiotemporal control of MT organization and dynamics. By replacing native multimerization motifs with a blue light-responsive oligoermization domain, we have engineered single-component probes, OptoMT and OptoTIP, that reversibly label MT polymers or track plus-ends with tunable kinetics from seconds to minutes. When coupled to enzymatic effectors, these modules enable localized tubulin acetylation or detyrosination, directly linking PTMs to MT stability. We further engineered OptoMotor, a light-activatable kinesin platform that reconstitutes tail-dependent cargo transport along MTs, and OptoSAW, a light-triggered severing actuator for controlled MT disassembly. Using these tools, we reveal how local MT integrity governs lysosomal trafficking and ER-associated signaling dynamics.

The axon guidance cue Netrin-1 promotes MuSC protrusion outgrowth ex vivo in a manner dependent on its receptors Dcc and Neogenin, the small GTPase Rac1, and the actin-branching factor Arp2/3, each of which is also required for Netrin-dependent axonal growth cone motility.

L.; Potchanant, E. A. S.; Huot, J. R.; Raghav, R.; Chin, M. T.; Conway, S. J.; Brault, J. J.", "abstract": "Background: Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare X-linked mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations in the TAFAZZIN gene, which disrupts cardiolipin (CL) remodeling and mitochondrial function. While cardiac manifestations of BTHS are well characterized, the mechanisms underlying skeletal muscle weakness and fatigability are poorly understood. Methods: We investigated neuromuscular and mitochondrial alterations in a novel murine model (TazPM) carrying a patient-derived D75H point mutation in Tafazzin. This mutation preserves protein abundance but abolishes enzymatic activity. Skeletal muscle function was assessed via weightlifting and hanging tests. Muscle fiber composition and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) integrity were evaluated using immunofluorescence, western blotting, and in vivo electrophysiology. Mitochondrial morphology was examined by transmission electron microscopy, and bioenergetics were quantified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Stress signaling was assessed by western blotting. Results: Male TazPM mice exhibited elevated monolysocardiolipin and reduced mature CL levels, confirming deficient transacylase activity. These mice exhibited lower muscle strength and endurance, smaller muscle fibers of all types, and a shift toward fast-twitch type 2B fibers, which are more susceptible to fatigue. Electrophysiological analysis revealed a 60% reduction in motor unit number and an increase in average single motor unit potential, indicating motor neuron remodeling. NMJ protein analysis showed decreased MUSK and DOK7 and increased CHRNA1, suggesting impaired NMJ integrity. Despite mitochondrial structural abnormalities and reduced expression of key mitochondrial proteins (NDUFB8, MCU, TMEM65), resting ATP, phosphocreatine, and adenine nucleotide ratios were unchanged in both glycolytic and oxidative muscles. However, stress signaling pathways were markedly activated, including phosphorylation of eIF2, increased CHOP, DELE1, p53 expression, and altered Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling components. Conclusions: Deficiency of Tafazzin enzymatic activity in skeletal muscle is sufficient to result in widespread neuromuscular remodeling, including fiber size/type shifts, motor unit loss, NMJ dysregulation, and stress pathway activation, without overt energetic failure at rest. These findings suggest that myopathy in BTHS arises not solely from mitochondrial ATP insufficiency but rather from cumulative structural and signaling disruptions.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Meiocyte-specific transcriptomics combined with genome-wide binding analyses revealed that recombination genes, including the crossover-promoting helicase MER3, are direct DREAM targets.

The protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) exhibits biased signaling in response to thrombin and activated protein C (APC). APC-induced B-arrestin-2 (Barr2) biased signaling requires PAR1 compartmentalization in caveolae, a subtype of lipid rafts, whereas thrombin-activated PAR1 G protein signaling does not. Caveolin-1 (Cav1) is the principal structural protein of caveolae and regulates signaling through protein-protein interactions. The mechanisms by which Cav1 contributes to APC/PAR1-induced Barr2 biased signaling is not known. Here we report that APC-activated PAR1 modulates Cav1 phosphorylation via a Barr2- and c-Src- dependent pathway. APC also regulates the dynamics of endogenous PAR1-Cav1 and GRK5-Cav1 co-localization examined by single molecule super-resolution stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy imaging in human cultured endothelial cells. We further demonstrate that GRK5 interacts with Cav1 in intact cells through an N-terminus aromatic-rich consensus Cav1 binding motif. Unlike wildtype GRK5, a GRK5 mutant defective in Cav1 binding localized predominantly to the cytoplasm rather than the plasma membrane and failed to promote Barr2 recruitment to APC-activated PAR1.

Some organisms excise transposons from their somatic genomes via programmed DNA elimination yet paradoxically retain them in their germline. The evolutionary rationale for this selective retention remains poorly understood. To address this, we first set out to develop a germline enrichment method in Paramecium tetraurelia, since the somatic DNA is several hundred times more abundant than the transposon-rich germline. Our approach improved the germline assembly significantly by reducing the number of contigs from the previously published 26186 to just 179, close to the expected chromosomal count. Contrary to the view that the germline serves merely for transgenerational genome propagation, long-read sequencing of poly(A)+ RNA uncovered abundant coding transcripts derived from germline-limited DNA. Furthermore, we detected numerous modified somatic transcripts caused by incorporation of ultrashort transposon remnants from germline sequences. Notably, these insertions show a size bias that preserves open reading frames, consistent with translation mediated quality control. Together, our results suggest that the germ-soma nuclear dimorphism serves as an intrinsic system for the emergence of genome innovations and transcriptome diversification through the retention of germline-limited sequences.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

In contrast, the non-canonical inflammasome detects bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) through CASP4/5, which cleave GSDMD to drive pyroptosis. While CASP1 substrates are well characterized, CASP4/5 substrates remain less defined. Here, we show that in response to intracellular LPS and gram-negative bacterial infection, CASP4/5 directly cleave and activate the executioner caspases CASP3/7. CASP3 in turn cleaves and activates gasdermin E (GSDME). Surprisingly, CASP3, but not GSDME, was required for restricting intracellular Salmonella replication, suggesting that CASP4/5-induced apoptosis contributes to host defense. We further show that most GSDMD cleavage during non-canonical inflammasome activation is mediated by CASP1, and that GSDMD is the primary driver of pyroptosis. Finally, we confirm that CASP4/5 activate CASP3/7 and GSDME in human primary macrophages.

Here we examine the effects of costimulatory (CD80, CD86) and inhibitory (PD-L1) ligands on the nucleation propensity of LAT condensation. We utilize single molecule mobility tracking to resolve the moment a pMHC molecule binds to TCR combined with intracellular imaging to measure the time delay between pMHC:TCR binding and nucleation of the corresponding LAT condensate. These delay time distributions reflect the propensity function for stochastic nucleation of the LAT condensate and provide a measure of the effective signal strength from a single, activated TCR. The results reveal that CD28 stimulation by CD80 or CD86 causes a distinct reduction in the mean delay time to LAT condensation while PD-L1 is mildly antagonistic to the process. Collectively, these observations strengthen evidence that probability and timing of the LAT nucleation process itself is tightly associated with signal propagation downstream from individual TCR activation events.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Viral infection induces dysbiosis by modulating microbiome diversity. Although distinct variants produce independent symptoms and viral loads, their impact on the nasopharyngeal microbiota and host inflammatory profile remains poorly understood. To address this, we analyzed nasopharyngeal samples from Chilean individuals collected during different phases of the pandemic.

Monitoring of pHmed showed that loss of NRT2.1 largely prevented nitrate induced alkalization of the media, while loss of NRT1.1A/B reduced media alkalization only during the initial stages of nitrate uptake. Use of the pH sensitive dye HPTS showed that pHapo of root cells decreased during nitrate uptake, and this affect was partly attenuated in the nitrate transporter mutants. To explain the discrepancies between the observed changes in pHmed and pHapo during nitrate uptake, we propose the following model. We suggest that the depletion of protons in the media that occurs during nitrate symport is offset by the buffering of protons in the cell wall and the activity of the H+-ATPase, allowing a lower pHapo to be maintained.

Yet, many traditional methods for quantifying plant traits are time-consuming and resource-intensive, limiting sample sizes and study durations. In response, high-throughput phenotyping--specifically reflectance spectroscopy-- has emerged as a key element of plant trait research, capable of estimating plant traits more rapidly.

To investigate the neural basis supporting context-dependent sensory processing we developed a behavioral task in which mice changed their response to a single whisker deflection according to a continuously present contextual cue. Through unbiased optogenetic inactivation mapping, we found that neuronal activity in sensory and motor cortices contributed to task execution and, interestingly, we uncovered an unexpected role of retrosplenial cortex for contextual integration. Widefield calcium imaging revealed that retrosplenial cortex was the first cortical area to show context discrimination in response to the whisker stimulus, followed by whisker motor cortex. Finally, we combined optogenetic inactivation with calcium imaging to define causal context-dependent changes in sensorimotor processing. Our cortex-wide mapping experiments thus begin to define key cortical nodes for context-dependent sensorimotor transformation and highlight an important contribution of retrosplenial cortex.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Milk- versus serum-adapted bacteria show gross differences in envelope physical properties, membrane fatty acid composition and rigidity, and pigment production, and display distinct proteomic profiles. Compared to serum, milk adaptation of S. aureus confers extreme resistance to ROS damage, pronounced antimicrobial tolerance, and accelerated killing in an insect infection model. High level S. aureus pigmentation in whole milk is stimulated by milk lipids, and is responsible for high ROS resistance. The remarkable robustness of S. aureus in a milk biotope may signal the need to adjust antibiotic regimens when treating mastitis infections in humans and livestock.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Honey bees provide a tractable model for host-microbe studies.

Specifically, we focused on primary gut microbiota metabolites present in gnotobiotic bees. Our findings reveal distinct volatilome profiles in honey bees that depend on their gut bacterial colonization state. We cross-validated our findings using an established metabolomics technique, LC-HRMS, to compare and contrast the metabolites detectable with each mass spectrometry-based method. Finally, we assessed the ability of SESI-HRMS to detect colonization with the bee pathogen S. marcescens. By comparing the volatile signature of this bacterium grown in liquid culture with that of infected honey bee headspace, we identified overlapping compounds, including butane-2,3-diol, that were absent in uninfected bees. SESI-HRMS volatilomics, paired with LC-HRMS, therefore has potential to identify non-invasive biomarkers of bee microbiome composition and infection at the level of individual insects.

F.; Frederica, C. F.; Kudoh, H.; Buzas, D. M. M.", "abstract": "Some biological responses persist long after the initial stimulus has disappeared--a phenomenon known as cellular memory. In its long-term form, cellular memory often reflects interactions between cis-acting chromatin states and diffusible trans-acting regulators, which are experimentally difficult to separate in vivo. A key challenge is to develop a quantitative framework that captures cellular memory length even without prior mechanistic knowledge. The FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) gene illustrates this problem and opportunity: a Polycomb/Trithorax cis-acting chromatin switch at FLC produces bistable ON/OFF transcriptional states, while trans-acting factors such as VIN3 and FT modulate transitions between those states. In laboratory studies, FLC memory is classically viewed as persistence of repression or activation after the inducing signal disappears; field studies additionally show that FLC integrates fluctuating temperatures over past intervals, revealing time-integrative mode of memory. To quantify such long-term effects systematically, we formalized the thermal memory interval (TMI), the time window of past environmental cues that best predicts current gene expression--as a transferable metric. We applied TMI to the VIN3-FLC-FT module in two perennial Brassicaceae with divergent life histories Arabidopsis halleri gemmifera, an established ecological model, and Eutrema japonicum, introduced here to identify features generalizable beyond a single species. Using long-term expression and meteorological data, TMIs distinguished spring versus autumn FLC states and revealed distributed memory across the VIN3-FLC-FT network, with intervals from 1-150 days, extending previously reported FLC timescales. While TMIs require dense time-series data and do not by themselves reveal molecular mechanism, they offer a robust, quantitative, and generalizable framework: TMIs can be extended to other genes and to alternative environmental or physiological variables, enabling direct, comparative quantification of cellular memory across genes, species, and contexts.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Additionally, we show that changes in arousal (both mean and variability of the pupil baseline) predict changes in behavioural state.

Using radiolabeled phage DNA and time-lapse microscopy to track phage genomes we demonstrate that SNIPE directly cleaves phage DNA during genome injection. Based on proximity labeling, we find that SNIPE associates with host proteins essential for {lambda} genome entry and with the {lambda} tape measure protein, which facilitates {lambda} genome injection across the inner membrane. SNIPE also defends against diverse siphoviruses, likely through direct interactions with their tape measure proteins.

Most reported PROTACs recruit ubiquitously expressed E3 ligases, such as cereblon and the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor. Of the additional 600+ E3 ligases, recruiting those with tissue-restricted expression is attractive for increasing the specificity of PROTACs. To this end, tissue-specific E3 ligases or E3 ligase-associated proteins that can be recruited for targeted protein degradation need to be identified. This work describes the first reported PROTAC that recruits the tissue-specific E3 ligase scaffolding protein MAGEA11. As an initial demonstration, a library of bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET)-targeting PROTACs that recruit MAGEA11 was synthesized. The library was screened in osteosarcoma U2OS cells, identifying lead compound 105B. 105B potently degrades BET proteins in U2OS osteosarcoma cell lines (BRD4 DC50 = 0.130 nM, Dmax = 78%) and KYSE180 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (DC50 = 40 nM, Dmax = 70%), but shows no degradation in non-cancerous, MAGEA11-deficient HEK293T cells. Mechanistic studies confirmed 105B's dependence on the ubiquitin-proteasome system and engagement of both MAGEA11 and BRD4. 105B decreased levels of BET-regulated gene products c-Myc, RUNX2, and KRT14; however, improvements are still necessary to affect selective cytotoxicity.

Twelve healthy sows were divided equally into pregnant and non-pregnant groups. Blood samples were collected from day 0 to day 42 post-insemination at weekly intervals, and plasma concentrations of cytokines IFN, IL;, ILRA, and TNF were quantified using ELISA.A significant (p < 0.05) progressive increase was observed in all cytokines in pregnant pigs, indicating active immunomodulation during early gestation. IFN, IL, and TNF showed sharp elevations, reflecting their roles in endometrial receptivity, inflammation, and trophoblast invasion. Concurrently, ILRA, IL4 and IL10 exhibited marked increases, suggesting an anti-inflammatory shift crucial for maternal-fetal immune tolerance. The coordinated rise of IL6, IL8, IL12, and IL18 further indicated involvement in vascular remodeling and angiogenesis essential for placental development. In contrast, non-pregnant pigs displayed stable cytokine levels across all sampling points, confirming the absence of immune activation or inflammatory stimuli. These findings demonstrate that successful implantation in pigs is governed by a dynamic cytokine network balancing pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators.

Here, we provide evidence of genetic background playing a key role in this process. Using A/J and C57BL/6J mice known for their distinct susceptibility to AHR, we show that A/J but not C57BL/6J develop an aberrant airway smooth muscle (SM) program and AHR in adulthood when exposed transiently to a vitamin A/retinoic acid (RA)-disrupted intrauterine environment in vivo by a maternal BMS493 administration. Single nuclei multiomics analysis identified a subpopulation of mesenchymal cells that overactivated TGF{beta} targets in response to BMS selectively in A/J, but not C57BL/6J, embryonic lungs. These cells, localized to sites of airway SM initiation, exhibited robust BMS-mediated upregulation of SMAD2/3 targets, including regulators of SM program Pdgfra and Tnc, and showed stable cell proportions despite the marked transcriptional rewiring following RA disruption.

Methods: We performed whole-genome sequencing of CRFK and PG-4 cells. We analyzed the resulting data to infer the phenotype of the individual from which the cells were derived, specifically for the coat color, coat length, coat pattern, and iris color. Results: Our data suggested that CRFK cells originated from a cat with long chocolate-brown fur lacking stripes and with non-blue irises; PG-4 cells originated from a cat with long bicolored white and dark brown fur without stripes, and with non-blue irises. Analysis of publicly available RNA-seq data confirmed that genes associated with coat phenotype and iris color are expressed in the skin and eyes, as well as in various other organs. Conclusions and relevance: Variants of the genes affecting coat phenotype and iris color may influence physiological functions throughout the body. These results shed light on the previously unknown genetic background of commonly used feline cultured cells and the phenotype of the donor individuals. These insights may facilitate a more accurate interpretation of data derived from feline cultured cells and inform guidelines to establish cell lines with various genotypes (for example, disease-associated variants) through genome editing, which will help elucidate genetic factors affecting resistance to infectious diseases and cancer, the risk of internal organ afflictions, and genetic diseases such as deafness in cats with white fur and blue irises.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Patients with ICI-AIN often have T cell-dominant infiltration of the kidney and high tissue levels of CXCR3 ligands like CXCL9, 10, and 11; however, the mechanisms of inflammation in ICI-AIN are not well-understood. Methods: We applied a sub-cellular spatial transcriptomics platform (Xenium Prime 5K) to compare the cellular composition of kidney biopsy tissue from patients with ICI-AIN with ICI-treated patients with acute tubular necrosis (ICI-ATN). Results: Across 8 kidney biopsy specimens (4 with ICI-AIN, 4 with ICI-ATN), we analyzed 332,000 cells, comprising kidney parenchymal cells and infiltrating immune cells. Using a spatially-aware cellular neighborhood-based classification, we identified cellular niches corresponding to each part of the nephron, in addition to unique fibrotic and inflammatory niches. Gene pathway analysis identified interferon-gamma (IFN-{gamma})/STAT1 signaling as strongly increased in ICI-AIN compared to ICI-ATN. While all inflammatory niches were overrepresented in ICI-AIN, CD8+ T cell infiltration and proinflammatory myeloid cells were the dominant immune niches. Spatial niche crosstalk analysis revealed that CD8+ T cell-derived IFN-{gamma} likely induced a proinflammatory program in myeloid cells, with increased production of CXCL9, 10, and 11. Furthermore, IFN-{gamma} signaling in ICI-AIN was associated with reduced oxidative phosphorylation in kidney tubular niches. Conclusions: Spatial transcriptomics reveal novel insights into key differences in the pathophysiology of ICI-AIN versus ICI-ATN. IFN-{gamma}-producing CD8+ T cells are likely key drivers of ICI-AIN and should be investigated as future therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Elevated {beta}2m levels can be detected in various inflammatory, autoimmune, infectious and malignant diseases, often correlating with poor prognosis and reduced survival. So far, no specific functions have been agreed on for soluble {beta}2m. In the present study, we investigated the effects of exogenous {beta}2m and two proteolytically processed forms, cK58{beta}2m and dK58{beta}2m, on ROS production in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). {beta}2m was shown to enhance ROS generation triggered by latex beads, while cK58{beta}2m and dK58{beta}2m suppressed both baseline ROS levels and responses to latex beads, TNF-, and fMLF. Among these, dK58{beta}2m was generally the most potent inhibitor. The inhibitory effect of cK58{beta}2m and dK58{beta}2m was also confirmed in DMSO-differentiated HL-60 cells, a neutrophil-like cell line. Furthermore, treatment with dK58{beta}2m impaired the recruitment of p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane following fMLF stimulation, two key subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex responsible for superoxide anion production in neutrophils. This may explain the reduced ROS production observed in cells treated with dK58{beta}2m.

Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), small vesicular structures secreted by Gram-negative bacteria, are known to contribute to their pathogenicity. This study investigated the role of Fn OMVs in oral cancer progression and the underlying mechanisms. Methods: Metagenomic sequencing was conducted on both oral cancer and control tissues. OMVs were isolated through ultracentrifugation. Cell proliferation assays on two cancer cell lines assessed the impact of Fn and its OMVs. Fn OMVs were administered to mice to evaluate their influence on tumorigenesis. RNA-seq was performed on OMV-treated cells to identify enriched genes, which were validated via qPCR and Western blot. Knockdown experiments were executed in vitro and in vivo to confirm the involvement of Fn OMVs in TNFR1-mediated NF-{kappa}B signaling. Results: Fn prevalence was markedly higher in oral cancer tissues compared to non-cancerous samples. In vitro, Fn and its OMVs significantly enhanced the growth and proliferation of oral cancer cell lines. Mice treated with Fn OMVs developed larger tumors than those receiving Fn alone. Furthermore, Fn OMVs notably induced TNFR1 expression and activated the NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway, as confirmed by RNA-seq, qPCR, and Western blot. TNFR1 knockdown significantly diminished the effects of Fn OMVs on cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Conclusion: This study compellingly demonstrates that Fn OMVs are pivotal in OSCC progression by directly activating TNFR1-mediated NF-{kappa}B signaling.

Here, we investigate the roles of the transcription factors HLH-30/TFEB and DAF-16/FOXO during L1 arrest. We show that HLH-30 and DAF-16 collaborate to ensure survival under starvation, with reciprocal regulation of their subcellular localization and transcriptional activity. HLH-30 exerts broad transcriptional control during L1 arrest, modulating genes involved in chromosome organization and cell cycle progression. Profiling of chromatin spatial distribution reveals that HLH-30 is required for fasting-induced 3D chromatin reorganization. Loss of HLH-30 disrupts seam cell cycle arrest and leads to overactivation of the pioneer transcription factor BLMP-1, leading to premature initiation of developmental programs under starvation. Our findings uncover previously unrecognized functions of HLH-30 in genome architecture and quiescence regulation, highlighting conserved mechanisms of transcriptional control during nutrient deprivation with implications for aging and disease.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

It is often the case that more productive regions support higher herbivore numbers. Yet whether this results in greater herbivore pressure and stronger plant defenses in these populations compared to populations inhabiting less productive regions is uncertain. Here we quantified defense traits and herbivory of Solanum carolinense L. across a large productivity gradient that spans its entire north-south range (29-44 N), using both field observations (33 populations; ~14 plants per population) and a common garden experiment (15 populations; ~4 plants per population). We examined the effects of productivity on 1) plant defense traits (specific leaf area, trichome density and glycoalkaloid concentration), 2) herbivory, and 3) the correlation among traits and herbivory in field and common garden plants. Trichome density and herbivory were higher for S. carolinense at the center of its range, while glycoalkaloid concentrations were negatively associated with productivity both in the field and in the common garden. In the field, plants with higher glycoalkaloid production experienced reduced herbivory, but there was no association with plant defense traits and herbivory in the common garden. Overall, these findings suggest that different types of defensive traits within a single species may follow different ecological and evolutionary trends and highlight the need for trait-specific considerations when applying plant defense hypotheses at the intraspecific level.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

These striking examples of phenotypic plasticity are taxonomically widespread and ecologically important. However, cannibalism is a frequent repercussion of resource polyphenisms. Despite some benefits, cannibalism is always costly to victims and sometimes costly to the cannibal. Therefore, we here evaluate how morphological and behavioral plastic strategies to minimize these costs may evolve. To better understand the evolution and consequences of cannibalistic polyphenisms, we tested whether rotifers Asplanchna brightwellii possess effective morphological defenses against cannibalism and the ability to discriminate by genetic relationship. We found that small humps produced by vulnerable A. brightwellii limit cannibalism. We also found that cannibals were less likely to attack clonemates than non-kin. The rotifer genus Asplanchna comprises species with varying degrees of resource polyphenism, cannibalism, induced morphological defenses, and behavioral kin discrimination. The observed induced defense and kin discrimination in Asplanchna brightwellii likely represent evolutionary intermediates facilitating the evolution of a unique trimorphic resource polyphenism in congeners.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Over a decade ago, it was the first polychaete to have its genome sequenced and assembled, contributing to pioneering studies that transformed our understanding of animal genomes and their evolution. However, this early resource is now outdated compared to current genome sequencing standards, limiting the use of modern functional genomic tools that could further our understanding of numerous biological processes. Results We combine long-read and short-read sequencing with Hi-C chromatin conformation capture data to assemble the chromosome-level nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of the laboratory strain of C. teleta. This reference assembly more accurately reflects the expected genome size for this polychaete (~243.6 Mb) and contains a highly complete, evolutionarily conserved gene repertoire. Notably, the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are heavily rearranged, indicating a decoupling between gene family repertoire and chromosomal evolution. The analyses of multi-omic datasets available for C. teleta, including developmental time courses of bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and EM-seq, using the new reference assembly, resulted in a significant quality improvement, allowing us to identify new cell-type-specific gene markers and gain additional insights of biological relevance. Finally, we generated a publicly available genome browser that ensures all these resources are easily findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Conclusions Our study provides state-of-the-art genomic resources for the polychaete model C. teleta, addressing a pressing community need that will open new research opportunities in animal and genome evolution.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Protein-based biologic therapies, particularly antibody-like therapeutics, have emerged as a major modality to treat nearly all chronic and infectious diseases. Antagonists have dominated the first wave of antibody and antibody-like biologics, whereas agonism has generally been challenging due to systemic activation leading to issues with therapeutic index and problems with pleiotropic activity. Additionally, agonists that use native proteins such as cytokines can be challenging to produce at scale given these proteins evolved to act locally and are not designed for large scale manufacturing. To address these challenges, we generated a biologics platform comprised of stabilized human VH domains (VH-SelectTM) which encompass the entire human germline repertoire with the goal of building multispecific biologics denoted TentaclesTM that use avidity-based binding to achieve conditional activity directed to specific cell types or tissues. Stabilizing disulfides and point mutations were identified computationally with Rosetta, evaluated in vitro, and combined into designs with 3-5 amino acid substitutions for each of the seven germline families (VH1-VH7). Computational design was also employed to reduce dimerization from both VL and homotypic VH-VH interactions. Optimization of specific sequences improved expression by greater than 600-fold and thermostability by more than 20 degreesC. Each of the germline variants were screened for low HLA class II binding and incorporated into a library which demonstrated significant improvements in cellular protein production, thereby increasing sequence diversity for screening campaigns. These VH-SelectTM scaffolds are useful for the discovery of novel binders used to build multispecific TentaclesTM designed for cis-interactions that achieve cell- and tissue-specific activation. As an example of the utility of the platform, we generated a set of TentaclesTM that use VH-SelectTM binders to conditionally agonize IL2Rgamma/beta and 41BB on PD1+, LAG3+, or CD8+ T cells. These Tentacles demonstrate promising manufacturability, antibody-like exposure in vivo, and strong anti-tumor activity in a humanized tumor model. Overall, we believe the incorporation of VH-SelectTM binders into multispecific TentaclesTM has the potential to create a host of conditionally active biologics to treat various chronic and acute diseases.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Standard analysis workflows require mastering multiple command-line tools, hindering exploratory data analysis and delaying scientific discovery. Results: This work presents NSeqVerify, a new cross-platform, open-source desktop software developed in Java, designed to overcome these barriers. NSeqVerify implements a fully integrated genomic workflow within a single, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). The suite includes: (1) a preprocessing module for quality control and filtering of FASTQ files; (2) a de novo assembler employing a sophisticated De Bruijn graph algorithm with an iterative multi-k-mer strategy to maximize contiguity; and (3) a taxonomic assignment module that automates BLAST searches against NCBI databases and displays the results in an easily interpretable tabular format. The tool was validated through controlled use cases, demonstrating its ability to accurately reconstruct reference viral genomes (HIV-1) and to deconvolute metagenomic mixtures (HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2). The final test consisted of analyzing a real elephant fecal virome (SRA: SRR35776009), where NSeqVerify successfully assembled contigs two of which overlapped and appeared to form a partial 1555 bp genome of a putative Smacovirus, enabling the identification of its capsid protein and the prediction of its 3D structure using AlphaFold.

N.; Campbell, K. S.; Ting, L. H.; De Groote, F.", "abstract": "Musculoskeletal simulations can offer valuable insight into how the properties of our musculoskeletal system influence the biomechanics of our daily movements. One such property is muscle's history-dependent initial resistance to stretch, also known as short-range stiffness, which is key to stabilizing movements in response to external perturbations. Short-range stiffness is poorly captured by existing musculoskeletal simulations since they employ phenomenological Hill-type muscle models that lack the mechanisms underlying short-range stiffness. While it has been previously shown that biophysical cross-bridge models can reproduce muscle short-range-stiffness, it is unclear which specific biophysical properties are necessary to capture history-dependent muscle force responses in behaviorally relevant conditions. Here, we tested the ability of various biophysical cross-bridge models to reproduce empirical short-range stiffness and its history-dependent changes across a broad range of behaviorally relevant length changes and activation levels, using an existing dataset on permeabilized rat soleus muscle fibers (N = 11). We found that a biophysical cross-bridge model with cooperative myofilament activation reproduced the effects of muscle activation (R-squared = 0.86), stretch amplitude (R-squared = 0.71) and isometric recovery time (R-squared = 0.79) on history-dependent changes in short-range stiffness after shortening. Similar results were obtained when the cross-bridge distribution of the biophysical model was approximated by a Gaussian (R-squared = 0.73 - 0.88), but at a 20 times lower computational cost. These effects could not be reproduced by either a biophysical cross-bridge model without cooperative myofilament activation or a Hill-type model (R-squared < 0.5). The reduced computational demand of the Gaussian-approximated models facilitates implementing biophysical cross-bridge models with cooperative myofilament activation in musculoskeletal simulations to improve the prediction of short-range stiffness during movements.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Advances in neuroimaging analysis have improved the ability to link cognition with brain function, providing a foundation for developing methods that capture brain dynamics for quantitating emergent cognitive properties during task-based fMRI paradigms. Probabilistic Cognitive State Modeling (PCSM) combines Finite Impulse Response (FIR) modeling of BOLD activity with a Gaussian Mixture Model-Hidden Markov Model (GMM-HMM) to quantify dynamic, spatially distributed brain states. From these posteriors, PCSM derives interpretable, emergent properties including serial-parallel processing, cognitive demand, resource level, and serial bottleneck. A ground-truth simulation evaluated PCSM across systematically varied noise and transition probabilities. Results show that PCSM accurately recovers ground-truth latent states (> 98 %) and produces stable parameter estimates across conditions. Threshold analyses identify reliable boundaries between parallel, mixed, and serial processing modes and recover expected relations among demand, resource availability, and bottleneck persistence.

Here, we present an explicit covering-number analysis of SNNs, focusing on the non-leaky integrate-and fire (nLIF) model. Building on recent advances in causal-piece analysis and local Lipschitz continuity, we derive a global Lipschitz constant for nLIF networks and extend this framework from single-token inputs to full sequences. Our analysis reveals that the sample complexity of nLIF architectures grows quadratically with sequence length, in contrast to the linear or logarithmic scaling observed in recurrent and Transformer models. These findings expose a fundamental architectural limitation in SNNs and suggest targeted architectural and biological modifications needed to overcome it.

P.; Brown, K.; Unsworth, J. R.; Berkowitz, N.; Ruhland, M.

Migratory and lymph node resident conventional dendritic cell subsets occupy distinct anatomical niches and have been shown to shape T cell activation in a variety of immunologic contexts including infection, vaccination and cancer. How peripheral tissue context and dendritic cell subset specific transcriptional programs collaborate to determine CD8+ T cell priming remains incompletely defined. Using fluorescent antigen, we tracked antigen distribution, dendritic cell transcriptional programming, and functional cross-presentation across tumor, inflammatory, and steady state tissue contexts. We find that skin tumor antigen is more widely distributed amongst draining lymph node conventional dendritic cells than skin antigen derived from either steady state or inflamed skin tissue. Comparing across dendritic cell subsets, migratory type 1 dendritic cells display higher expression of MHCI antigen presentation machinery and genes associated with cross-presentation compared with lymph node resident type 1 dendritic cells in tumor and inflamed tissue contexts. Similarly, they exhibited superior per-cell cross-presentation and stronger induction of naive CD8+ T cell responses. We find that both antigen access in the lymph node and cell-intrinsic cross-presentation efficiency together predict the magnitude and quality of CD8+ T cell priming regardless of tissue context. These results identify migratory dendritic cells, particularly type 1, as central mediators of antitumor CD8+ T cell responses and support therapeutic strategies that either restrict antigen dispersal from migratory dendritic cells or augment the efficiency of resident dendritic cell cross-presentation.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Rhesus are a matriarchal, matrilineal species that form hierarchical social hierarchies maintained by aggression. Thus, animals in the bottom of the hierarchy (low social status: subordinate) experience high levels of aggression from those in higher social ranks and therefore must remain vigilant. Social subordination generates chronic psychosocial stress and could negatively impact reproductive function. Twenty-seven adult female rhesus monkeys (13 dominant -DOM-, 14 subordinate -SUB-; 8-11 years old) were studied for stress neuroendocrine function -measuring basal plasma levels of cortisol-, as well as for reproductive endocrine function -measuring basal levels of estradiol (E2). In addition, we examined the reproductive success rates of these females (defined as number of live births/years with male access), their success rates raising infants that survived to 1 year, and the characteristics and effectiveness of their maternal care. Our findings show significantly lower reproductive success rates in SUB than DOM females, blunted E2 seasonal changes, driven by higher E2 levels in the anovulatory season and more attentive maternal care of offspring early in life than dominant females. Age at first birth was negatively associated with infant survival rate across ranks. Interestingly, higher levels of reproductive hormones (E2) during the anovulatory season predicted lower reproductive success, although the effect was driven by animals lactating at that point. Overall, these findings suggest that subordinate female macaques show a phenotype consistent with impaired reproductive function.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Employing whole-body single-cell RNA sequencing, we chart the cellular composition and transcriptional dynamics of larval, metamorphosis, and adult stages. Our tissue level atlas reveals that ectodermal and endodermal cell types in larvae and adults occupy distinct transcriptional spaces, showing greater similarity to other cell types within the same life stage than to their counterparts in the opposite stage. In contrast, mesodermal cell types from both larvae and adults cluster closely together, indicating conserved transcriptional profiles.

We demonstrate that genetic and genomic alterations in rete ovarii epithelial cells (ROECs) can drive their malignant transformation, giving rise to tumors that closely recapitulate the histologic and molecular characteristics of human HGSC. Spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomic analyses of tumors derived from Brca/Trp53/Pten-deficient ROECs (BTP-RO) reveal distinct invasive and immunosuppressive molecular programs. These findings establish ROECs as a previously unrecognized cell of origin for HGSC, expanding the landscape of potential precursor populations beyond the Fallopian tube. The RO-based HGSC model provides a powerful framework for developing origin-informed prevention strategies, early detection approaches, and targeted therapeutics.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

We assessed model performance under zero-shot, continual training, and fine-tuning conditions, conducting 1,170 supervised and 130 unsupervised experiments. Our findings revealed that while current scFMs excel in certain analysis tasks, such as tumor microenvironment cell annotation, they had limited advantages in predicting clinical and biological outcomes of cancer patients compared to simpler baseline models. These insights highlight the critical role of evaluation on biologically and clinically relevant tasks in the responsible and impactful application of scFMs in precision oncology.

Inefficacy of chemical control methods leaves deployment of host resistance to be the only option to manage this disease. However, current commercial varieties are mainly susceptible to BLS. Therefore, our goal was to identify sources of resistance from diverse barley germplasms and map associated genetic factors. To do so, we evaluated a subset of the World Barley Core Collection (BCC), consisting of 198 accessions, on their reaction to BLS from 2013 to 2016 under natural or artificially inoculated disease pressures. Ten accessions exhibited consistently low disease severities over four years of evaluations. Using genotype data from the T3/Barley database, genome-wide association studies were conducted to identify marker-trait associations (MTAs) in this barley mini-core panel for BLS resistance. Utilizing four mixed-model analyses (MLM, MLMM, FarmCPU, BLINK), five significant MTAs were consistently identified from at least two mixed model analyses including two in chromosome 2H, and one each in chromosomes 5H, and 7H. Associations in chromosomes 2H and 5H appear to be in the same region with loci identified in a previous association study, reinforcing their potential relevance.

J.", "abstract": "Accurate discrimination of magnitudes, such as object size and quantity, is crucial for effective action selection and decision-making. A fundamental principle in magnitude discrimination is that discriminability is determined by the ratio of the stimulus values being compared, as formalized by Weber-Fechner's law. Here, we show evidence that the discriminability of numerosity is not as robust as previously thought; rather, it is influenced by task-irrelevant environmental statistics. We measured discrimination thresholds in 24 participants performing a numerosity discrimination task in which pairs of dot arrays were presented either simultaneously or sequentially. Stimulus values were sampled from either narrow or wide ranges. Our findings revealed that, although the magnitude pairs were identical, discrimination performance was significantly better (i.e., lower threshold) when stimulus values were sampled from a narrow-range compared to a wide-range. Strikingly, this improvement was observed only when the stimuli were presented sequentially. A similar pattern emerged in a size discrimination task with analogous manipulations. A control experiment ruled out potential confounding variables related to stimulus variety, emphasizing the importance of the stimulus range in gaining this benefit. Together, these findings suggest that perceptual variability is flexibly scaled according to context, particularly when the representations are less reliable. Our study highlights the adaptive nature of stimulus encoding strategies, whereby the brain minimizes representational uncertainty by dynamically leveraging contextual information.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Stimulus-specific response potentiation (SSRP) is a non-invasive form of cortical neuroplasticity that can be induced through repeated presentation of high-contrast visual stimuli. Classically, SSRP, like long-term potentiation and related plasticity mechanisms, has been hypothesized to demonstrate input specificity, such that potentiation is confined to the neural populations and synapses driven by the induction stimulus. In addition, SSRP is observed to accumulate across days in rodent models. Despite growing interest in this phenomenon, it remains unclear whether factors such as selective attention influence the magnitude or specificity of a potentiated response. This study investigated whether covert endogenous attention could modulate the strength of SSRP in high-density EEG recordings from neurotypical human participants. An established SSRP paradigm was modified to include an attention task during induction. Pre-post response amplitudes were measured with frequency-tagged (6 and 7.5 reversals-per-second) bilateral hemifield contrast-sweep checkerboard steady-state visual-evoked potential stimuli. The 10-minute high-contrast 2 Hz sign-reversing SSRP induction stimulus was presented only in the left hemifield, with the right hemifield serving as a control. On two different experimental days, each participant deployed attention either toward or away from the potentiated hemifield during induction. Response amplitudes increased after SSRP, with increases in response amplitude manifesting in both the potentiated and control non-potentiated hemifields, weighing against the idea that SSRP is input-specific. Interestingly, significantly more response potentiation observed on the second session day compared to the first, independent of attention condition. Finally, we observed that attention enhanced SSRP in naive but not experienced observers (i.e. on Session-Day 1 but not Session-Day 2), identifying a significant interaction between attention condition and session day. Overall our results suggest that (1) SSRP in humans may not in fact be stimulus-specific (potentiation effects are not input- or retinotopically- specific), (2) visual spatial attention has a modest enhancing effect on SSRP in first-session participants, and (3) a second session of SSRP leads to a pronounced plasticity effect compared to the first session that occludes any attentional modulation.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Upon stimulation, the FRC-conduit network responds dynamically to accommodate the massive expansion of immune cells in the LN. However, there is still a limited understanding of how niche-associated FRC subsets and the conduit network are remodeled and whether this remodeling affects host immune protection. In an oxazolone (OX)-induced skin inflammation model, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to characterize alterations in FRC subsets and identified a new subset expressing an intermediate level of CXCL13 (Cxcl13int RCs) in the inflamed LN. Further studies revealed that Cxcl13int RCs replaced Ccl19lo FRCs in the interfollicular zones (IFZs) of the inflamed LN, leading to a compromised conduit network. The induction of Cxcl13int RCs depended on B cell-derived lymphotoxin signaling. Notably, depleting B cells preserved the integrity and function of the conduit network in the inflamed LNs. On the other hand, lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) primarily expanded in the medullary sinus and were independent of B cells. Moreover, the remodeling of the FRC-conduit network weakened the neutrophil response to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection in the inflamed LN, whereas restoring the FRC-conduit network rescued the immune protection. This study provided a mechanism by which the FRC-conduit network is remodeled and skin inflammation weakens host immunity to secondary infections.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

To investigate this hypothesis, we compared the peripheral TCR repertoire within T-cell subsets in twin pairs, concordant and discordant for Crohn's disease. Methods: We performed TCR and TCR{beta} sequencing on peripheral flow-sorted CD4+ memory gut-homing (integrin4{beta}7+), non-gut-homing (integrin4{beta}7-), and regulatory T-cells (Tregs) from Dutch monozygotic Crohn's disease concordant twins (N=8), monozygotic Crohn's disease discordant twins (N=8), and healthy controls (N=4). TCR diversity and clonality, overlap between individuals, convergence and enrichment, and clustering of the TCR repertoire was studied and compared to previously reported Crohn's disease-related TCRs. Results: Overall diversity and clonality was comparable between Crohn's disease patients, healthy cotwins and healthy controls. Comparing T-cell subsets, a decreased diversity and increased clonality was observed for Tregs. Concordant Crohn's disease twins had an increased overlap in TCRs for Tregs and CD4+ memory gut-homing T-cells. Using TCR convergence, enrichment and subsequent clustering analyses, we identified eight clusters of TCRs potentially related with Crohn's disease. The identified Crohn's disease-related TCR signatures have not previously been described in relation to Crohn's disease, and have thus far mostly unknown antigen specificity. Conclusions: Increased overlap in the TCR repertoires of monozygotic twin pairs concordant for Crohn's disease suggest that (antigen-driven) skewing of the TCR repertoire could play a role in the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease. The identified TCR-based Crohn's disease signatures are prime targets for further study into the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

These included: Aulac in the upper Bay of Fundy which was former pastureland on its 12th and 13th year of restoration, and Wallace Bay on the Northumberland Strait which was a former freshwater impoundment on its 2nd and 3rd year of restoration. Nekton community structure in creeks and on platforms and pool abiotic conditions and fauna differed between site types (i.e., restoring and reference established marshes) in both case studies. Prey composition of tomcods (Microgadus tomcod) and mummichogs (Fundulus heteroclitus) also differed between fish caught in restoring and reference sites, yet site type variations in gut fullness were only identified in platform mummichog in Wallace Bay.

Although invasive range-expanders threaten native species, lethal management can be challenged based on the notion that range-expanders are native and therefore less likely to precipitate ecological damage. The anthropogenically-mediated range expansion of barred owls (Strix varia) from eastern to western North America exemplifies this controversy: a recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan to cull barred owls for the benefit of spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) ignited public outcry and resistance. Here, we assessed barred owls' potential invasiveness and broader effects on biodiversity by using molecular methods to characterize the diet of 788 individuals in California, Oregon, and Washington. Barred owls consumed 162 vertebrate and invertebrate prey species, including 29 species with federal- or state-level conservation status. Our findings suggest that barred owls may (1) threaten smaller native predators via intraguild predation and competition for shared prey; and (2) further imperil amphibian communities already threatened by a suite of environmental stressors. We thus contend that barred owls function as an invasive species in their expanded range. The Precautionary Principle suggests that large-scale lethal management is warranted to curb barred owls' impacts on not just spotted owls but broader ecological communities in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. More broadly, our study highlights the significant biodiversity loss that could result from range expansions of a generalist predator and provides a roadmap for quantifying putative impacts.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Results: Using comparative genomics between human and rodent coding sequences, we uncovered a conserved codon-bias axis. A/T-ending codons consistently marked genes involved in proliferation and RNA processing, whereas G/C-ending codons were enriched for differentiation and neuronal functions. While GC3 scores, measuring the third-nucleotide codon bias, showed differences between humans and rodents due to recombination events, the functional dichotomy was conserved. Isoacceptors frequencies, measuring gene synonymous codon bias, was conserved from rodents to humans. Synonymous codons exhibited distinct functional enrichment patterns, demonstrating functional divergence at the codon level. Two new indices; the ANN-index and m7G-index, reflecting codons decoded by the t6A and m7G tRNA modifications, linked tRNA modification biology to translation. Both indices correlated with proliferative, A/T-biased programs, providing a universal basis for their roles in cancer. Tissue proteomes showed strong RNA-protein discordance and distinct codon biases. Analysis of 21 cancer types revealed a global A/T-ending codon bias in cancer. Analysis of 2,600 cancer cell lines revealed codon bias heterogeneity in cell lines from the same cancer subtype that is not observable between cancer patients.

While the circadian phase has been measured using dim light melatonin onset (DLMO), the gold standard marker, its high cost and time-intensive nature have led to the development of alternative estimation methods. Among these, the most promising method is using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models, which simulate the circadian rhythm by using a light exposure profile estimated from sleep data. These ODE models require an initial condition (IC) representing the initial state of the circadian rhythm, which is unknown in real-world settings. However, it is unclear how the uncertainty of IC affects the accuracy of circadian phase estimation. In this study, by using sleep data collected from 28 shift workers using ActiWatch (mean duration = 56 days, range = 34-75 days), we found that [&ge;]18 days of sleep data are required for the circadian phase to become independent of the subjective IC choice. The result showed that without an accurate IC, circadian phase estimation is dependent on subjective IC choice, meaning that circadian phase estimates in the first 17 days are not reliable. Indeed, these days were reduced to 13 - 15 days on average when previous studies' IC estimation methods were used. To further shorten this length, we developed new IC estimation methods--period- and work history-based sleep methods--that incorporate daily variations in sleep history. Notably, the new methods reduced the number of days required for reliable circadian phase estimation to about seven days. Hence, our approach allows a larger portion of circadian phase estimates from given sleep data to be used as reliable information. The superiority of our methods paves the way for improved circadian phase estimation, ultimately enhancing the practicality of chronotherapy applications.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

We developed TimeFlow 2, a new method for lineage inference in large flow cytometry datasets. It uses a single static snapshot of unordered cells and does not require prior knowledge of the number of pathways, cell type or temporal labels. TimeFlow 2 uses the cell orderings from TimeFlow and defines coarse cell states along pseudotime segments. By connecting these states, it constructs paths at cell state level. To approximate the trajectory structure, it further groups the paths based on an Optimal Transport-based cost function. We used TimeFlow 2 on three healthy bone marrow samples and accurately assigned monocytes, neutrophils, erythrocytes and B-cells of different maturation stages to four distinct pathways. Marker dynamics across the inferred pathways showed highly correlated patterns for the corresponding lineages in all three patients. We compared the performance of TimeFlow 2 and three other established methods using standard classification and correlation metrics. TimeFlow 2 outperformed the others on flow cytometry datasets and remained competitive on the challenging mass cytometry datasets. Overall, TimeFlow 2 detects biologically informative pathways, allowing bioinformaticians to model and compare marker dynamics across cell lineages in a data-driven way.

M.; Sarkar, P.; Ahuja, S.", "abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease involving dynamic interactions between cancer, stromal, and infiltrating immune cells, as well as between these cells and the extracellular matrix components of the tumor microenvironment. Brain metastases arise primarily from solid tumors and often result in fatal outcomes. An in-depth understanding of the complex intercellular interactions that evolve in the brain microenvironment is essential to enabling early cancer diagnostics and improving patient outcomes. The protected tumor microenvironment of the brain hinders, however, direct access, impeding the execution of mechanistic studies and limiting the ability to derive meaningful insights. Several in vitro 2D and 3D model systems have been developed to circumvent this problem, none, however, without limitations. The 2D models fail to recapitulate the 3D architecture of the in-vivo environment lacking therefore physiological relevance, while the 3D models present challenges related to the lack of control over cell positioning, lack of vascularization, contamination from non-human scaffolds, batch-to-batch reproducibility, and high production costs. To overcome some of these limitations, we developed an in vitro scaffold-free 3D tumor model system to simulate the in vivo brain metastatic niche. The model was constructed from human brain endothelial cells (HBEC-5i) and two different cancer cell lines derived from breast (MDA-MB-231/triple negative and SK-BR-3/HER2+) and aggressive ovarian (SK-OV-3) cancers. The development of the model relies on a newly identified affinity between the endothelial and cancer cells that enables them to self-assemble in 3D networked constructs, a feature facilitated by the high collagen production by endothelial cells and the secretion of key chemokines by both endothelial and cancer cells. The model mimics the attachment of metastasized cancer cells to the brain microvasculature, enabling the study of temporal changes in endothelial morphology and molecular signaling processes that sustain cancer cell migration, survival, proliferation, and angiogenic processes. Moreover, the model exhibits long-term stability, reproducibility, and effectiveness in evaluating anti-cancer agents. Altogether, the scaffold-free, simple 3D in vitro model systems provides a low cost, physiologically relevant tool for studying the dynamic molecular crosstalk between cancer and brain endothelial cells, and for investigating the fundamental biological processes that unfold in the tumor microenvironment.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

The locus coeruleus (LC) is among the first brain regions to show degeneration and Tau pathology during the early stages of AD. Previous studies have demonstrated that short-term chemogenetic LC stimulation can improve memory performance in the TgF344-AD rat model, while long-term norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibition can worsen memory deficits in the ADLPTau mouse model. However, the effects of long-term LC stimulation in Tau mouse models on memory, synaptic plasticity, and tauopathy remain unclear. Objective: To evaluate the impact of long-term locus coeruleus stimulation on memory, synaptic plasticity, and tauopathy in PS19 mice using behavioral paradigms, electrophysiological recordings, and immunohistochemical analysis. Methods: The radial arm water maze and fear conditioning test were conducted to assess memory performance in PS19 mice with and without long-term LC stimulation. Hippocampal long-term potentiation was recorded to evaluate the effect of long-term LC stimulation on synaptic plasticity. Immunohistochemistry was employed to examine Tau phosphorylation, neurodegeneration, and neuroinflammation. Results: Long-term LC stimulation in PS19 mice exacerbated spatial memory deficits in the water maze, impaired contextual fear memory, reduced hippocampal LTP, and increased AEP expression, Tau hyperphosphorylation, and astrocyte activation. Conclusion: Long-term LC stimulation may exacerbate memory deficits in PS19 mice by impairing synaptic plasticity and increasing neural degeneration in the hippocampus. Elevated norepinephrine levels resulting from long-term LC stimulation may increase AEP expression, contributing to Tau hyperphosphorylation in the LC.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Since 2021, a virulent strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b) has caused unprecedented mortality in wild birds across continents. Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus) are among the species that suffered significant population declines in Europe and North America. At North America's largest gannet colony (Bonaventure Island) dramatic mortality and reproductive failure occurred in 2022. Following this event, researchers noted a subset of gannets displaying irregular iris pigmentation, raising the possibility that this visible change may indicate a lasting effect of infection. Here, we build on earlier observations linking irregular iris pigmentation to HPAIV exposure in gannets using anti-nucleoprotein (NP) and anti-hemagglutinin (H5) antibodies. This provides the first quantitative test of this relationship using serological data and field-based digital photography. Iris irregularities were strongly associated ( {rho} = -0.72) with antibodies to NP, supporting the hypothesis that they can indicate past exposure. The likelihood of NP antibody detection increased with iris pigment irregularity - about 50% likelihood at 40% irregularity, 65% at 50%, 77% at 60%, and over 90% above 77% irregularity. Moderate correlations ({rho} = 0.30) were observed for H5 antibodies. Our findings provide quantitative support for the hypothesis that iris pigmentation irregularities may serve as a visible, non-invasive marker of past HPAIV exposure in gannets. If validated across colonies and years, iris assessment could offer a rapid tool for tracking population health and recovery following HPAIV outbreaks, enhancing conservation monitoring and disease surveillance.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

In this study, a C26 colon cancer mouse model was used to examine how tumor burden alters BCAA metabolism across skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, and adipose tissue. Tumors accumulated BCAA and showed increased oxidation of these amino acids, whereas peripheral sites displayed widespread BCAA depletion, reduced expression of the amino acid (AA) transporter LAT1, and suppression of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling. Notably, the soleus muscle maintained mTORC1 activity despite reduced BCAA availability, suggesting fiber type specific adaptations. These findings indicate that tumors act as metabolic sinks, diverting systemic AA away from host tissues.

Furthermore, to use this model to evaluate effects of age, sex and sleep architecture on overnight heart rate variability (HRV) in healthy subjects. From a polysomnography database, 215 whole-night, high quality electrocardiograms (ECGs) were extracted. The fractal and oscillatory power-spectral densities (PSDs) were calculated from evenly resampled RR-interval time-series, then a broken power-law model was fitted using piecewise linear regression to the double-logarithmic PSD, determining a custom breaking point in the fractal component, and allowing for two independent spectral slopes in the lower and higher frequency domains. The two-slope model provided a more optimal description compared to linear regression in all cases, even when penalizing increased model complexity. Peak detection was applied to the oscillatory component in the LF (0.04-0.15 Hz) and HF (0.15-0.4 Hz) bands, extracting the frequency and prominence of the dominant peak from each. The high frequency domain intercept, the breaking point frequency and the LF peak frequency decreased significantly with age. Both slopes were flatter in females, while the high domain intercept and the HF peak prominence was significantly increased. Waking after sleep onset and lightest sleep (N1) were associated with lower intercept values, while REM sleep had an opposite effect. The broken power-law model proved to be more appropriate for the description of RR-interval spectra than the single-slope model, and also captured effects of age, sex and sleep structure that were corroborated by the literature.

In simulations of plant meristems subject to selection and mutation bias, only extremely strong dominant mutations produced gene-body patterns in the same direction as empirical estimates of hypomutation. However, after accounting for this selection, we can recover the true underlying mutation rate variation. We apply this to re-analysis of Arabidopsis mutation-accumulation datasets. After selection, we see ~50% lower mutation rates in gene bodies and an additional ~15-30% reduction in broadly expressed genes, consistent with mutation rate bias. This framework provides a quantitative method to compare mutation rates across the genome while explicitly controlling for selection on coding sequence mutations.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

These genomes represent potential targets for modification in crop breeding. Due to their presence in hundreds of copies per cell and their non-Mendelian inheritance, these genomes have remained difficult to modify, hindering both fundamental studies and applied utilization compared to nuclear genomes. Recently, targeted single-base editing (C-to-T and A-to-G) of organelle genomes has become feasible and efficiently worked in multiple species. However, information on useful mutations applicable to the generation of desirable crop variants or elite cultivars remains scarce. Here, we sought to establish a forward genetics approach specialized for C-to-T substitutions by developing a method to introduce random C-to-T mutations across entire target organelle genomes. We engineered a fusion protein, designated WHY2-CD mutator, by linking a cytidine deaminase (CD), uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI), and a sequence-nonspecific DNA-binding protein WHIRLY2 (WHY2), to a plastid- or mitochondrion-targeting transit peptide. This construct introduced C-to-T substitutions at broadly distributed positions specifically within the target organelle genome. In the T2 generation, we identified plastid genome mutants carrying homoplasmic (homozygous) substitutions at distinct positions among individuals, including a rpoA knockout line and rbcL variants with an amino acid substitution. Furthermore, screening T3 populations on spectinomycin (spm) enabled the isolation of plastid genome mutants with spm-resistant phenotypes, and subsequent identification of the underlying mutations. These mutations can potentially be transferred to other plants and crops, and beneficial alleles can be stacked using a targeted base editor, transcription activator-like effector cytidine deaminase (TALECD).

We detected seeded tau P301L--eGFP aggregation within late endosomes/lysosomes of iNs but not in undifferentiated iPSCs. Colocalization with a Dextran pH biosensor showed that the aggregates remained within the lumen of an intact, low-pH compartment. Reporters of endolysosomal injury and repair (endolysosomal recruitment cytosolic galectin-3 and the ESCRT-III component IST1) did not change during seeding. Volume focused-ion-beam scanning electron microscopy showed fibrillar material exclusively inside membrane-bounded endolysosomes, with no membrane discontinuities in the fibril-containing compartments and with no evidence of cytosolic aggregates.

Pharmacologic inhibition of the endolysosomal lipid kinase PIKfyve with apilimod suppressed seeded tau aggregation and prevented neuronal toxicity. These data indicate that templated conversion proceeds within acidic, membrane-intact endolysosomes; tau seeding in neurons is enabled by transient, self-limited endolysosomal perforations yet remains confined to the endolysosomal lumen, and it requires PIKfyve-dependent PI(3,5)P2.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

However, poor sleep quality is prevalent, reportedly affecting approximately 38% of the adult population. Poor sleep quality is a significant risk factor for mood disorders, a predictive factor in cognitive decline in later life, and sleep disturbance is a putative precursor to severe cognitive impairment and is predictive of dementia onset. The direct relationship between these factors and intrinsic neural function is poorly understood. Integrating neurophysiology, cognition, and sleep quality to reveal latent factors would help understand the neurophysiology of sleep disturbances and their relation to cognitive performance. Here, we used data from the Cam-CAN dataset with a partial least squares (PLS) approach, producing a multivariate cross-decomposition model to map resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data and cognitive/sleep scores of healthy controls (n = 490, age 18-86). Normative modelling was applied to MEG data, correcting for effects of age, sex, and handedness. We identify a significant relationship between poorer self-reported sleep quality and lower cognitive performance across multiple domains, characterised by excess low-frequency neural activity and reduced high-frequency activity, particularly in the alpha band. Moreover, globally increased low frequency and decreased alpha-beta functional connectivity, the dominant frequency channel in neural connectivity at rest across the brain, contribute significantly to this relationship. Our multivariate mapping approach enabled us to parse the electrophysiological signatures directly related to sleep quality and cognitive performance, independent of the confounding effects of age, and show that neural slowing and dysconnectivity are intrinsically linked to self-reported sleep quality and cognitive performance.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Previous studies, however, have primarily focused on two modalities (visual and auditory) and often highlight regions implicated in audiovisual processing (e.g., posterior STS), but do not delineate a compact, replicable subnetwork for multimodal, naturalistic stimuli. While these studies produced valuable maps of sensory integration, their scope was restricted to two modalities and they lacked replication, leaving the full picture of the multimodal integration uncertain.

Q.; Chen, V.; Wang, Y.; Xin, G.; Cui, W.; Silverstein, R. L.", "abstract": "Background: Atherosclerosis is characterized by the buildup of fatty plaques that thicken and stiffen arterial walls. Macrophages (M{varphi}s) significantly contribute to this process through their scavenger receptor CD36. PIM1 is a serine/threonine kinase known to modulate immune responses and cell metabolism. However, its role in M{varphi} lipid handling and atherogenesis is not well defined. This study examines the role of PIM1 in regulating CD36 expression and function in M{varphi}s during foam cell formation and atherosclerosis progression. Methods: We performed in vitro studies by treating murine peritoneal M{varphi}s from Pim1-/- and wild-type (WT) mice with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL). We measured CD36, PIM1, and plaque-associated proteins and mRNA levels, oxLDL binding and uptake rates, as well as foam cell formation. For in vivo studies, we fed M{varphi}-specific PIM1-deficient (Apoe-/-Lyz2Cre/+Pim1fl/fl) and their littermate control (Apoe-/-Pim1fl/fl) mice a high-fat diet for 12 weeks. We then evaluated the plaque formation in their aortic sinuses and arches. Results: Deletion of Pim1 in M{varphi}s reduced CD36 protein expression by up to 96.7% compared to WT controls. This led to a 49.6% decrease in foam cell formation and a 25.5% reduction in cellular cholesterol after oxLDL treatment. Pharmacological inhibition of PIM kinase activity in WT M{varphi}s also impaired oxLDL handling, with a 64.5% reduction in binding and a 57.9% in uptake. Bulk RNA-seq revealed that Pim1 deficiency downregulated PPAR{gamma} signaling. Treatment with a PPAR{gamma} agonist restored CD36 levels in the PIM1 knockdown M{varphi}s, suggesting that PIM1 regulates CD36 through PPAR{gamma}. Moreover, PIM1 M{varphi}-specific deficiency caused a 69.4% reduction in atherosclerotic plaque formation. Conclusion: PIM1 acts as a key upstream regulator of CD36 by enhancing PPAR{gamma} activity in M{varphi}s. The PIM1-CD36 axis promotes oxLDL binding, uptake, and foam cell formation. Targeting the PIM1/PPAR{gamma}/CD36 pathway could offer new ways to modulate M{varphi} lipid metabolism and reduce atherosclerotic plaque progression.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

However, unraveling the effects of multimodal interactions between tumor and immune cells and their contributions to tumor control using an experimental approach alone is time- and resource-intensive. To identify the critical immunological features associated with tumor control and escape, we built a mechanistic mathematical model of the interactions between CD8+ T cells, Tregs, DCs, and tumor cells deeply rooted in current biological concepts. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it captures Treg accrual occurring after checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. After successfully fitting the model to experimental data of a mouse model of immunogenic melanoma, we generated hundreds of parameter sets, each representing a unique virtual mouse, that fit the data equally as well to capture variability across individuals. Our model indicates that the tumor and immune states before therapy are a key limiting factor of the immune response. Increasing the initial number of tumor-killing CD8+ T cells alone does not always result in a better outcome; instead, the model implies that there exist optimal initial ratios of immune cells that will result in improved tumor control. The model further predicts that the Treg influx into the tumor is a key determinant of resistance to PD-1 immunotherapy. We validated this predictions experimentally. Overall, this integrated approach of modeling and experimental validation identified crucial determinants of resistance to immunotherapy and can be used to guide the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Monitoring ecosystem condition requires a suite of ecological indicators that simultaneously capture the complexity and variability of ecological processes, while being informative and usable in management and decision-making contexts.

However, there are few tests linking plasticity to population persistence. Here, we show that plasticity promotes population persistence in replicate populations of rotifers. We experimentally exposed 33 clonal lines that varied in plasticity to over 20 novel environments for up to 40 overlapping generations. We found that clonal populations expressing plasticity in morphology and life history traits persisted longer and were less likely to go extinct in novel environments than populations not expressing such plasticity. These results directly link plasticity to population persistence in novel environments and suggest that plasticity can buy time for organisms in a changing world.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

The existing reference genome is, however, highly fragmented into 47,877 scaffolds, hampering chromosome-scale analyses for these fields. Here, we report a high-quality, chromosome-scale genome assembly for the white-eyed mutant strain of this cricket, generated using a combination of Nanopore and PacBio HiFi long reads, integrated with Hi-C data. The final 1.62 Gbp assembly achieves a scaffold N50 of 107.4 Mbp, a significant improvement in contiguity over the previous 6.3 Mbp N50. We anchored 94.45% of the assembly into 15 pseudomolecules, consistent with the known karyotype (n = 15). The genome completeness (BUSCO v6.0.0 insecta_odb12) reached 98.1%. We also updated the annotation, identifying 14,964 protein-coding genes. This gene set shows markedly improved completeness (BUSCO v6.0.0 insecta_odb12: 95.7%) compared with the previous annotation (81.2%) and successfully recovers all nine essential neuropeptide genes previously reported as missing from the draft assembly.

H.; Uauy, C.; Smit, S.; Schranz, M. E.", "abstract": "Motivation: In the era of multiple genome references, researchers often align sequencing reads against distinct assemblies or even multiple references simultaneously. This enables applications such as the detection of introgressed segments or highly variable genomic regions, which are especially prevalent in large-genome crop species such as lettuce or wheat. However, these applications come at the cost of increased computational burden, inconsistencies in mapping methods, and reduced reproducibility across studies. To address these limitations, we developed KCFtools, a Java-based toolkit that identifies the presence and absence of k-mers in non-overlapping genomic or transcriptomic windows by comparing query and reference genomes. This alignment-free approach enables the efficient computation of an identity score for each window, thereby facilitating robust detection of introgressed or variable regions across genomes. Results: We systematically evaluated the performance and accuracy of the k-mer-based method implemented in KCFtools, benchmarking it against conventional SNP-based introgression detection pipelines. Our results demonstrate that KCFtools effectively captures introgressed segments and structurally diverse regions, even in species with fragmented or highly divergent reference genomes. In addition, we extended KCFtools to generate genotype matrices from k-mer variation tables. These matrices are compatible with Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) software and allow the identification of loci associated with phenotypic traits. We showcase the utility of this approach by detecting known and novel associations for downy mildew resistance in lettuce, underscoring the pipeline's potential for high-resolution, reference-agnostic population genetic analysis.

While a stability hierarchy of RNA{middle dot}DNA-DNA > DNA{middle dot}DNA-DNA > RNA{middle dot}RNA-RNA, with no DNA{middle dot}RNA-RNA triplex forming, is known, the kinetic roles of terminal residues remain poorly understood. Here, we employ bio-layer interferometry (BLI) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to demonstrate that dangling ends from both the third strand (triplex-forming oligonucleotide, TFO) and the duplex dramatically enhance triplex stability. Kinetic analysis reveals this stabilization is primarily driven by a marked increase in the association rate (k). Crucially, creating a single-base-pair dangling end at either terminus of the duplex enhanced triplex stability more effectively than blunt ends. For example, DNA TFO dTFO5 binding to d(HP5+TA) was enhanced compared to dHP5, and similarly RNA TFO rTFO5 binding to RNA duplex r(HP5+UA) and DNA duplex d(HP5+TA) showed stronger affinity and faster association than to blunt-ended rHP5 and dHP5. Interestingly, removal of a terminal base pair from the blunt-end duplex, generating a TFO dangling end, also enhances binding affinity and association rate. This indicates that both duplex and TFO dangling ends provide critical nucleation platforms, while blunt-ended terminal triples are dynamic and contribute minimally to stability. Thus, our work establishes that optimal triplex formation requires strategic optimization of both TFO and duplex terminal structures through a fundamental kinetic principle (bimodal nucleation).", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Understanding aSyn's pathological role remains a major challenge due to its complex, context-dependent energy landscape characterized by conformational plasticity and fibril polymorphism. Here, we present a systematic mutational analysis as a quantitative probe of the aSyn energy landscape, focusing on electrostatic contributions to key aggregation pathways. We engineered aSyn variants with one to eight lysine-to-glutamine substitutions and analyzed their aggregation under controlled conditions to delineate their effects on nucleation, elongation, seed amplification, fibril stability, and fibril polymorphism. We find that aSyn aggregation from a homogenous solution can be modelled well using global properties, including protein concentration, charge, and ionic strength. Microscopic pathways and the resulting fibril polymorphs are instead modulated by sequence-specific effects. We identify mutations of residues found in fibril cores as perturbations that significantly modify the aSyn free energy landscape, creating pathways and energy minima not accessible to the WT under the same experimental conditions. In contrast, mutations outside of the fibril core affect the magnitude of the relevant energy barriers whilst overall maintaining a WT-like free energy landscape. Our work outlines a scalable, quantitative framework that increases the informational output of the mutational studies of aSyn using conventional assays. The approach can be extended by incorporating additional mutational and functional data to deepen our understanding of aSyn's energy landscape and its role in health and disease.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

However, the contribution of mesenchymal-like and epithelial TNBC cells in the persistence of chemotherapy resistant disease remains poorly understood. Methods: Mesenchymal-like and epithelial TNBC cell types were detected by multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry using antibodies against vimentin, Ki67, and Annexin A6 (AnxA6). Chemotherapy drug resistant mesenchymal-like and epithelial TNBC cell populations were established by pulse exposure and stepwise dose escalation and validated by 3D cultures and unbiased antibody arrays. Results: Analysis of the response of stage IV TNBC tumors treated with six common chemotherapy regimens resulted in 36% complete response and 64% partial response with residual tumor sizes ranging from 0.5 to 37.0 mm. Treatment of TNBC cells with chemotherapy agents led to distinct resistance signatures including downregulation of survivin and upregulation of M-CSF and CXCL8/IL-8 in model mesenchymal-like, and upregulation of CCL2/MCP-1, CTSS and DKK-1 in model epithelial TNBC cells. The inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3{beta} (p-S9) increased in paclitaxel resistant epithelial cells but decreased in resistant mesenchymal-like TNBC cells. Finally, chemotherapy resistance also activated p90 ribosomal S6 kinases (RSK1/2) in both cell types, while activation of mitogen- and stress-activated kinases (MSK1/2) was only observed in chemotherapy resistant epithelial TNBC cells. Conclusions: These data reveal that chemotherapy resistance of epithelial and mesenchymal-like TNBC cellular subsets upregulated distinct profiles of proinflammatory and immune cell chemotactic cytokines and modulated the activities of GSK-3{beta}, p90 RSK1/2 and the related MSK1/2. Targeting these factors and/or the associated signaling pathways may help overcome chemotherapy resistance in TNBC.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Yet mapping the uptake of primary EV proteomes by human immune cells at single-cell resolution has been constrained by a lack of labeling strategies. We show here that TeLEV, a tellurium-based metabolic mass tagging approach that incorporates L-2-tellurienylalanine (TePhe) into EV proteomes, can produce a biologically rare monoisotopic signal, which is detectable by mass cytometry, imaging mass cytometry, and nanoscale SIMS, without perturbing EV morphology, yield, or proteome composition. We applied TeLEV to label primary malignant B-cell-derived EVs (MBC-EVs) from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and could follow EV uptake by distinct cell populations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MBC-EV uptake occurred predominantly in cells of myeloid lineages. In direct control experiments with matched secreted proteins, a machine learning approach identified CD123, CD127, and CD25 as key markers distinguishing primary MBC-EV recipients from matched secreted protein recipient cells. Nanoscale imaging enabled localization of EV-delivered proteins within heterochromatin, whereas Te-labeled secreted proteins accumulated in the cytoplasm of recipient cells. We then generated a pan-immune EV uptake atlas by tracing the uptake of primary and cell-line EVs from nine cell lines and six donors with chronic lymphocytic leukemia into 2,977,094 recipient cells across 43 cell types and subpopulations. We found that the uptake of MBC-EVs by myeloid recipients induced monocyte-derived dendritic-cell polarization characterized by the co-expression of the interleukin-receptor triad (IL-RT: CD123, CD127, CD25) identified above. Time-resolved EV uptake analysis showed a rapid, transient expression of CD123/CD127 followed by CD25, both tightly coupled to MBC-EV uptake by myeloid cells. The intensity of IL-RT expression correlated with that of PD-L1 and BCL-2. Using different STAT degraders to bidirectionally modify the EV-induced STAT5 signal, we observed that MBC-EV uptake and IL-RT, PD-L1, and BCL-2 expression increased with STAT3 degradation and decreased with STAT5 degradation. To investigate the functional consequences of the MBC-EV-induced changes, we showed that MBC-EVs in the presence of IL-2 induced a high-CD25 immune state with low cytotoxic and high B cell proliferation. Taken together, TeLEV represents a novel tool for single-cell tracking of EV proteomes, revealing STAT5-dependent immune remodeling of recipient cells.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Macrophages residing in TME switch from pro-phagocytic to tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive phenotypes as cancer develops. While these pro-tumor functions of macrophages are associated with poor outcomes, the underlying mechanisms by which bone-marrow (BM)-associated macrophages fuel myeloid malignancy and their precise contribution to relapse remain undissected. Here, we show expansion of monocyte/macrophage population in leukemia patients post-chemotherapy relapse, and spatial proximity of macrophages to leukemia blasts in the BM niche. This proximity proved functionally consequential--depletion of macrophages delayed leukemia relapse post cytarabine (AraC), a frontline chemotherapy, in patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and syngeneic leukemia models. Mechanistically, a pyrimidine metabolite, deoxycytidine (dC), secreted by BM macrophages, is taken up by leukemia cells to directly inhibit deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) to hamper AraC activation and subsequent resistance in a cell non-autonomous manner. Diagnosis AML patients exhibited significantly higher circulating dC levels than healthy donors, and dC levels further increased following chemotherapy. SAMHD1, which catalyzes deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) into deoxynucleoside, was highly abundant in macrophages and mediated dC accumulation. Blockade of dC production in mouse and human macrophages via genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SAMHD1 or DHODH, a critical enzyme in pyrimidine synthesis, restored AraC sensitivity. Combination with DHODH inhibitors significantly delayed AraC relapse in human PDX and mouse syngeneic AML models.

Extracting ECG recordings from a polysomnography database of 20 subjects with WS and 20 age and sex matched typically developing (TD) controls, RR-interval time series were constructed, then the fractal and oscillatory power-spectral densities computed using the Irregular-Resampling Auto-Spectral Analysis (IRASA) method. The fractal component was parametrized with a piecewise-linear function, that allowed for a custom breaking point in the power spectral density (PSD), and separate slope and intercept values in the lower and higher frequency domains. The frequency and prominence of the dominant peak was extracted from the LF (0.04-0.15 Hz) and HF (0.15-0.4 Hz) bands. Strong WS vs TD group differences were found in the frequency of the breaking point, high domain slope, intercept and HF peak prominence. Analysis of the LF peak frequency revealed age-dependent decrease in the TD, but not in the WS group, while generally decreased values in WS independent of age, potentially reflected accelerated aging, characteristic of the syndrome. As fractal parameters were correlated, a main component was identified using principal component analysis that described the typical alterations in the fractal spectrum in WS, and was correlated with sleep structure indices as well. The broken power-law model proved to be successful in characterizing the fractal component of HRV spectra, furthermore it captured alterations in cardiac regulation in WS.

Previous works have used the theory of compressed sensing to elucidate the algorithmic basis for this capability: decoding odor information from the responses of a restricted repertoire of receptors is possible because only a few relevant odorants are present in any given sensory scene. However, existing circuit models for olfactory decoding still cannot contend with the complexity of naturalistic olfactory scenes; they are limited to detection of a handful of odorants. Here, we propose a model for olfactory compressed sensing inspired by simultaneous localization and mapping algorithms in navigation: the set of odors that are present in a given scene, and the concentration of those present odors, are inferred separately. To enable rapid inference of odor presence in a biologically-plausible recurrent circuit, our model leverages the framework of Mirrored Langevin Dynamics, which gives a general recipe for sampling from constrained distributions using rate-based dynamics. This results in a recurrent circuit model that can accurately infer presence and concentration at scale and can be mapped onto the primary cell types of the olfactory bulb. This framework offers a path towards circuit models---for olfactory sensing and beyond---that both perform well in naturalistic environments and make experimentally-testable predictions for neural response dynamics.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

We present five comprehensive Bioconductor-compatible OrgDb packages consolidating Gene Ontology and InterPro annotations for 2,748 fungal strains spanning five major phyla: Ascomycota (1,610 strains), Basidiomycota (654 strains), Mucoromycota (172 strains), Chytridiomycota (37 strains), and Zoopagomycota (25 strains). These databases achieve 97.5-98.2% GO coverage across over 14 million genes with consistent annotation depth (mean 3.5-3.7 GO terms per gene) and high strain-level coverage (99.3-99.5%). The standardized architecture addresses critical methodological limitations in fungal functional genomics by providing properly structured background gene universes for statistical enrichment analysis, enabling rigorous cross-strain and cross-phylum comparative studies. Integration with established Bioconductor workflows (clusterProfiler, enrichplot, topGO) eliminates technical barriers that have historically impeded comparative analyses. The databases support diverse applications including: (1) RNA-seq differential expression interpretation with fungal-specific functional resolution, (2) systematic profiling of virulence mechanisms in plant pathogenic fungi, (3) metabolic capability assessment for biotechnological strain selection, and (4) cross-phylum functional evolution analysis. Validation against model organism databases confirms 94.7% annotation concordance, while within-phylum analyses reveal 78-92% shared GO term coverage across strains, demonstrating biological coherence of functional signatures. The databases are distributed through GitHub repositories with version control and will be manually updated to incorporate new genome annotations as they become available from public repositories. By providing the first standardized, statistically rigorous functional annotation framework spanning major fungal lineages, this resource democratizes sophisticated comparative genomics approaches and establishes a foundation for reproducible fungal functional genomics research.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

High-performing OECTs are typically fabricated using multistep photolithography and conventional spin-coating and lift-off processes, and while printing techniques have emerged as promising alternatives, they still face challenges in achieving comparable resolutions, reproducibility and performance metrics. Several groups have demonstrated printed OECTs using PEDOT:PSS as the channel material, highlighting the promise of additive manufacturing for scalable bioelectronics. In this work, we build upon these advances and develop an optimized inkjet-printed OECT platform that achieves transconductance values up to 15 mS and sub-millisecond response times as low as 0.31 ms. Our approach systematically optimizes OECT geometrical parameters channel width, length, and thickness through precise patterning and oxygen plasma surface modification to overcome longstanding limitations in inkjet pr`inting resolution and reproducibility. The resulting devices exhibit outstanding electrical stability, high amplification, and fast dynamic response. Using a configuration optimized for biosensing, we demonstrate the detection of the heart failure biomarker NT-proBNP within a clinically relevant range of 10 to 400 pg/mL, with a sensitivity of 0.038% delta IDS/pg/mL. In a separate configuration on a flexible substrate tailored for in vivo biopotential recording, we showcase the device's capabilities by effectively capturing epileptic seizure progression in a rat model with high signal fidelity.

Yet, the molecular details of how the antibody engages A{beta}1-42 fibrils remain unresolved. Using magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance, we show that binding of aducanumab preserves the overall architecture of the A{beta}1-42 fibril core while inducing significant structural and dynamic perturbations in the N-terminal region. Antibody binding markedly reduces flexibility in this domain, with the appearance of sidechain resonances from residues D1, E3, and histidine (likely H6) in dipolar-based experiments. These sidechains--previously observed only in scalar-coupling spectra of the unbound state--indicate rigidification of residues that were dynamic. The interaction extends to S8 and Y10, indicating broader fibril engagement than the minimal epitope (residues 3-7) defined in fragment-based studies. Perturbations in the C-terminal segment (G37-A42) are consistent with its spatial proximity to the antibody-bound N-termini of neighboring monomers. Cryo-TEM images reveal fibrils bundling in the presence of aducanumab, consistent with lateral association via antibody cross-linking, supporting a model where surface coating and steric hindrance suppress secondary nucleation. This mode of action restricts monomer access to catalytic sites on fibril surface, resulting in partial inhibition (~three-fold reduction) of secondary nucleation. The effect depends on high avidity and relatively high stoichiometry, but is ultimately limited by antibody size relative to N-terminal spacing along the fibril. These findings provide atomic-level insights into aducanumab's binding mode and supply a structural framework for understanding antibody-mediated fibril recognition and for guiding next-generation therapies targeting A{beta} aggregates in Alzheimer's disease.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Methods: A combined murine model of pressure overload using transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and diet-induced MASLD was developed to investigate the liver-heart interaction in HFpEF. Cardiac function and structure were assessed by echocardiography and histopathology. Hepatic transcriptomics and cardiac metabolomics were integrated to identify molecular pathways underlying cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction. Results: While left ventricular ejection fraction remained preserved, HFpEF-MASLD mice exhibited significantly worse diastolic function (lower septal e` velocity and higher E/e` ratio), greater left ventricular hypertrophy, and more extensive myocardial fibrosis compared with HFpEF alone. Immunofluorescence demonstrated augmented myocardial inflammation with increased CD3+ T-cell and CD68+ macrophage infiltration in the combined HFpEF-MASLD group. Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated marked down-regulation of genes implicated in retinoic acid signaling, confirmed by reduced expression of retinoic acid receptors (RAR, RAR) and retinol dehydrogenases (RDH) in both hepatic and cardiac tissues. Cardiac metabolomics revealed suppression of arginine biosynthesis, the obligate substrate for endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase, suggesting a potential link to reduced NO-mediated vascular and myocardial signaling. Conclusions: MASLD exacerbates HFpEF through the convergence of inflammatory and metabolic derangements. Disruption of the retinoic acid and arginine-NO pathways may represent an important mechanistic link between hepatic steatosis and diastolic dysfunction, warranting further mechanistic and translational investigation.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

To define the inflammatory mechanisms driving this heterogeneity, we analyzed the inflamed synovium of wild-type (WT), Il6ra-/-, and Il27ra-/-mice with antigen-induced arthritis (AIA). Remarkably, each strain developed a joint pathology mirroring a major RA synovial pathotype: myeloid-rich (WT), fibroblast-rich/pauci-immune (Il6ra-/-), and lymphoid-rich (Il27ra-/-) synovitis. Histology confirmed minimal immune infiltration in Il6ra-/- joints, while WT and Il27ra-/- mice exhibited prominent immune involvement, including organized synovial lymphoid-like aggregates in Il27ra-/- mice. Transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling revealed both shared and distinct regulatory programs among genotypes.

Consistent with synovial ectopic lymphoid-like structures, Il27ra-/- mice showed enrichment of lymphocyte activation (e.g., Il17a, Il22, Bhlhe40). WT mice exhibited hallmarks of MAP kinase activation. These molecular signatures parallel those of fibroblast-, lymphoid-, and myeloid-rich synovitis in RA. Defining a STAT1-STAT3 regulatory interplay influencing transcriptional decisions in WT and Il27ra-/- mice, our findings offer insights into cytokine-driven disease heterogeneity.

For this study, 380 patients were enrolled and will be followed up, including serial collection of biomaterials, for a period of 18 months after the index hospitalisation for AHF. Analysis of AHF-ImmunoCS samples obtained at baseline and at 6-month follow-up from 110 patients showed de novo induction of HRA - as detected by indirect immunofluorescence (IFT) - in 21% of patients (previously published percentage: 32%). The IFT results did not reflect induction of broad anti-heart autoimmunity as autoantibodies against other cardiac antigens like Troponin I3 or Myosin Light Chain 7 were not induced in parallel. To understand what drives HRA induction in these patients we longitudinally immunophenotyped peripheral blood leukocytes at baseline, 6-week and 6-month follow-up by high-resolution spectral flow cytometry. Among lymphocytes, induction of HRA in the wake of acute decompensation of heart failure was associated with a higher proportion of CD4+ T cells among lymphocytes, more CD45RA+ CCR7+ naive conventional, i.e. non-regulatory, and more CXCR3+ CCR4- Th1 cells among CD4+ T cells at baseline. Among myeloid cells, there were no differences at baseline between patients going on to develop HRA and those that did not. However, patients developing HRA had higher proportions of eosinophils (six-month follow-up) and lower proportions of Arginase+ HLA-DR- polymorphnuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells among myeloid cells (six-week and six-month follow-up).

We identify MBOAT2, a lysophospholipid acyltransferase highly induced in activated satellite cells, as a key enzyme that limits the amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in phosphatidylcholine (PC). Lipidomic profiling reveals a characteristic PC signature which is high in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and low in PUFAs in dystrophic, injured, and neonatal muscle, paralleling elevated Mboat2 expression. Given the susceptibility of PUFAs to oxidative damage and the emerging role of lipid peroxidation in driving muscle atrophy during denervation, disuse, and aging, MBOAT2-mediated enrichment of MUFA-PC may represent a protective and pro-regenerative lipid environment. Loss- and gain-of-function approaches confirm that MBOAT2 remodels PC and promotes myogenic repair.

In this study, we employ a multi-pronged computational framework integrating structural analysis, conformational dynamics, mutational scanning, MM-GBSA binding energetics, and conformational and mutational frustration profiling to dissect the mechanisms of ultrapotent neutralization by a cohort of broadly reactive Class 1 antibodies (BD55-1205, 19-77, ZCP4C9, ZCP3B4) and the Class 4/1 antibody ADG20. We reveal a unifying biophysical architecture: these antibodies bind via rigid, pre-configured interfaces that distribute binding energy across extensive epitopes through numerous suboptimal yet synergistic interactions, predominantly with backbone atoms and conserved side chains. This distributed redundancy enables tolerance to mutations at key sites like F456L or A475V without catastrophic loss of affinity. Mutational scanning identifies a hierarchical hotspot organization where primary hotspots (e.g., H505, Y501, Y489, Y421) which overlap with ACE2-contact residues and incur high fitness costs upon mutation are buffered by secondary hotspots (e.g., F456, L455) that are more permissive to variation. MM-GBSA energy decomposition confirms that van der Waals-driven hydrophobic packing dominates binding, with primary hotspots contributing disproportionately to affinity, while electrostatic networks provide auxiliary stabilization that mitigates mutational effects. Critically, both conformational and mutational frustration analyses demonstrate that immune escape hotspots reside in neutral-frustration landscape that permit mutational exploration without destabilizing the RBD, explaining the repeated emergence of convergent mutations across lineages. Our results establish that broad neutralization arises not from ultra-high-affinity anchors, but rather from strategic energy distribution across rigid, evolutionarily informed interfaces. By linking distributed binding, neutral frustration landscapes, and viral fitness constraints, this framework provides a predictive blueprint for designing next-generation therapeutics and vaccines capable of withstanding viral evolution.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

However, the role played by CASP11 in severe SARS-CoV-2 disease and how it impacts adaptive immunity is not identified. Here, we newly discover that CASP11 exacerbates severe SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis by amplifying early innate immune responses while concurrently impairing antiviral CD8 T-cell immunity. Using global knockouts, reciprocal bone marrow chimeras, and phagocyte- monocyte system (PMS) cell-specific CASP11 deletion models, we show that CASP11 deletion in monocyte-derived cells reduces lung inflammation, enhances type I and II interferon signaling, and promotes robust virus-specific effector CD8 T-cell response. This was associated with enhanced viral clearance and improved survival, even under lethal infection conditions. Importantly, CASP11 KO mice also exhibited faster resolution of post-viral inflammation, suggesting a role in long-term immune remodeling.

This mutualistic association enhances host resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses. Balanced and coordinated growth of E. festucae with its host is essential for the establishment and long-term maintenance of the symbiotic relationship. Various E. festucae mutants defective in symbiosis with host plants have been isolated, and notably, many of these symbiosis-defective mutants also lack hyphal fusion ability under culture conditions, supporting a close functional connection between signal transduction required for hyphal fusion and symbiosis establishment. Using a plasmid insertional mutagenesis approach, we identified Cdc25 as an essential regulator of hyphal fusion in E. festucae. Cdc25 encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates the small GTPase Ras. The{Delta} cdc25 strain lost both hyphal fusion ability and the capacity to infect host plants. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that Cdc25 specifically interacts with RasB, one of the five Ras proteins in E. festucae. Expression of constitutively active (CA) RasB in the{Delta} cdc25 strain restored both hyphal fusion and host infection, whereas expression of CA-RasB in the{Delta} mpkB deletion strain failed to rescue its defect in hyphal fusion, suggesting that the Cdc25-RasB signaling module acts upstream of the MAPK cascade. In pathogenic fungi, this signaling module is known to regulate infection-related morphogenesis.

Ferrovales are a common Fe-oxidizing bacterial group observed in AMD globally and thus could be an exceptional target for bioremediation strategies. However, Ferrovales are difficult to culture and both phylogenetically and metabolically diverse. To better understand the potential for Ferrovales to contribute to AMD bioremediation, we circumvented limitations in culture-based approaches and analyzed 240 genomes and metagenome assembled genomes from the Ferrovales, including taxa from AMD sites with high iron oxidation rates. The phylogenetic and physiological diversity of this group was greater than previously known and multiple Ferrovales taxa can co-occur. For example, we observed taxa that varied in mobility (based on the presence or absence of flagellar biosynthesis genes) and taxa that encode multiple iron oxidation pathways. We also identified Ferrovales that are likely capable of anoxygenic photosynthesis.

Guinea pigs were inoculated intranasally with a 300 mL volume to deliver inoculum to both the URT and LRT. Two strains were used to represent the circulating seasonal IAV lineages: influenza A/TX/50/2012 (H3N2) and influenza A/CA/07/2009 (H1N1) virus. The inclusion of a diverse genetic barcode enabled high-resolution tracing of viral dispersal for the H1N1 virus. While infectious virus was consistently detected in the URT, the H1N1 virus could be detected in LRT while the H3N2 virus could not. To determine whether replication of the H1N1 virus in the LRT extends to other modes of infection, virus distribution was evaluated following infection via aerosol exposure or transmission. Infectious virus in lung homogenates was observed in both cases, confirming the LRT tropism of the H1N1 virus. Sequencing genetic barcodes revealed that diversity was largely maintained in nasal samples and trachea but contracted upon dispersal to the lungs.

A major contributor to this diversity is the ubiquitous production of deletion-containing viral genomes (DelVGs), viral RNAs with large internal deletions that arise during replication. DelVGs directly compete with wild-type (WT) genomes, and their accumulation has been implicated in modulating disease severity. However, the specific functional and genetic interactions between DelVGs and WT genomes remain poorly understood. To examine how DelVGs and WT genomes may co-evolve in mixed populations, we serially passaged influenza A virus under sustained high multiplicity-of-infection (MOI) conditions and used next-generation sequencing to build a longitudinal profile of DelVG emergence and dynamics. Early passages yielded a highly diverse repertoire of DelVGs across multiple segments, followed by a sharp contraction in overall diversity and the rise of one to two PB2-derived DelVGs that persisted at sustained high frequency. We identified a single- nucleotide substitution within PB2-derived DelVGs that significantly enhanced their replication and interference, whereas the same mutation proved lethal in the WT background.

We used a de novo assembly pipeline that generates extremely complete and accurate whole genome sequences to generate 50 closed Mtb genomes across all seven major lineages. We identified 3,377 core gene clusters and 379 accessory clusters. Analysis showed multi-copy core clusters were largely due to gene fragmentation (76%), paralogs (12%), nearly identical gene duplications (4%), or combinations (8%). Sixteen hypervariable regions (HVRs) were identified, including novel paralogs and variable PE/PPE genes. We consolidated these findings into a Pangenome Gene Reference Resource (PGRR) for precision alignment. Our study demonstrates the closed nature of the Mtb pangenome, with most variation in accessory genes and HVRs. The PGRR provides a foundation for improved drug/vaccine target discovery and highlights the need to move beyond the commonly used H37Rv strain to study Mtb genetic and phenotypic diversity.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Genital herpes, caused by herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), is among the most prevalent sexually transmitted infections worldwide. Despite evidence linking vaginal Lactobacillus to protection against sexually transmitted viruses, the specific microbial components and mechanisms that mediate this defense are not well understood. Here, we show that multiple cell wall components from diverse gram-positive bacteria, including lactobacilli, inhibit HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection in cells and in a mouse model of genital herpes infection. Peptidoglycan (PG) and lipoteichoic acid (LTA), both major components of the gram-positive bacterial cell wall, significantly reduced HSV infectivity in vitro and improved survival and disease outcomes in mice. We further showed that Lactobacillus crispatus surface layer proteins SlpA and SlpB bind HSV-1 and inhibit infection. Antiviral effects of cell wall components were dose-dependent, relied on intact PG structure, and, in the case of PG and LTA, were independent of TLR2-mediated host signaling. Collectively, our findings identify a species-independent antiviral function for gram-positive bacterial cell wall components against HSV and suggest that the composition of the mucosal microbiome may play an underappreciated role in suppressing mucosal herpes infection in humans.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

The onset of viral infection requires the opening of a trimeric protein, called spike, located on the viral surface essential for binding the host-cell receptors and the subsequent fusion into the host cells. Upon spike-crown opening, one to three Receptor Binding Domains (RBD) rise from the compactly assembled spike head, reaching for the host receptors. Many spike structures were solved that captured RBDs in the different down-to-up trimeric states. These structures not only depict spike's conformational change but also help design the more efficacious antiviral therapeutics. However, such a dynamic crown-opening pathway is hardly described by only few stationary pictures, and questions yet remain. Do all RBDs rise following the same track in the various studies? If they do, what does this track look like? Is there a common adaptive conformational change of spike as its crown opens? Do all trimeric RBDs rise cooperatively in each spike? And how does it relate to the antibody-binding event? Here, a general RBD-rising pathway, describing the crown-opening dynamics using two angular parameters, was proposed based on analyzing the published spike structures. These analyses describe not only the orientational change of individual RBDs, but also the asymmetric rising preference of the trimeric RBDs in a single-spike entity. In addition, the quantified map clearly describes RBD's spatial change upon antibody binding, which is often accompanied by an enlarged crown-opening scale. These findings may provide additional clues to develop therapeutics targeting viral spikes in the future.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

This study examined intraspecific variation in leaf cuticular traits - minimum cuticular conductance following stomatal closure (gmin), and its temperature dependency - across six Australian accessions of Themeda triandra from contrasting climates. Plants were grown under well-watered conditions and exposed to experimental drought. Trait variation and drought responses were quantified in relation to climate-at-origin. For well-watered plants there was no relationship between gmin and accession climate-at-origin. However, under drought, gmin showed clear climate signals, being lower in plants from wetter and cooler regions - in the opposite direction to that predicted. gmin also varied clearly (positively) with leaf mass per area, LMA. The six accessions varied substantially in gmin responses to drought, from negative to positive. Thermal responses in gmin also varied among accessions although, in common, none showed a clear threshold (phase transition) at which gmin increased rapidly. That is, gmin was more thermally stable than expected. Taken together, these findings highlight substantial intraspecific variation in cuticular traits related to water loss, providing initial steps towards a pathway for selecting climate-resilient genotypes for use in grassland restoration and conservation.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Although niche theory is often invoked in investigations of microbiomes, most models assume very high-dimensional coexistence, effectively sidestepping the role of dimensionality. However, direct estimates of niche dimensionality of microbiome have been lacking. Here we use joint species distribution modeling (JSDM) to infer niche dimensionality from relative abundance data alone. In paired 16S rRNA-metabolomics datasets, inferred dimensionality closely tracked the complexity of the metabolic environment, validating our abundance-only approach. Across nearly 200 human gut microbiome studies, lower dimensionality coincided with greater inter-species competition (metabolic niche overlap) and reduced biodiversity, consistent with the macroecological niche dimensionality hypothesis. Consumer/resource simulations reproduced these empirical relationships when both species-intrinsic metabolic tradeoffs and species-extrinsic environmental tradeoffs were imposed, with the latter dominating. Dimensionality was reduced in stressed or diet-simplified microbiomes and correlated broadly with ecological stress markers; negatively with prevalence of generalists and positively with microbial load. Together, these results establish niche dimensionality as a measurable and previously overlooked driver of microbial community structure.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we evaluated the sensitivity of 11 multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) designed to monitor these three stress-related leaf traits across a broad range of environmental and vegetation conditions. For this, we combined radiative transfer modeling with cross-biome field and satellite observations from Sentinel-2, Landsat 8, and MODIS from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), spanning in most major terrestrial ecosystems. Our model-based analysis showed that VIs have a low to moderate sensitivity to their target traits, ranging from water indices with 66% of their variability explained by leaf water content, to carotenoid indices with 27% variability explained by leaf carotenoid content. Surprisingly, our field-based analyses revealed minimal to no sensitivity to leaf water and carotenoid content and chlorophyll/carotenoid ratio across all VIs. In contrast, we showed that leaf area index was the dominant driver of all studied VIs, accounting for 54-74 % of their variability in the field-based analysis. Lastly, we detected that VIs' sensitivity to atmospheric conditions and field sampling issues contribute to their low performance in validating ground truth observations. These findings show that improvements in the VIs formulation and field sampling strategies are needed to increase the reliability of vegetation stress monitoring from multispectral satellites and support a generalized use of VIs across ecosystems.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Although introgression affected only 0.29% of the genome, these regions encompass about 10% of the loci showing strong differentiation between Atlantic and Baltic herring, indicating that natural selection has favored introgressed alleles in functionally important parts of the genome. Adaptive introgression may have been facilitated by shared spawning depths and salinity preferences between Pacific and Baltic herring, in contrast to Atlantic herring, which spawn in deeper, fully marine waters.

Twenty-six groups participated in this solvation \"cryo-ensemble\" prediction challenge, submitting over 350 million atoms in total, offering the first opportunity to compare blind predictions of dynamic solvent shell ensembles to cryo-EM density. Predicted atomic ensembles were converted to density through local alignment and these densities were compared to the cryo-EM densities using Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, mutual information, and precision-recall curves. These predictions show that an ensemble representation is able to capture information of transient or dynamic water and ions better than traditional atomic models, but there remains a large accuracy gap to the performance ceiling set by experimental uncertainty. Overall, molecular dynamics approaches best matched the cryo-EM density, with blind predictions from bussilab_plain_md, SoutheRNA, bussilab_replex, coogs2, and coogs3 outperforming the baseline molecular dynamics prediction.

These strategies cannot resolve which residues are essential, whether non-catalytic sites offer better selectivity or potency, or identify on-target resistance mechanisms. We introduce a framework that integrates precision genome editing, mechanistically diverse therapeutics, and computational sequence-structure-function analysis to map protein essentiality and potential druggability at single amino acid resolution. Applying this framework across 9 cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and 15 cancer therapeutics, including ATP-competitive inhibitors, PROTACs, and molecular glue degraders, we identify shared and CDK-specific residues critical for cell fitness and drug response, including known resistance mutations and dozens of new variants. The resulting functional maps resolve residue- and mechanism-specific differences in the resistance spectra among agents targeting the same protein. We show that this iterative strategy can also uncover higher order interactions by performing intra- and extragenic epistasis screens to identify residues that mediate on-target and within-family cell fitness and drug resistance. Finally, we find evidence of novel CDK6 mutations in breast cancer patients and concordance between experimental and clinical correlates of response to CDK4/6 inhibitors. By mapping residue-level essentiality and forecasting therapy resistance mutations, target-drug interaction maps could inform clinical treatment and guide design of more selective therapeutic molecules.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Met is also an essential amino acid that limits the nutritional value of plant-based diets. Understanding how altered Met levels affect the metabolome, transcriptome, and epigenetic regulation of plant leaves remains an open challenge. This study investigates the impact of ectopic Met accumulation in SSE Arabidopsis leaves of transgenic lines expressing a deregulated form of AtCGS (AtD-CGS) under the seed-specific phaseolin promoter. Unexpected activation of the phaseolin promoter in leaves led to AtD-CGS expression and variable Met accumulation among progeny, despite genetic homozygosity. High-Met (HM) plants showed elevated amino acid and sugar levels, enrichment of stress-related transcripts, and suppression of Met biosynthetic genes, while Low-Met (LM) plants showed reduced Met levels and increased non-CG DNA methylation, especially in centromeric and promoter regions. Integrated transcriptome and methylome analyses revealed that high Met levels were associated with the upregulation of stress hormone pathways (abscisic acid, jasmonate, salicylic acid, and ethylene), downregulation of key epigenetic regulators (e.g., MET1, CMTs), and broader transcriptional reprogramming. By contrast, low Met (LM) lines displayed similar expression levels of genes as control plants. Our findings reveal a complex regulatory network whereby Met accumulation reprograms metabolism, gene expression, and DNA methylation patterns.

Interleukin-4 (IL-4) caused a 10-fold increase in secreted virions with dramatically-altered phospholipid fatty acyl saturation. In contrast, envelopes were not impacted by IL-6 (with/without its soluble receptor IL-6Ra) or dexamethasone-treatment of host cells.

The mechanisms coordinating cell growth with membrane synthesis in any organism are unclear. In Escherichia coli, initiation of phospholipid synthesis by the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase PlsB is regulated by cell growth via an unknown allosteric mechanism. Previous studies have established that PlsB assembles into enzymatically inactive, membrane-bound filaments when overexpressed. We propose that PlsB filamentation regulates PlsB activity and coordinates membrane synthesis with growth. Here, we test our hypothesis by observing the localization of fluorescently labelled PlsB using live-cell microscopy. During growth, PlsB localizes as discrete foci, consistent with formation of inactive filaments. Reducing cellular membrane content eliminates PlsB foci and delocalizes PlsB into the cytoplasm. Restoring membrane synthesis causes PlsB foci to reform after a delay. These results are consistent with our hypothesis and suggest a model in which PlsB reversibly assembles into inactive filaments in response to phospholipid abundance. This mechanism establishes a negative feedback loop that controls initiation of phospholipid synthesis by PlsB and effectively coordinates membrane synthesis with growth.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

Here we describe AXIS, an AI-based Crystal Identification System combining the DINOv2 computer vision model, state-of-the-art transfer learning and MARCO, the largest crystallization dataset available to date, for automated crystal detection. AXIS can operate both with visible and UV light images and integrates a Lab-In-The-Loop approach combing ML and expert inputs for continuous learning and specialization. AXIS enables automated annotation of large crystallization image datasets with performance and accuracy comparable to that of human experts and the Lab-In-The-Loop approach introduced here enables efficient adaptation to local conditions facilitating widespread application, which has been a major limitation to date. AXIS can help correct human errors in image annotation and removes critical bottlenecks, particularly in the context of extensive crystallization screens or high throughput applications like fragment and ligand screening unlocking the potential for higher levels of automation that are key both in fundamental and translational research.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Polyamides are important natural and synthetic polymers, best exemplified by proteins and nylons respectively. Proteins demonstrate that novel polymers with emergent properties can be generated by combining diverse monomers in precisely defined sequences. However, commercial polyamides represent only a small fraction of the potential diversity in polyamide sequences, due to the synthetic challenges of sequence-controlled polymerization. Amide synthetases have been shown to synthesize a broad array of nylon-relevant diads, but the generation of novel sequenced copolyamides requires enzymes capable of acting with longer and more diverse substrates. In this study, we demonstrated that NRPS-independent siderophore (NIS) synthetases, represented by DesD, can ligate oligomeric substrates. A simultaneous enzyme cascade using DesD enabled the synthesis of an oligotriad directly from unprotected substrates. Moreover, the regioselectivity of DesD allowed the selective synthesis of a sequenced amide tetrad, the precursor to a novel sequenced-defined polyamide with properties superior to nylon 66. This study establishes a direct biocatalytic route for the facile synthesis of sequenced oligoamides from unprotected bifunctional substrates, opening new possibilities to synthesize sequenced copolyamides.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "We report here a photosensitized strategy for protein labelling in which N-substituted pyridinium salts are activated using a 2,4-diaryl-N-methyl quinolinium scaffold. Structure-reactivity relationships were performed to optimize the sensitizer structure, and ultimately generated a system that gives protein labelling in minutes at micromolar reagent concentrations. Mechanistic studies suggest a photo-induced electron transfer-based sensitization mechanism. The mildness of this system enabled us to assay sensitization both on individual biomolecules and in complex proteomes and demonstrated excellent compatibility with lysate- and the live-cell-based systems. Imaging of photolabelled HeLa cells were performed and revealed that catalysis occurs in multiple cellular compartments. Chemical proteomics performed at the lysate level resulted in the enrichment of 319 proteins with a 93% selectivity to Tryptophan residues. Live cell labelling resulted in 101 enriched proteins, primarily from the nucleus.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

B.; Besusparis, J.; Laurinavicius, A.; Leh, S.; Weishaupt, H.", "abstract": "The extraction of glomerular image patches is a key step prior to the training and application of glomerular classification models. Numerous algorithms for detecting and segmenting glomeruli have already been described in the literature, but standards for how to extract glomeruli from such an initial annotation remain lacking. Furthermore, the impact of different choices in extracting and preprocessing, such as cropping and scaling, are poorly understood and researched. To address this gap, the current paper introduces the GlomExtractor, a versatile tool implementing the key steps for extracting glomerular patches from whole slide images, including optional filtering of segmentations, patch extraction and scaling, and postprocessing such as background removal. By utilizing the GlomExtractor in combination with glomerular clustering experiments, the current study demonstrated how different processing strategies can impact the performance of downstream machine learning applications. We believe that the GlomExtractor and the experiments demonstrated in the current paper will help researchers in (i) the development of glomerular classification models, in (ii) advancing our understanding of the impact of patch processing on model performance, and in (iii) establishing community standards for how glomeruli should be extracted depending on downstream use.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}

K.; Satbhai, S. B.", "abstract": "[bullet] Iron (Fe) is an essential element for almost all living organisms and its deficiency severely impacts crop productivity and human health. While the mechanisms underlying iron uptake and accumulation are well studied, the role of light in modulating iron homeostasis remains poorly understood. In this study, we report that blue light enhances iron accumulation thereby positively regulating iron homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana. [bullet] Under iron-deficient conditions, root elongation is specifically promoted by blue light, not red light. We further revealed that, light perceived by shoots is required for optimum iron accumulation and for iron deficiency induced increase in root length. [bullet] The transcription factor HY5 (Elongated Hypocotyl 5), mediates these blue light-driven responses. The hy5 mutant showed reduced root elongation under -Fe conditions as well as iron accumulation under blue light as compared to wild-type plants. [bullet] Further we report that CRY1 and CRY2 are the photoreceptor that acts as a connecting link between blue light and HY5 to regulate iron uptake in Arabidopsis. [bullet] Taken together, our work reveals new regulatory mechanism and offers potential insights into optimizing light conditions to enhance iron accumulation and improve the nutritional quality of crops.", "date": "2025-11-03", "journal": ""}
