This kind of perceptual inference challenges current AI systems, highlighting the complexity of the underlying computations. How does the human brain solve this task? Here, we propose a resource-rational model based on learned statistics of object motion to explain how humans judge elasticity. We created 100,000 physics-based simulations of bouncing objects with different elasticities and found that even tiny changes in initial conditions (e.g., orientation) yield starkly different trajectories. Yet, across these simulations, we identified 23 motion features that capture natural variations in elasticity. Although a weighted combination of these features reliably predicts physical elasticity, surprisingly, humans do not seem to employ cue combination when judging elasticity. Instead, we found that observers flexibly switch between different cues, i.e., heuristics. A series of experiments designed to carefully tease apart several competing heuristics, suggests that observers switch between different computationally efficient yet highly informative heuristics depending on the information available in the stimulus.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Although pesticides are novel compounds, pests can quickly develop resistance. Inspired by medical research, we propose an ecologically inspired pest management paradigm that uses pesticides to leverage competitive interactions between pesticide-sensitive and resistant pests. This approach involves reactive pesticide use, monitoring pest responses, and maintaining pest populations below economic injury levels while limiting resistant individuals' proliferation. A mathematical model shows that managing pests' abundance at critical levels, rather than aiming for eradication, delays resistant-pest dominance. By reducing resistant individuals' growth rates and maximizing pesticide-sensitive populations, resistance spread can be hampered. Our findings suggest proactive, ecological, and evolutionary-informed pest management to address threats to food production.

F.; Vaisse, C.; Caspary, T.", "abstract": "Cilia are near ubiquitous cellular appendages critical for cell-to-cell communication and involved in diverse developmental and homeostatic processes. ARL13B is a regulatory GTPase enriched in cilia. We engineered an Arl13b mouse allele, Arl13bV358A, which retains ARL13B biochemical activities but renders ARL13B undetectable in cilia. Surprisingly, these mice are hyperphagic and become obese and insulin resistant. In addition to its GTPase function, ARL13B acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for ARL3. To test whether ARL13B's GEF activity is required to regulate body weight, we analyzed the body weight of mice expressing an ARL13B variant lacking ARL3 GEF activity (Arl13bR79Q). We found no difference in body weight, indicating ARL13B is unlikely to regulate weight via its ARL3 GEF activity. Ciliary ARL13B could control energy homeostasis through a role in development or in adult mice. We induced wildtype ARL13B expression, which localizes to cilia, in 4-week-old Arl13bV358A/V358A mice and found the obesity phenotype and associated metabolic impairments were rescued, consistent with ARL13B regulating homeostatic signaling within cilia in adult mice. These results show that ciliary ARL13B functions to control body weight. Our ability to genetically control the subcellular localization of ARL13B by removing and introducing it into cilia enables us to define the cilia-specific role of ARL13B and provides key information for understanding how cilia act as a signaling hub critical for energy homeostasis.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Stochastic character mapping has emerged as a particularly powerful approach in this regard, allowing researchers to sample histories of discrete variables on phylogenies and better account for the inherent uncertainty of reconstructed ancestral states. Here, we generalize this procedure to work with continuous variables by developing an efficient algorithm for sampling evolutionary histories under Brownian Motion, implemented in a new R package contsimmap. To demonstrate potential applications of these \"continuous stochastic character maps\", we develop a pipeline for inferring relationships between rates of continuous trait evolution and continuously-varying factors (e.g., body size, generation time)---a difficult statistical problem for which relatively few methods are available. After verifying this novel pipeline's performance on simulated data, we use it to show that smaller eucalypt trees tend to exhibit higher rates of flower and leaf trait evolution overall, aligning with well-established predictions based on life history theory as well as empirical patterns in other systems. Ultimately, continuous stochastic character mapping is a valuable new tool for analyzing macroevolutionary data, enabling rigorous yet flexible investigation of complex evolutionary dynamics involving continuous traits and/or continuous variables hypothesized to affect evolutionary processes.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Unfortunately, this technique has remained largely inaccessible at 7T, due to prohibitive cross-modal interference effects and physical constraints. Here, we developed a first-of-its-kind EEG-fMRI acquisition framework on a clinical 7T system combining key improvements from previous research: compact EEG transmission to reduce artifact incidence, reference sensors for artifact correction, and adapted leads for compatibility with a dense radiofrequency receive-array allowing state-of-the-art fMRI sensitivity and acceleration. Two implementations were tested: one using an EEG cap adapted in-house, and another using a recently-designed prototype from an industrial manufacturer, intended to be further developed into a commercial device accessible to the broader community. A comprehensive evaluation in humans showed that simultaneous acquisitions, including sub-millimeter fMRI resolution, could be conducted without detectable safety issues or major practical constraints. The EEG exerted relatively mild perturbations on fMRI quality (6-11% loss in temporal SNR), without measurably affecting the detection of resting-state networks and visual responses. The artifacts induced on EEG could be corrected to a degree where the spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics were comparable to outside recordings, and hallmark features such as resting-state alpha and eyes-closing alpha modulation could be clearly detected.

We evaluated C. difficile occurrence, diversity, circulation and virulence in French Equidae (n=100) after their necropsy in northwestern France (Normandy), from 2019 to 2021. We systematically recovered all cecal contents and any watery (possibly diarrheal) intestinal contents. We isolated C. difficile strains, determined their toxin gene profile by PCR and established their PCR-ribotype according to the WEBRIBO database. We also performed free toxin detection. Twenty-seven Equidae were positive for C. difficile and twenty had a toxigenic strain, including one animal also colonized by a non-toxigenic strain. Toxigenic isolates belonged to eight common ribotypes: i) 078 and 126 (tcdA+ tcdB+ cdt+ according to multiplex PCR, i.e. able to produce toxin A, toxin B and binary toxin), ii) 005, 012, 020, AI-53 and FR227 (tcdA+ tcdB+), and iii) 017 (tcdB+). Non-toxigenic isolates were of ribotypes 009, 035 and 439. Ribotypes 017 and 009 were predominant (n=5). In two cases, Equidae of the same premises shared the same ribotype, either 020 or 009. Free toxins were detected in four animals: they displayed signs of diarrhea and a C. difficile of ribotype 126 (n=1) or 017 (n=3) as the only detected enteropathogen, suggesting a C. difficile infection (CDI). Three of them had received antibiotics. Two had died from an entero-toxic infection, for which C. difficile ribotype 017 was the only identified cause. French Equidae were found to display common pathogenic C. difficile, and ribotype 017 was highly virulent. These findings are of concern from a One Health perspective. Importance C. difficile, a major enteropathogen widely disseminated in the environment, is a One Health issue. Animals are raising concern as human contamination sources. Equidae are in close contact with humans and also develop post-antibiotic and healthcare-associated CDIs. The systematic survey of Equidae necropsied from 2019 to 2021 in the leading region for horse breeding in France, revealed that 20% harbored pathogenic strains. These belonged to clinically important ribotypes, raising the possibility of cross-species, possibly zoonotic transmission. Free toxins, which are rarely tested in animals, were detected in four animals with signs of diarrhea and a toxigenic C. difficile as the only identified enteropathogen, suggesting CDI.

The fusion of satellite cell-derived mononucleated muscle cells (SCMs) is indispensable for the generation of multinucleated, contractile myofibers during muscle repair. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying SCM fusion during muscle regeneration remain poorly understood. In this study, we uncovered an essential role for branched actin polymerization in SCM fusion. Using conditional knockouts of the Arp2/3 complex and its actin nucleation-promoting factors, N-WASP and WAVE, we demonstrated that branched actin polymerization is required for the SCM fusion, but not for satellite cell proliferation, differentiation, and migration. We showed that the N-WASP and WAVE complexes have partially redundant functions in regulating SCM fusion. Furthermore, we revealed that branched actin polymerization is essential for generating invasive protrusions at the fusogenic synapses in SCMs. Taken together, our study has identified new components of the myoblast fusion machinery in skeletal muscle regeneration and demonstrated a critical role for branched actin-propelled invasive protrusions in this process.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Loss of II-spectrin (Sptan1) in the mouse epidermis altered cell shape in all layers and impaired differentiation, and barrier formation. High-resolution imaging and laser ablation revealed that E-cadherin guides differential gradients of actin and spectrin to regulate the layer-specific organization and mechanics of sub-membraneous spectrin-actomyosin networks. This organization is essential to dissipate tension, maintain structural integrity, and retain active growth factor receptor EGFR and the cation channel TRPV3 at the membrane in upper layers to induce terminal differentiation.

Spatially resolving these processes in situ at single-cell resolution is essential to advance our understanding of cellular function and tissue physiology in health and disease. However, existing approaches are limited by either destructive workflows, insufficient spatial resolution and biochemical specificity, or lack of direct linkage to cell identity. Here, we present Raman Enhanced Delineation of Cell Atlases in Tissues (REDCAT), a multimodal all-optical platform that integrates stimulated Raman scattering, autofluorescence redox imaging, second harmonic generation, and high-plex immunofluorescence to co-map metabolic activities and cell types within the same tissue section. REDCAT achieves subcellular resolution profiling of protein, lipid, redox, and nuclear acid metabolism, together with extracellular matrix composition, in both FFPE and fresh-frozen human tissues. Applied to normal lymph nodes, REDCAT delineated distinct redox and lipid remodeling programs across germinal center B-cell zones and immune subsets, highlighting cell-type-specific metabolic specialization. In lymphoma, it revealed profound metabolic reprogramming, including extensive lipid accumulation, nuclear metabolic heterogeneity, and a transitional metabolic state associated with transformation from chronic lymphocytic leukemia to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, thereby illuminating tumor evolution in situ. In human liver, REDCAT resolved cell-type-specific lipid droplet diversity and zonation-dependent nuclear metabolic gradients, uncovering new principles of spatial metabolic organization. By directly linking cell identity with spatial metabolic states at single-cell or subcellular resolution, REDCAT establishes a broadly applicable framework for studying immune function, tumor progression, and tissue physiology, and offers a new path to deciphering the metabolic basis of health and disease.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Despite independent origins, the allotetraploids exhibited substantial overlap in smRNA composition, including transgressive accumulation of smRNA near genes related to transcriptional regulation, cell division and stress response. Consistently, TE-associated 24 nt smRNAs more closely resembled the paternal and larger genome, while shorter smRNAs typically reflected the maternal and smaller genome. Nevertheless, distinct patterns were also evident: the older D. majalis showed greater accumulation of smRNAs near genes involved in transcriptional and translational regulation, while the younger D. traunsteineri displayed stronger non-additive patterns, suggesting ongoing resolution of post-polyploid meiotic and mitotic instability.

This is primarily because opioids cause respiratory suppression and the leading cause of death in opioid overdose is respiratory failure (i.e., opioid-induced respiratory depression, OIRD). Opioid administration can affect the frequency and magnitude of inspiratory motor drive by activating mu-opioid receptors that are located throughout the respiratory control network in the brainstem. This can significantly affect ventilation and blunt CO2 responsiveness, but the precise neural mechanisms that suppress breathing are not fully understood. Previous research has suggested that opioids affect medullary and pontine inspiratory neuron activity by disrupting upstream elements within this circuit. Inspiratory neurons within this network exhibit synchrony consistent with shared excitation from other neuron populations and recurrent mechanisms. One possible target for opioid suppression of inspiratory drive are excitatory synapses. Reduced excitability of these synaptic elements may result in disfacilitation and reduced synchrony among inspiratory neurons. Downstream effects of disfacilitation may result in abnormal output from phrenic motoneurons resulting in distressed breathing. We tested the plausibility of this hypothesis with a computational model of the respiratory network by targeting the synaptic excitability in fictive medullary and pontine populations. The synaptic conductances were systematically decreased while monitoring the overall respiratory motor pattern and aggregate firing rates of subsets of cell populations. Simulations suggest that highly selective, rather than generalized, actions of opioids on synapses within the inspiratory network may account for different observed breathing mechanics.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

First, we induced mPFC functional inhibition and disinhibition, by microinfusion of the GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol or antagonist picrotoxin, respectively, and examined the impact on early reversals (reversals 1-3) and well-established serial reversals (reversal 5 onwards). Using classical performance measures and Bayesian trial-by-trial strategy analysis, we found that mPFC muscimol impaired early, but not serial, reversals, increasing perseveration and impairing exploratory (lose-shift) behavior at reversal 2. In contrast, mPFC picrotoxin impaired serial reversals, reducing exploratory (lose-shift) and exploitative (win-stay) behavior. Second, to inhibit mPFC GABAergic neurons, we expressed the inhibitory DREADD hM4Di in these neurons; chemogenetic mPFC disinhibition by activation of hM4Di also impaired serial reversal learning, primarily disrupting exploitation. Our findings suggest that mPFC hypoactivation and disinhibition disrupt distinct aspects of reversal learning by different mechanisms.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Increases in visual WM load are accompanied by elevated contralateral delay activity (CDA), and EEG alpha-band power. While most WM research focuses on the visual domain, it remains unknown whether similar EEG responses also reflect WM load in the auditory domain. Using EEG, we set out to establish such neural markers of auditory WM load. Participants memorized the pitches of 1 to 4 pure tones presented to one ear, with 1 to 4 identical distractor tones presented to the other ear. Behaviorally, auditory WM capacity plateaued between set-sizes two and three. Unlike for visual WM, auditory WM load was not reflected in lateralized EEG responses. This shows that the CDA is a vision-specific rather than domain-general neural marker of WM load. Applying multivariate pattern analyses on the delay activity revealed that auditory WM load is reflected in patterns of alpha-band oscillations. Surprisingly, a temporal generalization analysis revealed that the alpha patterns reflecting specific load conditions changed throughout the maintenance period (despite load being inherently constant), revealing dynamic coding of auditory WM load.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Multi-resolution Cluster Supervision (MiCS) promotes local fidelity by encouraging cluster assignments - estimated across multiple resolutions - to remain predictable after projection. Evaluated on 20 biomedical datasets, UMAP+LMC and MiCS+LMC achieve the best overall performance, demonstrating that global and local structure can be optimized simultaneously rather than being inherently conflicting.

F.", "abstract": "This paper addresses the increasing need for comprehensive mathematical descriptions of cell organization by examining the algebraic structure of mitochondrial network dynamics. Mitochondria are cellular structures involved in metabolism that take the form of a network of membrane-based tubes that undergo continuous re-arrangement by a set of morphological processes, including fission and fusion, carried out by protein-based machinery. Because of their network structure, mitochondria can be represented as graphs, and the morphological operations that take place in the cell, referred to as mitochondrial dynamics, can be represented by changes to the graphs. Prior studies have classified mitochondrial graphs based on graph-theoretic features, but an alternative approach is to focus not on the graphs themselves but on the set of morphological operations inducing mitochondrial dynamics, since this may provide a simpler representation. Moreover, the operations are what determine the graphs that will be generated in a biological system. Here we show that mitochondrial dynamics constitute a groupoid that includes the automorphism group of each mitochondria graph. For multi-component mitochondria we define a graph structure that encapsulates the structure of mitochondrial dynamics. Using one of the morphological operations we can define an equivalence relation among mitochondrial graphs that allows us to replace the complex structure of the full groupoid with a vastly simpler groupoid representation based on equivalence classes. Using these formalisms we define a distance metric for similarity between mitochondrial structures based on an edit distance. In the course of defining these structures we provide a mathematical motivation for new experimental questions regarding mitochondrial fusion, the impacts of cell division on mitochondrial morphology, and the presence of a single giant component in some cell types. This work points to a general strategy for formulating a cell structure state-space, based not on the shapes of cellular structures, but on relations between the dynamic operations that produce them.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Notably these studies use 'arms' comprising a single duplex whereas more complex nanostructures, DNA origami, can have a multitude of duplexes bundled together to produce different structural properties. Herein I introduce DNAns bundling two duplexes together, commonly known as the double crossover (DX) motif to enable multi scale mechanical design of hydrogels with interchangeable strands, i.e. modular DX-DNAns hydrogels. This is achieved by rational design of the internal structure to coordinate the propagation of forces both within and across the different motifs driving unique organizational aspects which produce specific viscoelastic features, as evidenced by bulk-scale rheological profiles herein. This work begins to bridge the broad range of complexities available with DNA origami based nanostructures to the more application based potentials for macro-scale nanostructured materials with specified functionalizations. Particularly I elucidate the versatility of this method by implementing a DNA based pH response motif, i-motif, which has thus far only enabled switchable mechanical properties from the gel-to-sol states but herein there are graded changes in mechanistic properties while sustaining the gel state, a feat which has only been achieved via strand displacement in DNAns hydrogels thus far.

The P. aeruginosa BqsRS two-component system regulates biofilm formation and dispersal by sensing extracytoplasmic Fe2+, but the mechanistic details of this process are poorly understood. In this work, we report the crystal and solution structures of the PaBqsR response regulator receiver domain, comprising a ({beta})5 response regulator assembly, and the DNA-binding domain, comprising a helix-turn-helix motif. Consistent with its cognate stimulus being Fe2+, we show that PaBqsR binds directly to the promoter region of the feo operon that encodes the bacterial Fe2+ transport system FeoABC. Corroborating these in vitro results, transcriptional studies show that PaBqsR is a global regulator controlling many important genes in PAO1, including the feo operon. Intriguingly, promoter-based assays reveal that PaBqsR is a dynamic regulator that responds to bioavailable Fe2+, likely through the ability of PaBqsR to bind Fe2+ directly via a His-rich motif, independent of the PaBqsS membrane His kinase. This mode of regulation is unprecedented among OmpR-like response regulators but represents an important level of control over Fe2+ acquisition in P. aeruginosa that could be an attractive therapeutic target to treat nosocomial infections.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

At the heart of many such statistics is the computation of extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH), which captures the decay of homozygosity away from a focal site. This computation, repeated for potentially millions of sites, is computationally demanding, as it involves tracking counts of unique haplotypes iteratively over long genomic distances and across many individuals. Because of these computational challenges, existing tools do not scale well when applied to large-scale population datasets, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, or the UK Biobank with 500,000 individuals. Optimizing computation becomes crucial when data sets grow large, especially when handling large sample sizes or generating training data for machine learning algorithms. Here, we propose a dynamic programming algorithm that substantially improves runtime and memory usage over existing tools on both real and simulated data. On real phased data, we achieve 5-50x speedup with minimal memory footprint. Our simulations show an even more pronounced performance gap with large populations (up to 15x speedup and 46x memory reduction).

Natural speech encodes cues at distinct timescales: phonetic features have modulation frequencies of 30-50 Hz, syllables and words around 4-7 Hz, and phrases 1-2 Hz. Strikingly, these frequencies mirror frequencies of endogenous network rhythms of the brain and synaptic time constants of the underlying neural circuits. Here, we suggest that endogenous brain rhythms serve as priors for speech recognition, encoding knowledge of speech structure in the dynamics of network computations. In a network of coupled oscillators, we find that speech is readily identified when characteristic frequencies of the oscillators match frequencies of circuit rhythms in the brain. When signal and circuit rhythms are mismatched, speech identification is impaired. Compared to a baseline recurrent neural network without intrinsic oscillations, the coupled oscillatory network has significantly higher performance in speech recognition across languages, but not in the recognition of signals that lack speech-like structure, such as urban sounds. Our results suggest a central computational role of brain rhythms in speech processing.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

M.; Macdonald, S. J.", "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping have often yielded seemingly contradictory results, with GWAS typically suggesting highly polygenic architectures while QTL mapping identifies fewer loci of larger effect. We investigated this discrepancy using a published mapping study that contrasted pools of control flies with pools of flies representing the most zinc chloride-resistant larvae. The dataset provided a unique opportunity to compare three distinct analytical approaches: an X-QTL mapping strategy based on inferring known founder haplotype frequencies, a SNP-by-SNP GWAS using directly ascertained SNP counts, and a SNP-by-SNP GWAS using imputed SNP counts derived from estimated haplotype frequencies. Our analysis revealed that X-QTL and imputed SNP approaches uncovered a relatively simple genetic architecture dominated by several major-effect loci. In contrast, the traditional SNP-by-SNP GWAS suggested a highly polygenic trait with numerous small-effect loci dispersed throughout the genome. We demonstrate that this apparent discrepancy primarily stems from the limited statistical power of the SNP-by-SNP GWAS approach when applied to pooled sequencing data. Despite ~700X sequence coverage and greater than 3000 flies per treatment, the inferred polygenic architecture under the SNP-by-SNP approach appears to simply be an artifact of insufficient power to detect major effect loci. Through simulations, we illustrate that reliably detecting subtle allele frequency differences between pools requires substantially larger sample sizes and higher sequencing coverage than typically employed in current studies.

The paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus is a major source of oxytocin and sends projections to the mesolimbic dopamine system and the extended amygdala. Previous work found that social defeat increased oxytocin neuron activity in the anterior PVN (aPVN) but not posterior PVN (pPVN). We reduced oxytocin synthesis with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides in either anterior or posterior PVN in California mice (Peromyscus californicus), a strong model system for studying effects of social stress on brain function and behavior. Antisense morpholinos in aPVN had no effect on behavior in unstressed females but increased social approach and reduced social vigilance in females exposed to social defeat stress. In pPVN, antisense morpholinos reduced social approach in unstressed male and female California mice. We then used OxtCre mice to compare electrophysiological profiles of oxytocin in aPVN and pPVN with a population of oxytocin neurons in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Oxytocin neurons in aPVN and BNST oxytocin neurons had higher post-synaptic potentials and responded more strongly to current injections versus oxytocin neurons in pPVN.

Wsb2 recognizes Bcl-xl through a motif conserved between Bcl-xl, Bcl-w and Bcl2, but not Mcl1. Disruption of this interaction through mutation of either Bcl-xl or Wsb2 blocks the binding of Wsb2 to the Bcl-xl/Bim dimer.

We investigated microbiome assembly in fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR from 12 species and species groups collected across the Northeastern United States. We hypothesized that firefly microbiomes are predominantly structured by stochastic ecological processes, such as random microbial exposures. Consistent with this, we observed elevated normalized stochasticity ratio (NST) values for most bacteria, coupled with high intraspecific variability in bacterial abundance and composition. However, microbiomes were more similar among closely related firefly hosts, and several bacterial taxa, including endosymbionts and unusually prevalent mollicute strains, showed lower NST values, species-specific associations, and patterns linked to geography, season, and sex. These results reveal that deterministic processes--likely involving host-driven microbial filtering, microbe-microbe interactions, and reliable transmission modes--act alongside stochastic forces to shape firefly-microbe associations. By disentangling these ecological drivers in a diverse, understudied beetle lineage, our study advances understanding of the ecological and evolutionary processes structuring microbiomes in the wild.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

However, subsequent studies either bypassed this step and reported knockouts based on direct crosses with Cre mouse lines, leaving residual lacZ/neo sequences that may silence upstream elements or introduce transcriptional artifacts or rare studies used less efficient FLPe Deleter mice. Here, we present a detailed and refined strategy to conditional miR-141/200c knockouts mice using FLPo Deleter mice to efficiently eliminate lacZ/neo cassettes. Our approach not only confirmed complete deletion of miR-141 and miR-200c in various organs such olfactory bulbs and lungs where these miRNAs are robustly expressed using various approach such as genotyping qPCR validation and in situ hybridization but showed that without the use of FLPo deleter mice deletion of miR-141/200c cluster may also lead to loss of several close proximity physiologically important genes such as ptpn6, phb2, atn1 and eno1 .

Using whole-organ clearing and 3D imaging, we mapped pancreatic sympathetic innervation, revealing specialized anatomical integration between sympathetic nerves and islets. Transplanted islets intrinsically attracted sympathetic nerves independent of their native environment. Chronic islet injury disrupted sympathetic innervation and impaired nerve regeneration after denervation.

These subunits assemble with a precise stoichiometry and arrangement, such that two distinct agonist-binding sites are formed at interfaces between a principal -subunit and a complementary {delta} or {epsilon}/{gamma}-subunit. Chemical differences between the two complementary subunits are presumed to confer functional inequivalence to the two agonist sites. This interpretation, however, overlooks the asymmetric architecture of the acetylcholine receptor, which places each subunit, and therefore each agonist site, at unique positions within the heteropentamer. The extent to which functional inequivalence of the agonist sites stems from this structural asymmetry, as opposed to chemical differences, remains unexplored. Here, we reconstruct an ancestral subunit capable of substituting for both complementary subunits, thereby engineering hybrid ancestral/human acetylcholine receptors with chemically identical agonist sites. Despite being chemically identical, these agonist sites remain functionally inequivalent. We show that this functional inequivalence stems from distinct intersubunit interactions dictated by the receptor's heteropentameric architecture, which also underlie the subunit-dependent effects of a human disease-causing mutation. Thus, structural asymmetry emerges as a fundamental determinant of receptor function, capable of imposing functional inequivalence even in chemically identical sites, with implications for both the evolution of heteromeric protein complexes and the molecular basis of disease.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

While previous studies have identified musical features that contribute to the groove experience, such as syncopation and tempo, they also report individual differences in which kinds of music people experience groove. Therefore, recommending groove-eliciting music requires accounting for individual differences. In this study, we aimed to develop a groove brain-music interface (G-BMI) that generates personalized playlists to maximize each individual's groove experience, using a neurofeedback system based on in-ear EEG. Twenty-four participants listened to three high-groove and three low-groove musical excerpts and rated their \"urge to move.\" Using these ratings and the recorded EEG, we trained two LASSO models to build the G-BMI. Model 1 predicted urge to move from acoustic features extracted with VGGish, a pretrained neural network. Model 2 classified EEG data as recorded during listening to high-groove or low-groove music. Using Model 1, we ranked 7,225 candidate songs by predicted groove and assembled one groove-augmenting and one groove-diminishing playlist. Using Models 1 and 2, we created two additional playlists that updated Model 1 and the ranking in real-time based on in-ear EEG.

While genome-wide analyses have revealed that intramolecular epistatic interactions can drive the spatial clustering of amino acid substitutions, direct empirical evidence for such interactions and their evolutionary consequences remains limited. Using a population genetic screen for spatially-clustered and lineage-specific adaptive amino acid substitutions in Drosophila proteins, we systematically identify experimentally tractable candidates for functional analysis. As proof of concept, we focus on the Trio protein, a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor that exhibits three spatially-clustered adaptive amino acid substitutions in the D. melanogaster lineage. By systematically reconstructing evolutionary intermediates in vivo using genome editing, we find that all possible intermediate states exhibit reduced viability and/or locomotor defects, providing strong evidence for epistatic constraints on evolutionary trajectories. Notably, these deleterious effects are recessive, suggesting that intermediate combinations of epistatically interacting amino acid substitutions can accumulate in heterozygotes prior to fixation, thereby circumventing apparent constraints imposed by maladaptive intermediate states. Together, these findings provide a rare empirical view of the fitness landscape shaped by intramolecular epistasis and establish a framework for investigating the constraints on adaptive protein evolution in diploid multicellular organisms.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Twenty percent of patients survive beyond three years, but known clinical factors like age, performance status, resection extent, and MGMT promoter methylation status do not fully explain the observed outcomes. Objective: Our objective was to identify novel histology derived biomarkers associated with end-of-spectrum overall survival (OS) to provide novel biological insight with a translational potential. Methods: We analyzed a total of 748 GBM patients from 3 different cohorts, uniquely enriched in long survivors (n=98 with overall survival (OS) > 5y including n=196 with OS[&ge;]3y), with clinical data and H&E slides obtained from the primary tumor at baseline. We propose an interpretable machine learning (ML) methodology for the discovery of histological biomarkers. Our method learned to segment each H&E slide into three distinct regions associated with long-term survival, short-term survival, and non-informative tissue. We characterized these regions by integrating unsupervised learning, nuclei segmentation, blood vessels detection, pathologist annotations, and multimodal data including spatial transcriptomics from n=31 patients of the GBM MOSAIC dataset to discover fully interpretable biomarkers. Results: Our OS prediction model using histology and clinical data as input achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 for the classification of patients between OS<2 and OS[&ge;]3y in external cohort validation, outperforming significantly models trained on clinical data or on histology alone (AUC of 0.76; 0.73, respectively). Two novel biomarkers were predicting poor survival: the presence of regions of lowly infiltrated white matter enriched in malignant cells with a mesenchymal-like phenotype, and lower levels of angiogenesis associated with higher hypoxia response in the main tumor regions. We also found that a subtype of immunosuppressive tumor macrophages - defined by high PLIN2 expression and lipid accumulation- is consistently enriched in histological areas predictive of poor prognosis. Conclusion: Our interpretable ML methodology identified a novel prognostic impact of biological processes and cell types according to distinct tumor regions of GBM.

To study the role of TMEM106B in myelination in vivo, we mutated zebrafish tmem106ba and tmem106bb homologs. In vivo brain imaging in larvae deficient for both homologs (tmem106bdm) showed more, smaller lysosomes, accompanied by reduced myelin content and shorter myelin sheaths.

We next genome-edited the pathogenic p.(Asp252Asn) variant into the zebrafish genome and showed that it acts dominant-negatively on myelination and on lysosomal clustering around the nucleus in oligodendrocytes. As lysosomal peri-nuclear positioning modulates mTOR-signaling, and downstream transcription factor EB (TFEB) inhibits myelination, we next investigated whether there is a genetic interaction between TMEM106B and TFEB. Indeed, deficient myelination in tmem106bdm larvae, but not altered lysosomal clustering, was restored by loss of Tfeb in triple mutant larvae.

While recent deep learning approaches have shown promising results, several challenges remain: the lack of a comprehensive training dataset, architectures lacking communication between representations of enzymes and small molecules, the tendency to simplify the problem as enzyme-substrate vs. enzyme-non-interacting, and thereby, misclassify enzyme-inhibitor pairs as substrates, and the negligence of the true impact of data leakage on the model's performance. To address these issues, we present EMMA (Enzyme-small Molecule interaction Multi-head Attention), a transformer-based multi-task learning framework designed to learn pairwise interaction signals between enzymes and small molecules, that can well generalise to out-of-distribution data. EMMA operates directly on the SMILES string representation of small molecules and enzyme sequences, with two classification heads that distinguish enzyme-non-interacting, enzyme-substrate, and enzyme-inhibitor pairs. By evaluating EMMA under five distinct data-splitting regimes that control for different types of data leakage, we demonstrate that EMMA achieves a strong and robust performance, particularly for previously unseen combinations of enzymes and small molecules.

Zinc ions (Zn2+), the second most abundant plasma cation, have been shown to bind and regulate the activity of certain coagulation proteins can also bind and modulate the activity of several coagulation proteins through structural alterations. However, their role in membrane-protein interactions remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how Ca2+ and Zn2+; influence the structure and function of human protein Z (PZ), a cofactor of protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) that inhibits clotting factor Xa on phospholipid surfaces. Zn2+ was found to substitute for Ca2+ in the Gla domain of PZ and promote its membrane binding by inducing conformational changes like Ca2+. Additionally, a Zn2+ located in the epidermal growth factor1 (EGF1) domain of PZ appeared to synergize with Ca2+ to enhance the membrane affinity of PZ. Furthermore, both Ca2+ and Zn2+ were suggested to destabilize PZ-ZPI complex, thereby modulating the cofactor activity of PZ, a finding that warrants further experimental investigations. Collectively, this study provides the first structural and functional characterization of Zn2+ bound PZ, offering new insights into metal ion driven structural dynamics of PZ and their implications in coagulation regulation.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

The immune defenses preventing gut colonization and dissemination remain poorly defined. Herein, we uncover distinct and context-dependent roles for complement proteins C3 and C4 in host defense following K. pneumoniae infection. Following gut colonization, C3 and C4 levels rise significantly. In addition to inducing alternative pathway-mediated C3b deposition on K. pneumoniae grown under gut-relevant conditions, C3 is critical for recruiting myeloid cells to the gut, promoting local opsonophagocytosis, and preventing lethal systemic spread. Depletion of systemic C3 reveals mucosal-derived C3 controls K. pneumoniae GI colonization, whereas systemic C3 is essential for limiting fatal dissemination. In contrast, C4 is dispensable for controlling GI colonization, dissemination, and myeloid recruitment under conditions of natural acquisition. However, C4 becomes critical for controlling GI burden and systemic disease following antibiotic-induced dysbiosis and supercolonization with antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae. Collectively, these findings reveal a dual-layered immune strategy: C3-driven opsonophagocytosis is critical for controlling colonization and dissemination under baseline conditions, while C4 becomes indispensable following antibiotic-induced supercolonization. This work advances our understanding of complement-dependent mucosal immune protection and identifies potential targets for preventing gut-to-bloodstream transition of this pathogen.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

L.; Thomas, S.; Kiebler, M.; Boyce, A.; Goetze, B.", "abstract": "Quantitative fluorescence microscopy is more reproducible when instrument performance is measured and incorporated into the analysis. We show that routinely monitored quality-control (QC) metrics like the system resolution and inter-channel co-registration are determinant variables that can be used to normalize common image readouts and thereby separate instrument-induced variation from genuine biological changes. For intra-channel morphometry, a Gaussian approximation of the fluorescence imaging process yields analytical factors that predict how geometric measurements (length, separation distance, area, volume, etc.) inflate and scale with resolution blur due to optical misalignments or natural optical quality variations. We validate this behavior by deliberately perturbing the system resolution and by exploiting the natural resolution differences in three nominally equivalent objective lenses configured to image the exact same synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons, where structural differences subtle by eye nonetheless produced statistically significant shifts in measured synaptic puncta volumes. For dual-channel colocalization (overlap) measurements, we normalize the inter-channel co-registration QC metric by the measured point-spread function (PSF) resolutions (rather than theoretical limits associated with the objective lens) and demonstrate how fluorescent pre/postsynaptic cleft protein overlap signals decay in a predictable, exponential fashion as the PSF-normalized registration error increases, with the decay rate depending on the imaged object relative to the PSF size ratio. Mapped field-of-view gradients in channel registration also explain feature orientation flips/rotations and overlap loss without any underlying biological change . Finally, we outline a simple QC-aware microscope normalization workflow where each image measurement dataset is paired with its session PSFs and local co-registration error to remove instrument bias and optionally re-project the results to a declared reference PSF without altering the raw images. This approach improves image measurement accuracy and cross-instrument comparability of experiments and reframes light microscope QC from a passive certification of instrument health into a practical normalization that links the acquisition state to quantitative outcomes, thus ensuring the reliability and interpretability of morphometric and colocalization data in fluorescence microscopy.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Upregulation of AcylCoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1/SOAT1), the enzyme responsible for retinal CE formation, has been implicated in pathological retinal neovascularization. Here we determine the role of this process in diabetic retinopathy (DR). Ins2Akita diabetic mice were treated with the specific ACAT1/SOAT1 inhibitor K604 (10 mg/Kg, i.p.) beginning at 10 weeks for 2 weeks or 8 months for 2 months. ACAT1/SOAT1 expression and CE formation were assayed along with oxidative stress, inflammation, vascular pathology, and neuronal function. ACAT1/SOAT1 expression was also assayed in human retinas and vitrectomy specimens. Retinas from early-stage Ins2Akita mice exhibited increases in CE deposition, superoxide production, and expression of ACAT1/SOAT1, LDLR, TREM1, MCSF, and VEGF along with leukostasis, vascular leakage, acellular capillary formation, retinal ganglion cell loss, and impaired visual function. Late-stage increases in CE, ACAT1/SOAT, oxidative stress, inflammation, and impaired visual function were also observed. These changes were significantly inhibited by K604 treatment. The protective effects were independent of changes in systemic glucose or body weight. Human retina and vitrectomy samples also showed increases in ACAT1/SOAT1 and CE, respectively. Specific inhibition of ACAT1/SOAT1 with K604 normalizes ACAT1/SOAT1 expression and CE formation and prevents increases in oxidative stress and inflammation and preserves retinal structure and function in both early and late stages of DR. These findings identify ACAT1/SOAT1 as a promising therapeutic target for both early intervention and later stage treatment of DR.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Unfortunately, efficacious adjuvants for licensed native polysaccharide vaccines are lacking. The TLR4 agonist, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), significantly increases antibody responses to capsular polysaccharides in mice via B cell-intrinsic TLR4 and MyD88-dependent signaling. However, due to the lack of TLR4-driven adjuvant effects on polysaccharide-specific responses in non-human primates and the limited responsiveness of human B cells to TLR4 agonists, we sought to identify alternative MyD88-activating TLR agonists that could serve as suitable adjuvants to enhance humoral responses to polysaccharide vaccines in humans. In vitro assays revealed the TLR1/2 agonist Pam3CSK4 synergized with strong BCR crosslinking to optimally enhance both mouse and human B cell activation and antibody secretion. In vivo, Pam3CSK4 alone had no effect, but when paired with a squalene-based emulsion significantly increased polysaccharide-specific antibodies in both immunocompetent and PBMC-humanized mice that proved highly protective against lethal pneumococcal infections. Although a dual TLR2-7 agonist showed similar potent in vitro activity, it failed to enhance polysaccharide-specific IgG responses in vivo, mirroring the antagonistic effects observed when TLR2 and TLR7 agonists were combined both in vitro and in vivo. By contrast, inclusion of Pam3CSK4 in an adjuvant containing MPL, synthetic cord factor, and squalene emulsion further augmented protective polysaccharide-specific antibody responses in mice and rescued adjuvant effects in non-human primates.

E.; Fiszbein, A.; Proudfoot, N. J.; Kornblihtt, A.

In parallel, ASO1 also elicits the deployment of the silencing histone mark H3K9me2 on the SMN2 gene, creating a roadblock to RNAPII elongation that downregulates E7 inclusion. By removing the roadblock, HDACi counteract the undesired chromatin effects of the ASO, resulting in higher E7 inclusion, which allowed us to propose a combined therapy for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We show here that the histone methyl transferase G9a is involved in the ASO1-elicited deployment of H3K9me2 not only at the SMN2 E7 region, located towards the 3' end of the gene, but also at its promoter. Furthermore, using a CRISPR/dCas-based (dead-Cas9-based) strategy, we show that targeting H3K27 histone acetylation at the SMN2 E7 region duplicates the HDACi effect, which overcomes potentially pleiotropic effects. Most noticeably, when acetylation is targeted to the E7 region alone, the 30-kbp-distant promoter becomes acetylated and activated. These cross-talks between the two ends of the SMN2 gene prompted us to use chromosome conformation analysis (3C) to find that ASOs can promote gene looping. This novel property of ASOs depends on cohesin and may explain promoter activation by distant alternative splicing events.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Although mercury-methylating communities are well characterized, the microbial guilds contributing to methylmercury accumulation in rice paddies remain unclear. Here, we collected paddy soils across a mercury concentration gradient throughout the rice growing season to identify microbial and environmental factors influencing methylmercury dynamics. We show that hgcA gene abundance, the key gene required for methylation, was not a significant predictor of methylmercury concentration in paddy soils. We also show that merB gene abundance correlated with methylmercury in mercury-polluted rhizosphere samples. Methane cycling genes were actively expressed, and their beta-diversity was significantly associated with methylmercury levels. Methanogen abundance correlated with higher methylmercury under elevated total mercury concentrations. Analysis of the methanotroph-associated mbnT gene, implicated in demethylation, revealed an unexpected positive correlation with methylmercury. Multiple regression and machine learning models converged on mercury bioavailability and methanogen/methanotroph abundances as key predictors of methylmercury, with methanogen-associated hgcA gene abundance and methanogen-methanotroph interactions highlighted under flooded, low-redox conditions.

However, its clinical application has been hampered by the low efficiency of cell direct reprogramming and the immature state of the inducing cells. Developing novel strategies to enhance direct reprogramming efficiency and yield mature functional cardiomyocytes remains a critical challenge. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of Psr on cardiac reprogramming using RepSox and Forskolin (RF) as the baseline cocktail. Reprogramming efficiency, cardiomyocyte marker expression, and calcium handling were assessed by RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence. Ultrastructural features were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Metabolic profiles were analyzed using Seahorse assays. Transcriptomic changes were explored by RNA sequencing, followed by pathway and protein-protein interaction analyses. A myocardial infarction (MI) mouse model was used for in vivo validation. RESULTS: Supplementation with Psr (10 uM) markedly enhanced the induction of induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs), leading to earlier appearance of beating clusters (day 1 vs. day 6?8), improved sarcomere organization, robust calcium transients, and higher energy metabolism. Transcriptomic profiling identified activation of the PPAR signaling pathway, with PPAR, RXRG, and UCP1 as central regulators. Mechanistically, Psr promoted mitochondrial fission, thereby facilitating metabolic remodeling essential for cardiomyocyte maturation. In vivo, RF+Psr treatment significantly improved cardiac function and reduced fibrosis after MI compared to RF alone. CONCLUSION: Psr enhances direct cardiac reprogramming by activating PPAR signaling and promoting mitochondrial fission. These findings provide a novel mechanistic framework and suggest psoralen as a promising natural enhancer for cardiac regeneration strategies.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Here we report on observations that strongly suggest that a checkered beetle species behaves as a parasitoid of ant brood. A total of 146 colonies or part of colonies of three species of the Ectatomma ruidum species complex (E.ruidum sp. 2, 3, 4) were excavated in several sites along the Pacific coastal plains of Oaxaca, Mexico, during three collecting campaigns (2015-2017). Overall, 11060 adults, 5795 cocoons and 2185 larvae were examined. Upon dissection, four intact cocoons contained ant prepupae/pupae parasitized by characteristic campodeiform beetle larvae (prognathous head, three pairs of segmented legs on thorax, no prolegs, body with sparse but long pubescence), and a fifth cocoon presented a round exit hole. An active, pink-colored larva, emerged from a cocoon in 2015, was reared to the adult stage and could be identified as Phyllobaenus obscurus (Gorham) (Cleridae). Second and third instar larvae were found inside intact cocoons of two species: E.ruidum sp. 3 and sp. 4. The prevalence of parasitism is extremely low: less than 0.6% of cocoons available in each Ectatomma host populations. Predatory during both adult and larval stages, checkered beetles are broadly known as predators of wood-boring and cone-boring beetles, and some species are facultative parasitoids of solitary bees or wasps or, very rarely, specialized in predating social insects. We assert that the novel discovery of clerid-ant brood parasitoidism within the subterranean host colony deviates yet further from any known clerid adaptation to date.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Various scoring techniques and independence tests, such as local scores (e.g., Degenerate Gaussian (DG) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)) and independence tests (e.g., Fisher's Z), have been employed in causality estimation. However, these local scores often excel in specific data types or application areas but falter in others, limiting their ability to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of underlying causal mechanisms. For instance, a method may perform well on linear relationships or continuous variables but struggle with discrete variables or non-linear relationships. Real-world observational datasets, particularly those generated in complex biological systems, often contain diverse data types and relationships, making it essential to develop a more comprehensive approach. To address this challenge, we propose a novel causal estimation framework that leverages the powerful classification capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) to identify causal patterns in pairwise relationships. Our framework integrates multiple local causality estimation scores, independence tests, and variable attributes, allowing it to capture a wide range of causal mechanisms. To ensure the framework's robustness and generalizability, we incorporate a diverse range of simulation data and 10 curated real-world datasets into the training procedure. Furthermore, our framework is designed to be extensible, enabling users to easily integrate their own data and additional scores and tests. Our validation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods in terms of estimation accuracy and precision on both simulation data and real-world biological datasets.

Although protein modelling tools have rapidly advanced, their accuracy on TCR-pMHC complexes is hampered by CDR loop hypervariability, conformational flexibility, and the lack of reliable quality assessment without experimental references. To evaluate the performance of recent protein modelling algorithms on TCR-pMHC complexes, we benchmarked three general-purpose (AlphaFold3, Boltz-2, Chai-1) and two TCR-specific (tFold-TCR, TCRmodel2) modelling tools using a benchmark set of 20 experimentally determined PDB structures, demonstrating AlphaFold3 superior performance. To expand structural coverage beyond the existing experimental landscape, we present a framework that enables quality assessment of TCR-pMHC structural models without requiring experimental reference structures. To this end, we integrate multiple modelling and interface confidence metrics (pLDDT, ipTM, iPAE, pDockQ) into explainable random forest classifiers trained on 1160 models of 232 experimentally determined PDB TCR-pMHC class I complexes. This approach reliably distinguishes low-, acceptable-, medium-, and high-quality models, outperforming the combination of these metrics using literature-established thresholds.

Methods: We combined Visium HD spatial transcriptomics, imaging mass cytometry, and single-cell RNA-seq across fatty-streak, advanced, and restenotic plaques to map myeloid architectures and relate them to lesion geography and extracellular matrix features. Slingshot trajectory analysis resolved macrophages differentiation path. In vitro, we tested microenvironmental and lipid cues separately: fibronectin (FN) exposure during PMA-driven THP-1 differentiation and oxidized LDL (oxLDL)-induced foam cell formation in murine bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs). Results: Our analysis identified seven macrophage subsets and two neutrophil populations with distinct spatial distribution and functional roles. In early lesions, neutrophils expressing MMP9, MPO, p47phox, TGF-{beta}1 and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5), aligned with proteolysis, inflammatory processes, and endothelial-mesenchymal transition features. In advanced plaques, macrophage subsets exhibit specialized functions: Ki67+ proliferative macrophages localized near necrotic cores, sustaining local population; SPP1+ macrophages, enriched in lipid handling and tissue remodeling, are prone to apoptosis/ferroptosis, potentially promoting necrotic core expansion; and C3aR+ macrophages form antigen-presenting niches with elevated HLA-DR and CD74, engaging T cells possibly through CXCL12?CXCR4 signaling. Slingshot trajectories indicated progression from C3aR+ toward SPP1+ remodeling states concentrated at fibronectin-rich rims. In vitro, FN increased MMP9 and TIMP1 in THP-1-derived macrophages, consistent with FN imprinting remodeling features characteristic of SPP1? macrophages in situ. Concurrently, oxLDL-treated BMDMs showed enhanced lipid-handling and remodeling modules consistent with the SPP1 program.

Across multiple tissue contexts, we identified that macrophages do not adopt a uniform metabolic profile but typically co-exist in four discrete metabolic states with distinct dependence on OXPHOS and metabolic plasticity. Inflammation reconfigured the distribution of macrophage metabolic profiles that remained heterogeneous. Notably, inflammation-derived nitric oxide finely tuned the distribution of macrophage energetic states. These findings challenge the view of homogenous metabolic activation and reveal a layer of metabolic diversity in tissue at steady state and during inflammation. The ability to stratify macrophage energy metabolic profiles with Met-Vision should help guide the development of metabolism-targeted therapies for inflammatory diseases, cancer, and metabolic disorders.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

The fact that complete resolution of disease by targeting key inflammatory cytokines remains challenging indicates a contribution of other immune cells to the pathogenesis. Here, we study the role of neutrophils in psoriasis, the first-line innate immune defender that is short-lived but mobile and infiltrate into various tissues. We found that upon psoriasis induction, skin-resident endothelial cells are activated to produce G-CSF which activates emergency granulopoiesis in bone marrow and induces cutaneous infiltration and accumulation of neutrophil that are functionally overactive. Depletion of neutrophils or blockage of psoriasis-driven granulopoiesis by respective neutralizing antibodies results in reducing cutaneous neutrophil burden and mitigating psoriasis pathogenesis. This mechanism might be conserved in human psoriasis as confirmed by public RNA-seq database. Our findings uncovered and detailed the pathological crosstalk between skin and BM in psoriatic inflammation, proposing a potential therapeutic approach targeting cross-organ communication.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

PLC-{gamma}1 enzyme activity is basally autoinhibited, and light-controlled membrane recruitment of wild-type (WT) PLC-{gamma}1 (OptoPLC-{gamma}1) in Plcg1-null fibroblasts does not trigger lipid hydrolysis, complicating efforts to isolate its contribution. Utilizing cancer-associated mutations to investigate the regulatory logic of PLC-{gamma}1, we demonstrate that the canonical hallmark of enzyme activity, phosphorylated Tyr783 (pTyr783), is not a proxy for activity level, but is rather a marker of dysregulated autoinhibition. Accordingly, OptoPLC-{gamma}1 with a deregulating mutation (P867R, S345F, or D1165H) exhibits elevated phosphorylation, and membrane localization of such is sufficient to activate substrate hydrolysis and concomitant motility responses. In particular, local recruitment of OptoPLC-{gamma}1 S345F polarizes cell motility on demand. This response is spatially dose-sensitive and only partially reduced by blocking canonical PLC-{gamma}1 signaling yet is lipase-dependent. Our findings reframe the interpretation of PLC-{gamma}1 regulation and demonstrate that local activation of PLC-{gamma}1 is sufficient to direct cell motility.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

We have previously identified a population of late-forming endothelial progenitor cells in zebrafish embryos (termed secondary vascular field, SVF), which emerge from the lateral plate mesoderm after 24 hpf stage, after blood circulation has been initiated. Here we investigate the functional role of SVF cells and the molecular mechanisms that govern the emergence of these SVF cells and their contribution to vasculature. We identified that the bHLH transcription factor Hand2 and Junctional Adhesion Molecule Jam2b are expressed in the SVF-forming region and are required for the emergence of SVF cells in zebrafish embryos. Time-lapse imaging and jam2b:Cre based lineage tracing showed that SVF cells serve as the major source of the intestinal vasculature, including the supraintestinal artery (SIA) and subintestinal vein (SIV), which are subsequently remodeled to provide the blood flow to many internal organs. To analyze the functional role of jam2b and a related jam2a gene in vascular development, we generated double maternal-zygotic jam2a; jam2b mutants, which display a greatly reduced number of SVF cells and show defects in the intestinal vasculature development. Further analysis showed that hand2 functions in the SVF-forming region upstream of jam2b and is required to induce expression of transcription factor etv2/etsrp, a known master regulator of vasculogenesis. In summary, our results identify new roles for Jam2 signaling and Hand2 function in the emergence of organ-specific vascular progenitors. The presence of similar progenitors in mammalian embryos suggests that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

It can also reveal how animals use vocal signals to navigate complex social interactions that might not be apparent in solitary or non-cooperative contexts. To our knowledge, experimental evidence for intentional vocal communication in controlled experiments has been demonstrated only in dolphins. Here, we investigate whether peach-fronted conures (Eupsittula aurea) can use vocal communication to coordinate behaviour in a cooperative task. We chose parrots due to their complex social systems, their vocal learning and mimicry skills, and their advanced cognitive abilities. We tested four individuals pairwise in all combinations in the loose string paradigm, which requires synchronization of the two individuals to retrieve a food reward by simultaneously pulling a string. To verify that the parrots used vocal communication to solve the task, we tested them first under three control conditions where visual information and simple behaviour sufficed to solve the tasks. We then compared their vocal behaviour in the control conditions with their vocal behaviour in a task without visual information. During performance of the latter task, the birds demonstrated significantly higher call rates and variability and specific associations between call types and trial outcome compared to the control conditions. After the performance of the task, the birds used vocal convergence more often after failed trials, potentially as a reconciliation mechanism. Our results indicate that peach-fronted conures can use vocalizations to coordinate the solving of a cooperative task, and that vocal convergence may serve as a bonding mechanism following unsuccessful cooperative efforts.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Most of these efforts have focused on native-like, yet still recombinantly assembled, nucleosomes that contain native DNA sequences. To date, no high-resolution structures of native human nucleosomes have been reported. Here we report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of native human nucleosomes isolated from HEK293 cells. The HEK293-NCP structure reveals that native human nucleosomes store 145 bp of DNA. Despite the DNA sequence diversity of native nucleosomes, we observe conserved nucleotides that support the idea of a nucleosome positioning code. In addition to these striking features of nucleosomal DNA, we note alternate conformations of several DNA contacting histone residues that hint at dynamics in the HEK293-NCP. To complement the HEK293-NCP structure, we provide a mass spectrometry analysis of histone modifications and variants present in the sample, which demonstrates that a typical HEK293-NCP is composed of canonical histones with N-terminal tails that are methylated at K9, K27 and/or K36 of histone H3.

We benchmarked this approach on the CASF-2016 and DUD-E datasets, analyzing pose quality, scoring accuracy, and screening performance. We find that competitive screening power can be achieved when generating and scoring as few as three poses and without pose refinement, which facilitates scalability.

However, despite their utility and wide application, these methods often return the results as an extensive and redundant list of gene sets, impeding interpretation and hypothesis generation. Moreover, network based information can provide additional biological context through functional interaction data, yet this is often overlooked by existing tools. Results: We developed GeDi, an R/Bioconductor package designed to streamline and standardize the interpretation of functional enrichment results. GeDi aggregates gene sets into biologically meaningful clusters using a suite of gene set distance metrics and clustering algorithms, aimed to reduce redundancy and improve clarity. GeDi also enables the integration of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data, through the implementation of a weighted distance metric, providing a richer biological context by capturing functional connectivity between pathways and their components. The package offers visualizations, aggregation, and automated reporting, and is available as both a stand-alone R-package and an interactive Shiny application.

During development, changes in body shape, muscle strength and physiological needs drive the continuous adjustment of locomotor patterns. How these changes are orchestrated in a flexible and adaptive manner remains unknown. We explore this question in Danionella cerebrum, a miniature freshwater fish that is emerging as an important vertebrate model in systems neuroscience. We identify a clear transition in locomotion, from continuous to burst-and-coast swimming occurring around 3 weeks of age. We demonstrate that this transition is an energy saving strategy, and that it reflects an instability in the sensorimotor process governing speed regulation. Rather than a preprogrammed developmental switch, it is therefore directly tied to the animal swimming strength. We confirmed this finding by manipulating sensory feedback in order to induce a similar transition at fixed developmental stages. Together, our results illustrate a dynamic interplay between body, brain, and environment during development, offering new insights into the principles governing adaptive locomotion.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

As a result, cryo-imaging reports obtained from non-trivial specimens including mammalian brain tissues are scarce and their physiological relevance remains to be determined. Here, we benchmarked plunge freezing with a variety of cryoprotectants that allow for mouse brain tissue vitrification of up to about 100 microns thick and across several brain regions while keeping the tissue functional. By utilizing the knock-in (KI) mouse model with fluorescent astrocytes we have performed targeted cryo-FIB/SEM volume-EM imaging as well as targeted high-resolution cryoET imaging. Prior to cryoET, we have successfully generated lamellae in a semi-automated fashion on both LMIS (liquid metal ion source)- and plasma-based cryo-FIB/SEM instrumentation thus expanding applicability of our pipeline. We visualized the NVU (neurovascular unit) and astrocytes processes and validated the physiological relevance of our outputs based on the morphology of the corresponding cellular and subcellular features.

However, the impact of the peripheral effects of leptin on systemic metabolism, especially in the context of obesity, remains unclear. To address this question, we selectively restored adipocyte leptin receptor (LEPR) expression in obese male and female LEPR conditional KO mice. Adipocyte LEPR restoration did not affect body weight but selectively increased brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass in male mice. This was associated with increased energy expenditure, smaller BAT adipocytes, lower triglycerides content, and increased markers of browning and lipolysis exclusively in males. Additionally, adipocyte LEPR restoration enhanced the expression of markers of endothelial cell and angiogenesis in male BAT, supporting increased local vascularization. Improved BAT function in males was also associated with lower HbA1c, better insulin sensitivity, reduced systolic blood pressure, decreased arterial stiffness and improved endothelial function. Lastly, adipocyte LEPR restoration lowered circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced tissue inflammation in the aorta and the heart, again in males only. These findings reveal a critical role for adipocyte leptin signaling in regulating BAT function and emphasize its importance in maintaining glycemic and cardiovascular health in males with obesity.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Participants deployed standardized traps across Vienna, enabling systematic sampling and active participation in research, which resulted in hundreds of fly collections, thousands of sampled fly specimens and new insights into the biodiversity and ecology of the collected fly species, demonstrating the feasibility of large-scale ecological research through public collaboration. To assess motivational drivers and perceived impacts of participation, we conducted an online survey (N=59) using the validated psychometric MORFEN-CS scale. Survey results revealed that nature conservation values and the intention to contribute to biodiversity conservation emerged as the strongest drivers of engagement, complemented by sociopolitical responsibility and citizen science-based motivations. Reported outcomes include knowledge gain (61%), more positive attitude toward study organisms (50%), and increased awareness of biodiversity (30%). Satisfaction was very high, with 85% rating their experience at the top of the scale and all participants expressing willingness to join future citizen science projects. Recruitment occurred mainly via social networks, and the sample of participants was highly educated, indicating limits to inclusivity and reach. Our findings demonstrate that citizen science can contribute to robust ecological data collection while gaining knowledge and awareness. Natural history museums, as trusted institutions, play a key role in facilitating such initiatives.

Extraintestinal Pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC), a leading cause of bloodstream and urinary tract infections (UTIs), are often resistant to one or more antibiotic classes. Previously, we identified a clonal group of ExPEC strains (P1A) that persisted over a 5-year period from 2012 to 2016 within a female patient who suffered from frequent recurrent UTIs. A subset of these isolates carried a plasmid-borne MDR island (Ec17R) harboring 17 resistance genes. Sampling of fecal and urine samples in 2019 indicated that the patient remained colonized with the P1A lineage, including Ec17R-positive strains, over 7 years after collection of the first P1A isolates in 2012. Highlighting the public health relevance and mobility of Ec17R, we found that Ec17R-like islands are globally distributed across diverse bacterial species from various environmental, agricultural, and clinical sources, including multiple ExPEC isolates from local pediatric patients. By applying clustering approaches and Bayesian network modeling to 267 pediatric ExPEC isolates, we found that functionally distinct classes of resistance genes (including several heavy metal resistance genes) have a high probability of co-occurrence, possibly reflecting carriage within MDR islands like Ec17R. Finally, we observed that strains within the P1A lineage are recalcitrant to antibiotics for which they have no known resistance mechanisms, suggesting that these pathogens have means beyond their formidable array of resistance genes to survive within a host for years despite the administration of numerous, robust antimicrobial treatments.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Studies indicate that the gut microbiota composition may be linked to certain temperament traits, defined as biologically-based differences in emotional reactivity and self-regulation. Here, we aimed to determine if the gut microbiota plays a role in temperament using an FMT approach. We focused on the temperament traits of exuberance, defined as positive reactivity, decreased behavioural inhibition, and high behavioural approach tendencies. Methods: Faeces from 2.5-year-old toddlers from FinnBrain Birth Cohort Study with high exuberance/approach or high behavioural inhibition in the LabTAB bubbles-episode was transferred to juvenile male Sprague Dawley rats (age 22/23 days). Behaviour of the rat recipients (n=53) was assessed using the novel non-social arena, novel social arena, hole board test for exploratory behaviour, social approach-avoidance test, and forced swim test. The faecal pellets collected from the rodents were analyzed with 16s rRNA sequencing and faecal samples from the sample of toddlers (which included the donors, n=176) were analysed using short-read metagenomic sequencing. The striatum and prefrontal cortex from the rodents' brains were analysed post-mortem using RNAseq. Results: Microbiome from toddlers with high exuberance traits induced increased exploratory behaviour compared to vehicle-controls and rats receiving faeces from inhibited toddlers. Locomotor activity, social, and depressive-like behaviour remained unaffected. We noted a downregulation of the dopamine synapse pathway within the striatum of the rats that received faeces from the inhibited trait donors compared with vehicle-controls. Faecal microbiota of rats receiving faeces from the same donor resembled more each other than rats from a different cage. Clostridium species AM29 11AC in toddler microbiome was positively related to exuberance, but there were no cross-sectional associations between faecal metabolites in the human sample.

We addressed this eco-evolutionary question in an open marine animal associated system, through two longitudinal samplings years apart in an oyster farm, obtaining >1,000 virulent phages and >600 Vibrio crassostreae strains. Surprisingly, lineages of phage and bacteria were very persistent, with some phages remaining strictly identical after four years. The phage-vibrio infection network remained modular with multiple lineages co-habitating within individual oysters for long periods of time. Seasonal restriction of V. crassostreae, overwintering in wild oysters, and limited viral decay may explain phage stability. Oysters also act as hotspots of activity of diverse mobile genetic element (MGE), hosting plasmids, prophages, phage-plasmids and entirely new classes of satellite-plasmids. Our findings demonstrate how nested ecological constraints can stabilize viral lineages: oysters house vibrio populations that escape host immunity, vibrios restrict phages via receptors and defenses, and satellites parasitize their cognate helper phages.

M.; Skotheim, J.", "abstract": "Cells typically regulate their size within a relatively tight range by coupling growth to the cell division cycle using a dedicated set of molecular mechanisms. In budding yeast, cells are born with a similar amount of the G1/S inhibitor protein Whi5 that is then diluted by growth throughout G1. As cells grow, Whi5 concentration decreases and cells become more likely to enter the cell cycle. Cells are born in G1 with similar amounts of Whi5 because of the size-independent (sub-scaling) expression of WHI5 mRNA during S/G2/M phases and the equal partitioning of Whi5 protein at division. While the latter is known to be achieved by association with chromatin before anaphase, the mechanism for the former is poorly understood. Through systematic mutations of the WHI5 promoter, we discovered that WHI5's core promoter region located -126 to -75 base pairs upstream of the start codon is responsible for sub-scaling expression. This sequence contains a repeating array of binding sites for the transcription factors Fkh1 and Fkh2. Mutation of any of these sites, deletion of either FKH1 or FKH2, or preventing Fkh1 or Fkh2 dimerization weakens the sub-scaling of WHI5 transcription. Taken together with structural predictions and a mathematical model of cooperative Fkh-DNA binding, we conclude that WHI5's sub-scaling transcription is regulated by a Fkh1/2 heteropolymer binding an array of sites in its core promoter.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

We resolved the origin of ligands and the cells that express their respective receptors for four major signaling pathways that have been previously implicated in bladder development, SHH, BMP, WNT and FGF. The transcription factor Odd-skipped related 1 is essential for mesenchymal differentiation during organogenesis of the foregut, kidney, limb, ureter and many others. We demonstrate that Osr1 is required for proper development of the bladder, with homozygous loss of Osr1 affecting all layers of the bladder including depletion of smooth muscle, loss of extracellular matrix, loss of suburothelial cells, and less stratified epithelia lacking intermediate and superficial cells. Transcripts within all four signaling pathways were largely decreased during cellular diversification in the bladder suggesting that Osr1 is a central mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal crosstalk during this crucial stage of bladder development.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Today, plague is still active in parts of Asia, Africa, and America. One of the hotly debated topics in plague studies is the geographic origins of the recurrent plague waves in Europe after the Black Death (1338-1353): Were they being repeatedly introduced from outside, or did they originate in domestic reservoirs? Here, we build upon recent work arguing for the existence of domestic reservoirs, by exploring a possibility that vertical transhumance by pastoralists could have been a conduit between temporary plague reservoirs and human population centers in Europe. We argue that aspects of pastoral movement and practice, including the utilization of marginal areas and of caves, account for some aspects of plague outbreaks both in the present and in the past. We support this hypothesis using historical sources from the Second Plague Pandemic in Central Europe, and suggest an association between recent and historical land use for pasture and plague outbreaks data.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

However, data on breeding success of this species in Germany are missing due to the low density and poor accessibility of nests and chance to disturb nesting efforts during direct nest searches. We therefore used two indirect methods to obtain data on breeding success. First, we analyzed field age ratios, i.e. the proportion of juveniles from Citizen Science data. We observed a marked decrease in observed fledglings from 1.28 in the years 1957-1989 to 0.44 in 1990-2009 and to 0.32 in 2010-2023. This suggests a sharp decline in breeding success. Very low juvenile numbers in July further suggest that first broods were especially affected. Second, nesting sites were determined from GPS data, and the breeding constancy was checked at these sites. Based on data from 32 GPS-marked birds representing 28 breeding pairs, we obtained values of maximum breeding success of 1.5 chicks per potential breeding pair at hatching and 0.7 chicks per potential breeding pair at fledging. This is an optimistic calculation for fledglings, as it assumes that two chicks per nest survive until fledging. Overall, these data highlight an urgent need to improve the habitat conditions in the breeding areas to conserve this once common species.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that incorporation of an imidazopyridinium (IP+) moiety into an MP significantly boosted passive membrane permeability, as measured by the parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA). In this study we report a detailed analysis of the entry of IP+ containing MPs into living cells. Chloroalkane penetration assay (CAPA) data show that IP+ MPs access the cytoplasm rapidly, often at rates approaching those of drug-like small molecules. Mechanistic studies, including live-cell imaging, ATP-depletion experiments, and organelle colocalization analyses, indicate that IP+ MPs traverse the plasma membrane primarily via passive diffusion, avoiding endosomal entrapment. IP+ MPs do not localize to mitochondria, as is the case for many positively charged molecules. We show that incorporation of an IP+ unit transforms a previously described membrane impermeable macrocyclic antagonist of the p53 MDM2 interaction into a bioactive inhibitor of MCF7 proliferation. Collectively, these results establish that IP+ incorporation is an effective strategy for the development of bioactive MPs targeting intracellular proteins.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP), a recently discovered photoenzyme, enables fatty acid conversion to alkanes/alkenes via excitation of an FAD cofactor, though its poor photostability and photoinactivation has hindered industrial applications. Here, we combine protein engineering approaches with biocatalytic and biophysical techniques, as well as computational chemistry, to demonstrate that additional active site cysteine residues can suppress oxygen-mediated inactivation processes that are driven by the FAD triplet-excited state. We identify a number of positions close to the FAD for cysteine residues that lead to a significant enhancement in activity as a result of an increase in the number of catalytic turnovers and improved photostability. The additional cysteine residues quench the triplet excited state of the FAD cofactor via a proposed proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism, resulting in lower levels of harmful reactive oxygen species.

Using AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as a model system, we uncover coordinated autophosphorylation cascades exhibiting kinetic hierarchies, with 1-S496 showing the highest kinetic efficiency. Allosteric ADaM-site activation bypasses canonical 1-T183 phosphorylation, enabling autophosphorylation even in activation-deficient mutants. Top-down MS sequencing identifies the predominant {beta}1 proteoform as S24/25+S108 double phosphorylation, a pattern linking extranuclear distribution with allosteric responsiveness. Phosphatase competition shows PP1A selectively removes activation-loop phosphorylation while autophosphorylation sites remain protected.

However, much remains to be understood about the precise mechanisms by which the osteocyte network regulates bone formation and bone resorption based on the propagation of biochemical signals emitted in response to mechanical stimulus. In this work, we propose a simple one-dimensional computational model of bone mechanical adaptation based on the propagation of signalling molecules through a dynamic osteocyte network. The osteocyte network is extended during bone formation, and reduced during bone resorption, which affects the generation and propagation of the signalling molecules to the bone surface. We explore how this osteocyte-based model of bone mechanosensation and mechanoresponse gives rise to effective Wolff's laws, in which overloaded bone is consolidated and underloaded bone is removed. We find that the pointwise addition and removal of osteocytes significantly affects signalling molecules propagating to the bone surface, which in turn affects the dynamics of bone formation and bone resorption. The explicit consideration of signal propagation through a dynamic network leads to new behaviours compared to previous models, such as partial bone recovery after an unloading and reloading cycle, and a minimum loading threshold below which all bone is resorbed when osteocytes are stimulated by mechanical stress (but not when they are stimulated by the strain energy density). While many extensions of this mathematical model are possible, it provides a first illustration of how the osteocyte network can act as a dynamic embedded control network for bone adaptation to mechanical loads.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, the extensive overlap in Fc-receptor binding sites on the Fc domain has impeded efforts to engineer antibodies with tailored, multi-receptor engagement profiles that can precisely control downstream immunity. Here we introduce a novel framework for Fc engineering that integrates protein engineering with deep learning to rationally predict and engineer antibody Fc function. Using a yeast-based, aglycosylated Fc display system, we performed deep mutational scanning across the entire human IgG1 Fc domain, allowing the rational design of a diverse combinatorial library of more than 108 Fc-variants. This library was sorted based on binding to a panel of eight canonical Fc-receptors, and the resulting populations were deep sequenced to generate a high-quality dataset comprising millions of unique Fc sequences annotated with their respective Fc-receptor binding profiles. Deep learning-based classifiers trained on this dataset accurately predicted Fc-receptor binding activity from Fc sequence across all Fc-receptors tested. We further developed FcGPT, a domain-specific autoregressive protein language model pre-trained on over three million unique Fc sequences, and refined by post-training through reinforcement learning with experimental feedback (RLXF) and synthetic verifiers.

We begin with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to systematically explore how the symmetry of the nucleocapsid core, together with the relative strengths of spike-core and spike-spike interactions, influences budding efficiency and the emergence of icosahedral particle symmetry. Building on these computational predictions, we perform site-directed mutagenesis on Chikungunya virus 181/25 and examine the consequences for particle assembly and budding in cultured cells, as well as the impact of these mutations during in-cellulo assembly. Our results reveal that canonical core-spike interactions, while necessary, are not sufficient for successful assembly.

Gaining insights into the molecular driving forces leading to fold switching behavior is crucial for the rational design of new metamorphic proteins based molecular switches, sensors and stimulus responsive nanomaterials.

However, it remains unclear whether this concept applies to the neuromuscular system in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (pwCOPD). This study aimed to challenge the loss of complexity hypothesis by assessing the regularity, as well as the steadiness and the accuracy, of force production during submaximal isometric contractions in pwCOPD compared to healthy individuals. Methods: Seventeen pwCOPD and seventeen age- and sex-matched healthy participants performed submaximal isometric contractions of the knee extensors at six target forces, ranging from 10 to 60% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Regularity of force signals was assessed using sample entropy (SampEn) and percentage of determinism (DET) from the recurrence quantification analysis. Steadiness and accuracy were quantified using the coefficient of variation (CV) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE), respectively. Results: PwCOPD exhibited 26.5% lower MVC than healthy individuals. Despite this muscular weakness, no significant main effect of group or interaction effect (group x contraction intensity) was observed for SampEn, DET, CV and RMSE, suggesting a preserved force control in pwCOPD at all assessed force levels. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the loss of complexity theory may not apply in moderate COPD, at least for the neuromuscular system. These findings suggest that neuromuscular alteration associated with COPD may not be sufficient to impair the complexity of force output, questioning the universality of the loss of complexity theory.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

D.; Wingfield, M. J.; Wilken, P. M.", "abstract": "Fungal species are typically either fully self-fertile or self-sterile, but some filamentous ascomycetes can commonly transition from self-fertility to self-sterility through unidirectional mating-type switching. In these fungi, the structure of the mating-type (MAT1) locus governs sexual behaviour: MAT-2 self-fertile individuals retain both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 genes, while MAT-1 self-sterile isolates lose MAT1-2 genes during switching. A third type of isolate morphology also occurs under laboratory conditions: these are self-sterile isolates which retain both MAT1-1 and MAT1-2, but are unable to switch mating type. These are commonly referred to as MAT-2 self-sterile isolates. Two of the mating-type (MAT) genes, one of which is deleted during switching, encode transcription factors known to regulate not only the sexual cycle but also genes unrelated to mating. To test how MAT1 structural variations affects gene expression, we studied Ceratocystis albifundus, a species that switches mating type. To minimise variability caused by intraspecific genetic differences, two self-sterile isolates (MAT-1 and MAT-2 self-steriles) were derived from the same MAT-2 self-fertile parent, making all three isolates genetically identical except at the MAT1 locus. Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed that the MAT-2 self-fertile, MAT-1 self-sterile and MAT-2 self-sterile isolates all exhibited distinct expression patterns, including differences in MAT genes, the pheromonereceptor pathway, and other genes not directly linked to mating. The results show that MAT1 locus structure influences gene expression more broadly than those only related to the sexual cycle.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

D.; Sevier, E.; Kobeck, E.; Cai, Y.; Agrawal, V.; Rathmacher, J. A.; Hemnes, A. R.", "abstract": "Background: Reactive oxygen species are increased across most pulmonary hypertension (PH) etiologies, resulting in increased reactive lipid dicarbonyls, which form protein adducts and impair mitochondrial function. We hypothesized that reducing reactive lipids would reduce right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and improve cardiac function by eliminating protein-lipid damage feedback loops. Methods: We used 2-hydroxybenzylamine (2-HOBA) to scavenge reactive lipids in three complimentary mouse models of PH: AKR-high fat diet (HFD, metabolic stress), LNAME-HFD (cardiometabolic syndrome), and pulmonary artery banding (PAB, load stress). Cardiac function was measured by echocardiography and catheterization. RV energy metabolism was determined by oxygraphy. Mass spectrometry analyzed lipids and ceramides; O-link and RNA-Seq evaluated proteomic and gene expression in lungs, RV, and LV. Results: Reducing reactive lipids with 2-HOBA resulted in a ~10% reduction in RVSP, reduced diastolic dysfunction, reduced plasma lipids and ceramides, and normalized RV fatty acid oxidation that was severely impaired in the AKR-HFD and PAB models. Proteomic and RNA changes in the lungs, RV, and LV suggested reduced oxidative damage and inflammatory signaling and altered developmental and actin organization signaling; these changes are plausibly associated with the improved adaptation. Some changes were sex specific, including a 4x higher cardiac fatty acid content in males than females. Conclusions: Reactive lipid scavenging improves cardiac metabolic and diastolic function and pulmonary vascular resistance through restoration of mitochondrial function and reduced oxidative protein damage. The magnitude of hemodynamic improvement combined with substantial diastolic function improvement suggests clinical potential, particularly for PH patients with metabolic comorbidities.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

G.; Nelson, C. P.; Webb, T. R.; Humphries, M.; Smith, G.; White, S. J.", "abstract": "Objective: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of mortality globally. Atherosclerosis develops at arterial sites exposed to disturbed, low, or oscillatory shear stress, while acute coronary syndromes-triggered by plaque rupture or erosion predominantly occurs in regions subjected to elevated shear stress. The response of endothelial cells to disturbed flow has received significant attention, however, the response to elevated flow is less well studied. We addressed this shortfall by providing a comprehensive analysis of mRNA, microRNA and proteome expression in primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs) cultured under different flow environments and identify novel changes in gene expression that may play a role in promoting both atherogenesis and plaque erosion. Approach and Results: We conducted a comprehensive multi-omic analysis of HCAECs cultured for 72 hours under oscillatory shear stress (OSS), physiological laminar shear stress (LSS), and elevated shear stress (ESS). Our results identified 2,175 shear-regulated genes, with 1,218 uniquely responsive to OSS and 665 to ESS. Both OSS and ESS induced significant changes in RNA isoform selection, affecting 580 and 848 genes respectively. Signalling pathways regulating CAD pathogenesis including HIPPO, TGF?/BMP, and IRF, showed altered RNA isoform selection which may influence plaque development and plaque erosion. 65% of LD-filtered CAD-associated genetic variants from two recent multi-population meta-analyses contained at least one OSS or ESS-regulated gene within 250Kb. Proteomic analysis identified 289 proteins differentially expressed under OSS and 171 under ESS, with notable discordance between mRNA and protein changes observed in 28.7% (OSS vs LSS) and 16.6% (ESS vs LSS) genes. Additionally, 40 shear-responsive microRNAs were identified, potentially contributing this discordance.

Despite its widespread occurrence, the outcomes of hybridization remain largely unpredictable within current evolutionary frameworks, making empirical studies key for identifying patterns and establishing principles underlying hybrid evolution. Here, we track the evolutionary trajectory of Blumeria graminis forma specialis triticale (B.g. triticale), or triticale powdery mildew, a pathogen that emerged recently through hybridization of two powdery mildew forms specialized on wheat (B.g. tritici) and rye (B.g. secalis). Using a genomic dataset of 652 isolates from the three formae speciales, we show that they persist as three isolated lineages. Results from our infection assays and sampling suggest that B.g. triticale is not well adapted to infect wheat under field conditions, indicating that isolation between B.g. tritici and B.g. triticale may be maintained by partial niche separation. We investigated the genomic changes following hybridization and found that at least a third of the hybrid genome is fixed for B.g. tritici ancestry in contemporary populations, and around 1% is fixed for the B.g. secalis ancestry. We identified several loci to be under recent positive selection in B.g. triticale, most of which coincide with known genes and regions of fixed or nearly fixed local ancestry. Overall, we highlight the role of ecological isolation in preventing gene flow between B.g. triticale and its parental lineages. We reveal the rapid stabilization of its genome after hybridization and show that some of these changes were likely shaped by selection.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

While previous approaches have benchmarked individual methods such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), rare variant burden testing, and quantitative trait locus (QTL)-informed Mendelian randomization, it remains unclear how best to integrate these signals for drug target discovery. Here, we compared gene-prioritization strategies across 30 complex traits, evaluating their ability to recover approved drug targets compiled into lenient and moderate gold-standard sets from six curated databases. Gene-level association scores from GWAS, expression QTL, protein QTL, and exome-based analyses were integrated using five unsupervised approaches. Predictive performance was assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and enrichment-based statistics. Across traits, GWAS alone ranked known drug targets on average ~652 ranks (3.42%) above random expectation, and the minimum-rank-based integration strategy provided an improvement of further ~558 positions (2.93%), achieving the best AUROC in 23 of 30 traits. When comparing genetic correlation and drug target overlap across trait pairs, we observed a significant positive association (r = 0.193; p = 5.46e-5), and cross-trait analyses further revealed that prioritization scores derived from related diseases could at times equal or even surpass a trait's own performance. For instance, coronary artery disease data improved the prediction of stroke targets (p = 0.004), while inflammatory bowel disease data enhanced the prioritization of chronic kidney disease targets (p = 0.014). Taken together, these results demonstrate that integrating complementary genetic signals through a minimum-rank-based framework, combined with information from genetically related traits, systematically strengthens drug target identification across complex diseases.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

F.; Frazier, W. J.; Kimball, M. G.; Lattin, C.

Therefore, understanding links between different behaviours is critical for understanding why animals sometimes fail to respond appropriately to environmental challenges. In this study, we assessed whether beak wiping, a stereotyped anxiety-linked behaviour where birds wipe their beaks on a perch in a ''windshield wiper'' motion, was correlated with another anxiety-linked behavior, neophobia towards novel objects presented with food, in captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We predicted that more neophobic sparrows would also exhibit more beak-wiping stereotypies. We analyzed 1 h long control videos (when sparrows were presented with a normal food dish only; n=54) from three previous neophobia studies to assess beak wiping frequency, mean beak wiping bout duration, and total bout duration. Sparrows' reluctance to feed in the presence of novel objects was significantly correlated with the mean duration of beak wiping bouts during control trials. We also found that simple enrichment (rubber perches, manzanita branch perches, and/or artificial pine branches) decreased both the frequency and duration of beak wiping. These findings suggest that neophobia and stereotypies may arise due to similar neuroendocrine mechanisms as part of a ''high anxiety'' behavioural syndrome. This work also highlights the importance of providing species-appropriate environmental enrichment to decrease the prevalence of stereotypic behaviours in captive songbirds.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

We analyzed reporter expression profiles from eight plaques and over 150 cells, reviewing, testing and applying methods of time-series analysis, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. We identified primary infections based on early reporter expression in isolated cells and secondary infections among their neighbors. Primary infected cells exhibited tightly clustered gene expression profiles, while secondary infected cells showed broader heterogeneity in the timing, intensity, and duration of reporter expression, without correspondence to their associated primary cells. This heterogeneity likely reflects a combination of factors, including noisy gene expression, viral genetic changes, and variation in local cellular environments.

QA is a NAD biosynthesis intermediate metabolized by the enzyme quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT). In this study, we investigated the role of QA in the AKI-to-CKD transition using experimental mouse models and clinical observations and leveraging multiple omics approaches. Systematic metabolomic profiling identified endogenous QA as one of the most significantly elevated metabolites following folic acid-(FA) induced injury. Exogenous QA exacerbated FA-induced kidney dysfunction. Conversely, aged mice deficient in QPRT showed worsened expression of kidney fibrosis markers even in absence of kidney injury, while younger littermates exhibited worsened induced kidney injury. Mice lacking QA-producing enzymes resisted experimental AKI and AKI-to-CKD progression. Multimodal spatial metabolomics analysis of human AKI kidney biopsies revealed QA accumulation in regions of inflammatory infiltration.

Previous work shows greater diversity than heretofore expected (1) and that also increases more quickly during a patient's clinical course than previously thought (1, 2). Rare subclones will harbor pre-existing resistance to any single agent and may cause medium to late term relapse (1), which may evolve further variants that have simultaneous resistance to non-cross resistant therapies (3, 4). We now present a probability distribution function (PDF) of the variant allele fraction (VAF) or prevalence of a rare subclone, derived from previous evolutionary theory (1, 2). We show that current clinical sequencing protocols fail to detect the vast majority of rare subclones. By the time of detection, simultaneous multiple resistance may evolve. We then apply the PDF to simulation of dynamic precision medicine (DPM) (3), an evolutionary guided precision medicine paradigm that attempts to proactively eliminate singly-resistant subclones before they evolve multiple resistance, with significant potential to extend survival. We show that the simulated benefit of DPM with perfect information is degraded by inability to detect rare subclones if they are assumed to be absent when undetectable. But this benefit is restored if the PDF is used to calculate the likelihood of the subclone being present below the level of detection and incorporated into the DPM simulation and therapy recommendations in a probabilistic fashion. Moreover, other common statistical distributions are less effective.

High-quality reads were obtained from 34 samples, allowing for the reconstruction of multiple haplotypes per region through haplotype phasing. The eDNA concentration required to achieve a 50% sequencing success was within a range easily attainable for common species. Phylogenetic analysis using 62 concatenated haplotypes (1,968 bp) obtained from each sample identified two clades and multiple regional subgroups, providing higher-resolution phylogeographic information than the previous study.

To address this question, we used a murine recombination-independent muscle fibre-specific doxycycline-inducible fluorescent myonuclear labelling approach, EdU stem cell fate tracking, two durations of muscle mechanical overload (MOV, 3 days and 7 days), and fluorescent histology. Our findings show that: 1) displaced myonuclei emerge early during MOV, 2) resident myonuclear movement occurs rapidly during MOV, and 3) the contribution of resident versus exogenous displaced myonuclei depends on MOV duration, fibre type, and fibre size.

We demonstrated that Near Infrared spectra measured on leaves evolve through processes unrelated with domestication, enabling its use as a control for sampling effects across species. Building on this, we developed a multivariate Phenotypic Divergence Index (mPDI) to rank species by the extent of phenotypic divergence under domestication. We found a high disjunction of wild and domestic phenotypic spaces in all species. Neither the mPDI nor the relative size of wild versus domestic multivariate phenotypic spaces was influenced by the domestication timing or mating system.

S.; Derda, R.", "abstract": "Glycan-binding proteins (GBP) are among the most difficult to drug targets. This deficiency delays clinical progress for therapeutically important GBPs. We employed bicyclic genetically encoded libraries (BiGELs), produced by chemical modification of phage-displayed libraries of peptides with two-fold symmetric linchpins, to discover inhibitors of therapeutically relevant Siglec-7:GD3 interactions. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis of panning of BiGEL against Siglec-7 yielded 815 candidates from which 23 hits yielded KD = 1-100 {micro}M as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) identified a subset of leads that disrupted the Siglec-7:GD3 interaction with IC50 = 3-300 {micro}M. Machine learning models trained on NGS datasets identified additional inhibitors with equivalent potency. Alanine scans of 8c (SWCRPATVNC, IC50 = 3.8 {micro}M) and 12c (SFCHYPTHVC, IC50 = 11 {micro}M), identified key residues as crucial for activity. Ring reshaping studies of compound 8c highlighted the critical role of bicyclic topology produced by analogue 46e (SAAAAAWCRPATVNC, IC50 = 9.5 {micro}M). Multivalent display of the lead bicycles alongside ~100 glycans in Liquid glycan Array (LiGA), made it possible to compare the binding of bicycles and glycans to Siglec-7 expressed on CHO, Jurkat, and Raji cells. LiGA assays confirmed binding of the bicycles to Siglec-7 but revealed considerable non-specific interactions with receptor-negative cells. Saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance (STD-NMR) revealed 46e binds to Siglec-7 at a site distinct from the V-Ig domain, suggesting it might inhibit binding of glycans to the glycan-binding site of Siglec-7 via an allosteric site. Together these results demonstrate that BiGEL enables the discovery of bicyclic peptides for undruggable Siglec targets but highlights future challenges in molecular discoveries that aim to identify small, non-carbohydrate inhibitors of GBPs.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}

A.; Yu, L.; Campbell, K. P.", "abstract": "Dystroglycan (DG), a transmembrane receptor crucial for tissue development and pathogen entry, harbors a glycan composed of xylose and glucuronic acid called matriglycan. Loss of matriglycan or reduction in its length affects DG function, causing dystroglycanopathies. However, the mechanism underlying matriglycan extension is unknown. Here, we show that a Golgi xylose kinase facilitates initiation of matriglycan synthesis by transiently adding a phosphate to the xylose of matriglycan primer. Matriglycan extends when the phosphate is removed from xylose by the N-terminal domain of dystroglycan (DGN). DGN has the DXDXT/V motif found in haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) domains of hydrolases, conditional mutations in which reduce matriglycan length and cause disease in mice. Our work reveals an unexpected glycan phosphatase function of DG in regulating matriglycan extension on itself.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Mutations in HOMEOBOX DOMAIN-2 improve grain protein content in wheat without significantly affecting grain yield and senescence", "doi": "10.1101/2025.10.10.681749", "authors": "Safdar, L. B.; Fisk, I. D.; Pasquariello, M.; Lale, A.; Searle, I. R.; Bhosale, R.; Foulkes, J.; Boden, S. A.", "abstract": "MicroRNA-resistant alleles of HOMEOBOX DOMAIN-2 (HB-2) were recently reported to improve grain protein content (GPC) in wheat by modifying vascular development in stems to increase amino acid distribution to grain. However, it is not known if these alleles increase GPC at the expense of other physiologically important traits, such as senescence and yield-component traits. Here, we evaluated the effects of mutations in HB-2 on grain yield and nitrogen (N)-use efficiency as well as senescence and plant architecture in multi-environment glasshouse and field experiments. In glasshouse experiments, the mutations in HB-2 moderately improved GPC irrespective of N supply and without accelerating senescence or decreasing grain number or weight compared to the wildtype. The trait analysis indicated mutant plants were more tolerant of N limitation in terms of above-ground N reduction compared to the wild type. The expression of all HB-2 homeologues increased in spikes at the lemma primordium stage in response to N limitation, indicating the later GPC increase could be a result of enhanced N sink strength determined during early development, rather than processes caused by direct changes in HB-2 expression in the grain. In field experiments, the introgression of HB-2 alleles into Australian elite spring wheat cultivars significantly improved GPC without compromising grain yield. The outcomes of this study support the introduction of miRNA-resistant HB-2 alleles, with a preference to HB-A2, into commercial wheat for improving grain quality without a yield penalty.", "date": "2025-10-11", "journal": ""}
