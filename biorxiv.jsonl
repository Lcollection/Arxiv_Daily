K.", "abstract": "Neural oscillations have been proposed to be involved in predictive processing, however less addressed in the multisensory context. In the present study, we recorded cortical activity using magnetoencephalography during an audiovisual serial prediction task in which participants had to acquire stimulus sequences and to monitor whether subsequent probe items complied with the sequence. In a given trial, either visual or auditory features of the bimodal stimuli were task-relevant. Task-related changes of power and coupling of neural oscillations were analyzed using a data-driven clustering approach. We observed prediction-related theta-band coupling in a network involving the cingulate, premotor, prefrontal, and superior temporal regions. The behavioral performance of participants varied as a function of the phase delay of the coupling between different regions in this network. Two additional clusters were detected in which beta power was stronger if the previous or the following stimuli were the same as the current one in the sequence. These clusters interacted with the theta-band prediction network through cross-frequency coupling. Our results offer novel insights into the multi-timescale neural dynamics underlying multisensory predictions, suggesting that oscillations in multiple frequency ranges, as well as coupling within and across frequencies, may be critical for multisensory sequence processing.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Here, the control process was operationalized in a drift diffusion model as the lowering of the decision threshold on difficult trials. Reanalyzing the data from this experiment, we establish alternative explanations for these findings. We show that the reported evidence for controlled threshold adjustments can be explained away by task confounds, time-dependent collapses in decision thresholds, and stimulus-driven dynamics in alternative decision frameworks. With regard to the individual study, our findings challenge the reported evidence for this new theory of motivated control.

S.", "abstract": "Deciphering the brain's structure-function relationship is key to understanding the neuronal mechanisms underlying perception and cognition. The cortical column, a vertical organization of neurons with similar functions, is a classic example of primate neocortex structure-function organization. While columns have been identified in primary sensory areas using parametric stimuli, their prevalence across higher-level cortex is debated, particularly regarding complex tuning in natural image space. However, a key hurdle in identifying columns is characterizing the complex, nonlinear tuning of neurons to high-dimensional sensory inputs. Building on prior findings of topological organization for features like color and orientation, we investigate functional clustering in macaque visual area V4 in non-parametric natural image space, using large-scale recordings and deep learning-based analysis. We combined linear probe recordings with deep learning methods to systematically characterize the tuning of >1,200 V4 neurons using in silico synthesis of most exciting images (MEIs), followed by in vivo verification. Single V4 neurons exhibited MEIs containing complex features, including textures and shapes, and even high-level attributes with eye-like appearance. Neurons recorded on the same silicon probe, inserted orthogonal to the cortical surface, often exhibited similarities in their spatial feature selectivity, suggesting a degree of functional organization along the cortical depth. We quantified MEI similarity using human psychophysics and distances in a contrastive learning-derived embedding space. Moreover, the selectivity of the V4 neuronal population showed evidence of clustering into functional groups of shared feature selectivity. These functional groups showed parallels with the feature maps of units in artificial vision systems, suggesting potential shared encoding strategies. These results demonstrate the feasibility and scalability of deep learning-based functional characterization of neuronal selectivity in naturalistic visual contexts, offering a framework for quantitatively mapping cortical organization across multiple levels of the visual hierarchy.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

To systematically uncover the cellular factors controlling the accumulation of tau aggregates in human neurons, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPRi-based modifier screen in iPSC-derived neurons. The screen uncovered expected pathways, including autophagy, but also unexpected pathways, including UFMylation and GPI anchor synthesis, that control tau oligomer levels. We discover that the E3 ubiquitin ligase CUL5-SOCS4 is a potent modifier of tau levels in human neurons, ubiquitinates tau, and is correlated with resilience to tauopathies in human disease. Disruption of mitochondrial function promotes proteasomal misprocessing of tau, which generates tau proteolytic fragments like those in disease and changes tau aggregation in vitro.

Because BMP resides on and regulates the biogenesis of endolysosomal intralumenal membranes that become extracellular vesicles (EVs) upon release, we hypothesized that elevated urinary BMP may be driven by increased exocytosis of BMP-enriched EVs. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed BMP metabolism and EV-associated release of BMP in wild type (WT) and R1441G LRRK2-expressing mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. Using immunofluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy we detected structural alterations in endolysosomes and antibody-accessible BMP pool, indicating that mutant LRRK2 affects endolysosomal homeostasis. Biochemical analyses of isolated EV fractions confirmed the effect on endolysosomes by showing an increase in LAMP2-positive EVs in mutant cells, which was partially restored by LRRK2 kinase inhibition but further augmented, albeit to a more variable extent, by GCase inhibition. Using mass spectrometry, we detected an overall increase in total di-22:6-BMP and total di-18:1-BMP in cell lysates from mutant LRRK2 MEFs compared to WT cells. Inhibition of LRRK2 kinase partially restored cellular BMP levels, whereas inhibition of GCase further increased the BMP content. In isolated EVs from LRRK2 mutant cells, LRRK2 inhibition decreased BMP content whereas GCase inhibition tended to increase it. Using metabolic labeling experiments, we demonstrated that the increase in cellular BMP content is not due to an increase in BMP synthesis, even though we observed an increase in BMP synthesizing enzyme, CLN5, in LRRK2 mutant MEFs and patient-derived fibroblasts. Finally, pharmacological modulation of EV release and live total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of endolysosomal exocytosis in human G2019S LRRK2 fibroblasts, further confirmed that BMP release is associated with EV secretion. Together, these results establish LRRK2 as a regulator of BMP levels in cells and its release through EVs and suggest that GCase activity further modulates this process in LRRK2 mutant cells. Mechanistic insights from these studies have implications for the potential use of BMP-positive EVs as a biomarker for Parkinsons disease and associated treatments.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

A.; Freitag, F.; McClary, T.; Wernet, M. F.; Linneweber, G. A.", "abstract": "Over the past decade, several studies have demonstrated that idiosyncratic animal behaviors remain consistent over long time periods. The consistency of individually variable behaviors over time is often referred to as an animal's individuality, or if consisting of multiple traits personality. However, most experimental studies have focused on individuality in a single, well-defined environmental context, whereas it is well-established from population studies that animal behavior is highly context-dependent. The \"person-situation debate\" in humans and decades of observations of animal individuality under intrinsically variable natural conditions raise the question of whether and to what extent animal behavior remains consistent across different situations, such as changing environmental contexts. For instance, one individual might be generally more visually guided than another, or rely only on one particular visual cue, or even on this very cue only in a specific environmental context. Here, we use a combination of both well-established and novel behavioral assays to demonstrate the relationship between individual behavior and variable environmental context under tightly controlled laboratory conditions in the model system Drosophila melanogaster. The consistency of three individual traits (termed exploration, attention, and anxiety) was investigated under changing environmental contexts (temperature, visual cues, arena shape), in both walking and flying flies. We find that individuality is highly context-dependent, but even under the most extreme environmental alterations tested, consistency of behavioral individuality always persisted in at least one of the traits. Furthermore, our quantification reveals a hierarchical order of environmental features influencing individuality. We confirmed this hierarchy using a generalized linear model and a hierarchical linear mixed model. In summary, our work demonstrates that, similar to humans, fly individuality persists across different contexts (albeit worse than across time), and individual differences shape behavior across variable environments. The presence of consistency across situations in flies makes the underlying developmental and functional mechanisms amenable to genetic dissection.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

We describe here a CRISPRi platform directed toward identifying essential gene hypomorphs that preferentially change resistance to the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin in RND pump overproducers. An sgRNA library including single and double nucleotide mutations directed against essential genes of A. baumannii was constructed and introduced into multiple strain backgrounds, allowing strain-specific, titratable knockdown efficiencies to be analyzed. Other than NusG depletions, there were few candidates in the absence of drug treatment that showed lowered fitness specifically in strains overexpressing the RND efflux pumps AdeAB, AdeIJK, or AdeFGH. In the presence of ciprofloxacin, the hypomorphs that caused hypersensitivity were predicted to result in outer membrane dysfunction, with the AdeFGH overproducer appearing particularly sensitive to such disruptions. Increased ciprofloxacin susceptibility in two pump hyper-expressers was observed after depletions of a monovalent cation-proton antiporter protein and a nucleoid-associated protein, the latter of which was necessary for pump hyper-activation. On the other hand, depletions of translation-associated proteins as well as components of the proton-pumping ATP synthase resulted in fitness benefits in the presence of the drug for at least two pump-overproducing strains. Therefore, pump overproduction exacerbated stress caused by defective outer membrane integrity, while the efficacy of drug resistance in efflux pump overproducers was enhanced by slowed translation or defects in the proton-pumping ATP synthase.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate with simulations of Kirchhoff rods driven internally by active bending moments that a single elastohydrodynamic instability universally explains transitions between planar, quasiplanar, helical, and complex beating patterns due to changes in either the internal forcing, flagellar stiffness and length, or due to changes in the hydrodynamic resistance, either due to the viscosity of the ambient medium or the presence of a plane wall. The beat patterns and transitions are comparable to those exhibited by bull sperm and sea urchin sperm in our experiments and elsewhere. Our results point to a general model that can describe flagellar and ciliary beating across all species.

HO-1 catabolizes heme, releasing ferrous iron, a key driver of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. We observed that colonic epithelial HO-1 is induced during colitis and tumorigenesis. We also found that HO-1 is upregulated in ferroptosis-inducing conditions in murine and human colonic epithelial organoids, and correlated with lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis markers in colonic tumors. In colonic epithelial organoids exposed to heme, deletion of Hmox1 amplified a compensatory oxidative stress and detoxification transcriptional program, likely reflecting unresolved oxidative and non-oxidative toxicity from heme. In vivo, epithelial HO-1 deficient mice developed significantly fewer and smaller tumors compared to littermate controls in a colitis-associated tumorigenesis model, despite similar inflammatory injury. Tumors from knockout mice exhibited reduced iron levels, decreased lipid peroxidation, lower oxidative DNA damage, and decreased proliferation. Single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor epithelial cells revealed a shift from a proliferative to a stress-adaptive program with loss of HO-1.

The leaching process is time-dependent and influenced by various environmental factors, leading to fluctuation in leachate toxicity. In this study, we quantified the temporal dynamics of leachate toxicity using the dose-response model. Meanwhile, to simulate weathering conditions, TWPs were exposed to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and elevated temperature. The results indicated that the leachate toxicity over time fitted a biphasic pattern, with an initial increase followed by a decrease, peaking at the 11th day. The toxicity fluctuation cannot be characterized by any single component, but rather leachate should be considered as an integral whole aligning with a typical hormesis dose-response curve. High temperature of road surface increased leachate toxicity by 66%, due to elevated concentrations of 67 identified organic compounds. UV irradiation, however, mitigated this effect, acting as antagonism. These findings underline the seasonal and spatial heterogeneity in leachate toxicity.

However, although single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and high-resolution imaging have been extensively applied to characterize such in vitro embryo models, a paucity of measurements of protein dynamics and regulation leaves a major gap in our understanding. Here, we sought to address this by applying quantitative proteomics to human and mouse gastruloids at four key stages of their differentiation (naive ESCs, primed ESCs, early gastruloids, late gastruloids). To the resulting data, we perform network analysis to map the dynamics of expression of macromolecular protein complexes and biochemical pathways, including identifying cooperative proteins that associate with them. With matched RNA-seq and phosphosite data from these same stages, we investigate pathway-, stage- and species-specific aspects of translational and post-translational regulation, e.g. finding peri-gastrulation stages of human and mice to be discordant with respect to the mitochondrial transcriptome vs. proteome, and nominating novel kinase-substrate relationships based on phosphosite dynamics. Finally, we leverage correlated dynamics to identify conserved protein networks centered around congenital disease genes.

A loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) occurs in most solid tumors in males and is often associated with worse survival, suggesting that LOY may give tumor cells a growth or survival advantage. We here use an expression-based continuous measure of LOY that allows us to investigate LOY in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) using both bulk and single-cell expression data. We find evidence suggesting that LOY affects the tumor immune environment by altering cancer/testis antigen expression and consequently facilitating tumor immune evasion, also reflected in inferred gene regulatory networks. In immunotherapy data, we further show that LOY and changes in expression of particular cancer/testis antigens are associated with response to pembrolizumab treatment and outcome. This computational study provides new insights into the mechanisms behind LOY in LUAD and a powerful biomarker for predicting immunotherapy response in LUAD tumors in males.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

However, regulatory elements, substrate proteins, and epigenetic functions of Kacac are not yet fully understood, hindering further in-depth understanding of acetoacetate modulated (patho)physiological processes. Here, we created a chemo-immunological approach for reliable detection of Kacac, and demonstrated that acetoacetate serves as the primary precursor for histone Kacac. We report the enzymatic addition of the Kacac mark by the acyltransferases GCN5, p300, and PCAF, and its removal by deacetylase HDAC3. Furthermore, we establish acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (AACS) as a key regulator of cellular Kacac levels. A comprehensive proteomic analysis has identified 139 Kacac sites on 85 human proteins. Bioinformatics analysis of Kacac substrates and RNA-seq data reveal the broad impacts of Kacac on multifaceted cellular processes.

While local oscillatory mechanisms are known to support timing, less is understood about how large-scale functional brain networks dynamically coordinate predictive processes. In particular, it remains unclear how functional connectivity (FC) - the integration of information into network hubs - differs during expectation formation (post-cue) versus outcome evaluation (post-target), and how this varies across levels of predictability. To investigate this, we recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) while participants performed a cued auditory target-detection task with varying temporal predictability (80% and 50%). Event-related potential (ERP) results revealed that implicit temporal predictability primarily modulated later evaluative processes (P3b, frontal negativity), rather than early sensory components, consistent with context updating under uncertainty. FC was analyzed using a data-driven approach based on Normalized Directed Transfer Entropy (NDTE) applied to EEG difference waveforms between high- and low-predictability conditions. Connectivity was examined separately for the post-cue and post-target periods to distinguish prediction and evaluation phases. Behaviorally, higher temporal predictability facilitated faster reaction times.

PCR amplification is affected by factors such as binding dynamics and primer-template interactions. This study aims to reduce the time and cost of the experiment by predicting PCR outcomes based on these factors. To achieve this, we first identify the most stable binding sites for each primer-template pair by calculating the Gibbs free energy. Then, we propose a unique labelling strategy that captures primer-template interactions in the binding sites by analyzing match and mismatch positions. We categorize a set of English words into two semantically distinct groups: one for match positions and another for mismatch positions. Words within each group have a higher cosine similarity to one another than to words in the opposing group. We assign the corresponding word to each base pair based on whether it is a match or a mismatch. The labelled sequence is then tokenized with BERT, serving as input to an CNN-BiLSTM model. Achieving 84.8% accuracy, this approach outperforms prior methods and pioneers BERT based analysis in primer-template bindings. Crucially, the model also demonstrates significantly better sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) compared to prior work, indicating a more robust capability to correctly distinguish both successful and failed PCR outcomes, which is vital for reliable experimental prediction.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

We developed five behavioral models using arrangement tasks: two models reflecting behavioral judgments of the purpose (transitivity) and the social content (sociality) of the actions depicted in the video stimuli; and three models reflecting behavioral judgments of the visual content (people, objects, and scene) depicted in still frames of the stimuli. We evaluated how well these models predict neural representational geometry and tested them against semantic models based on verb and nonverb embeddings and visual models based on gaze and motion energy. Our results revealed that behavioral models of action meaning/purpose (transitivity, sociality) better reflect neural representational geometry than behavioral models of object, person, and scene features, as well as semantic and visual models throughout much of cortex. The sociality and transitivity models captured a large portion of unique variance throughout the action observation network, extending into regions not typically associated with action perception, like ventral temporal cortex. Overall, these findings expand our understanding of the action observation network and indicate that the social content and purpose of observed actions are predominant in cortical representation.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

In this setting, mutations accumulate via a compound Poisson process, capturing both visible and hidden cell divisions within the reconstructed phylogenetic tree. We present a computationally efficient dynamic programming algorithm to compute the likelihood based on tree topologies with associated mutations, integrating over latent variables such as branch durations and unobserved cell divisions.

This neuron-glia interaction requires an intricate coordination of glial growth and differentiation. How this is controlled molecularly is largely unknown. At the example of Drosophila larval nerves, we show that glial growth, that occurs without any cell division, is initially triggered by the FGF-receptor tyrosine kinase Heartless (Htl). In a screen for genes acting downstream of activated FGF-receptor, we identified the large membrane protein Uninflatable (Uif), which supports the growth of excessive plasma membrane domains but does not support glial axon wrapping. Uif is also known to inhibit Notch. Surprisingly, we find that Notch signaling is required in postmitotic wrapping glia. While compromised Notch signaling results in a reduced wrapping efficiency, gain of Notch activity in wrapping glia leads to a hyperwrapping phenotype. Thus, Notch signaling is both necessary and sufficient for glial wrapping in Drosophila larvae. In addition, Notch suppresses both uif and htl function and thus stabilizes the switch between glial growth and glial axon wrapping. Given the general conservation of signaling mechanisms controlling glia development in mice and flies, similar mechanisms may act in the mammalian nervous system to control final glial differentiation.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

By leveraging optogenetic control of the Wnt signaling pathway in both HEK293T cells and H9 human embryonic stem cells, we systematically map the relationship between signal frequency and downstream pathway activation. We find that cells exhibit a minimal response to Wnt at certain frequencies, a behavior we term anti-resonance. We developed both detailed biochemical and simplified hidden variable models that explain how anti-resonance emerges from the interplay between fast and slow pathway dynamics. Remarkably, we find that frequency directly influences cell fate decisions involved in human gastrulation; signals delivered at anti-resonant frequencies result in dramatically reduced mesoderm differentiation.

Depending on the primary objective - such as maximizing carbon sequestration or protecting threatened species - and within the boundaries of budget constraints, different spatial priorities have been identified at global and regional scales. Funding mechanisms to support such work comprise public sources, philanthropy, and the private sector, including the sales of carbon and biodiversity credits. However, effectively exploring tradeoffs among restoration objectives and estimating the price of biodiversity and carbon credits to design financially viable projects remain challenging. Here we harness the power of artificial intelligence in our software CAPTAIN, which we further develop to identify spatial priorities for ecological restoration that maximize multiple objectives at once and to allow a robust evaluation of biodiversity and climate outcomes. We find through a series of simulations that even low-to-moderate consideration of biodiversity in restoration projects leads to the selection of restored areas that disproportionately improve the conservation of threatened species, while resulting in a relatively smaller total amount of carbon captured. We propose a data-driven valuation of biodiversity credits in relation to carbon credits, enabling the design of a bundled financial model that could support restoration efforts even in areas previously excluded for economic reasons.

Among these are the furanolides, a structurally diverse class of compounds first discovered in the 1980s and 1990s. Furanolides are characterised by a {gamma}-butyrolactone core bearing aromatic or aliphatic substituents at the - and {beta}-positions and an aromatic substituent at the {gamma}-position. Recent advances in understanding the genetic basis of furanolide biosynthesis has enabled genome mining approaches to discover related cryptic furanolide biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). In this work, we identified and cloned a cryptic BGC (15.5 kb) from Nodularia sp. NIES-3585 using the Direct Pathway Cloning (DiPaC) strategy and heterologously expressed it in E. coli BAP1. Through isolation and structural elucidation, we characterized the known compound maculalactone B and discovered two novel analogues: maculalactone N, featuring a 4-hydroxybenzyl substituent at the -position, and furanolide I, bearing an aliphatic group derived from 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoic acid at the {beta}-position. Application of Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) analysis of high-resolution LCMS data enabled the identification of 20 maculalactone-related molecules. Structural analysis based on manual annotation of MS/MS fragment ions suggests the maculalactones consistently possess aromatic substituents at the - and {gamma}-substituents with various hydroxylation patterns, whilst the {beta}-substituent displays remarkable diversity, accommodating aromatic, aliphatic, or indole moieties. Additionally, several analogues exhibited hydroxylation of the furanolide ring itself.

In the lung, it is found in macrophages, bronchial and epithelial alveolar cells type 2, leading to pulmonary emphysema. Despite extensive research, the precise mechanism underlying the formation of 1-antitrypsin inclusion bodies remain elusive. In this study, we combine equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the intricate process of 1-antitrypsin condensate formation and maturation. Our mechanistic model explains cluster accumulation--specifically the onset of this pathogenesis--through the emergence of phase-separated liquid-like protein droplets, which subsequently undergo inter-protein {beta}-sheet transitions between misfolded variants, resulting in solid-like clusters. We find that this mechanism only applies to the misfolded variant, Z-1-antitrypsin, which phase-separates driven by its disordered C-terminus. In contrast, the native protein, M-1-antitrypsin, shows much lower propensity to phase-separate and form kinetically trapped aggregates. Furthermore, we explore how Z-1-antitrypsin exhibits an increased capacity to form condensates near external walls with different types of interactions. Such conditions can be similar to those found within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, where phase separation and hardening take place. Overall, our results shed light on the molecular basis of 1-antitrypsin-related disorders and provide valuable microscopic insights for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting protein misfolding and aggregation-related disorders.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

This capability is at the heart of OFCs proposed role in a network responsible for cognitive mapping, and its loss can explain many deficits associated with OFC damage or inactivation. Substance use disorder is defined by behaviors that share much in common with these deficits, such as an inability to modify learned behaviors in the face of new information about undesired consequences. One explanation for this similarity would be if addictive drugs impacted the ability of OFC to recognize underlying similarities, hidden states, that allow information learned in one setting to be used in another. To explore this possibility, we trained rats to self-administer cocaine and then recorded single unit activity in lateral OFC as these rats performed in an odor sequence task consisting of unique and shared positions. In well-trained controls, we observed chance decoding of sequence at shared positions and near chance decoding even at unique positions, reflecting the irrelevance of distinguishing these positions in the task. By contrast, in cocaine-experienced rats, decoding remained significantly elevated, particularly at the positions that had superficial sensory differences that were collapsed in controls across learning. These neural differences were accompanied by increases in behavioral variability at these positions. A tensor component analysis showed that this effect of reduced generalization after cocaine use also extended across positions in the sequences.

In two within-subject sessions, 30 healthy participants underwent the standard M1-PAS protocols inducing LTP (PASLTP) and LTD (PASLTD) while measuring motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) and TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) from M1 stimulation before, immediately after, and 30 minutes from the end of the PAS, applied both at supra- (i.e., 110%) and sub- (i.e., 90%) resting motor threshold intensities. Besides replicating MEPs enhancement and inhibition after PASLTP and PASLTD, our results showed that the P30 and N100 M1-TEPs components were significantly modulated immediately following PASLTP and PASLTD administration. These effects were detectable only in suprathreshold conditions, suggesting that M1 subthreshold stimulation could not be optimal for tracking cortical effects of PAS. Furthermore, exploratory analyses showed that P60 amplitude at baseline successfully predicted the magnitude of P30 modulations after PASLTP administration. Our findings provide compelling evidence about the specificity of early TEP components in reflecting changes in M1 reactivity underpinning PAS effects and associative plasticity induction within the motor system. From a broader perspective, our study fosters evidence about using TMS-EEG biomarkers to track complex plastic changes induced in the human brain, exploiting neuromodulatory non-invasive brain stimulation protocols based on associative mechanisms, like PAS.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

By integrating transcriptomic (microarray data and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing [sn-RNA] data), molecular imaging, and neuroimaging datasets, we present converging evidence that the spatial distribution of diverse cell types, neurotransmitter systems, and mitochondrial phenotypes are systematically aligned with intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs)-the macroscale scaffolding of brain function. These associations extend beyond local correspondence to reflect network-level structure: inter-ICN similarity networks derived from cellular and molecular profiles significantly recapitulate both static and dynamic patterns of functional network connectivity (FNC), mirroring the established division of ICNs into canonical functional domains. Importantly, these cellular and molecular profiles not only co-localize with ICNs and FNC but also appear to support their role as intermediaries linking microscale biological substrates to cognitive function. Mediation analyses reveal that specific ICNs statistically mediate the relationship between microscale cell-type architecture and domain-specific cognitive and behavioral processes. Moreover, dynamic FNC, particularly in specific transient states, captures the mediating pathways linking cell-type and neurotransmitter similarity networks to cognitive network organization. Taken together, our findings suggest that the brain's functional architecture is systematically aligned with cellular and molecular organization, which may act as a biological constraint guiding functional network formation and shaping the neural basis of cognition.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

One such mechanism in rotifers is a block on sexual reproduction that extends across multiple asexual generations after emergence from diapause.

Here, we develop a model of cyclically parthenogenic rotifer populations with a novel formulation of a \"mictic block\" that prevents sexual reproduction by females that are not sufficiently distant, genealogically, from a stem ancestor that was produced sexually. We find that mictic blocks are indeed adaptive but that the most successful phenotypes have shorter blocks than previously reported and that the success of different delay phenotypes is highly dependent on the duration of the growing season. For a fixed environmental regime, a stable polymorphism is possible, wherein a phenotype with a longer block performs better in years with an average-length growing season, and a phenotype with a shorter block and lower mixis ratio performs better in years with an \"extreme\" growing season, whether short or long.

On average, more than half of the carbon atoms in a terpene scaffold undergo a change in connectivity or configuration during these enzymatic cascades. Understanding TPS reaction mechanisms remains challenging, often requiring intricate computational modeling and isotopic labelling studies. Moreover, the relationship between TPS sequence and catalytic function is difficult to decipher, while data-driven approaches remain limited due to a lack of comprehensive, high-quality data sources.

The specific tryptophan- derived metabolites responsible for such toxicity, however, remain incompletely characterized. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying tryptophan-induced toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We observe that tryptophan concentrations of 1 mM or higher are highly toxic to C. elegans, blocking egg hatching. Notably, supplementation with various sugars, including glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose, rhamnose, and lactose, alleviates this toxicity. Genetic analyses reveal that host tryptophan metabolism is dispensable for the observed effects. Instead, bacterial metabolism, particularly the conversion of tryptophan to indole, is essential for mediating toxicity. Bacterial strains deficient in indole production abolished tryptophan-induced toxicity, and all sugars that conferred protection also suppressed bacterial indole synthesis.

Even during sleep, respiration rhythms modulate sleep-related oscillations. While the basal ganglia are known to play roles in both sleep and respiratory regulation, their interaction with respiration rhythms remains poorly understood. Here, we examined respiration-neural couplings in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and the primary motor cortex (M1) across multiple states in male and female mice, including non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, quiet wakefulness, and anesthesia. Simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFPs) from M1 and SNr along with diaphragm muscle activities revealed state-dependent, region specific patterns of respiration-neural coupling. Coupling strength in both SNr and M1 was attenuated during NREM sleep compared to REM sleep and quiet wakefulness. However, under ketamine/xylazine anesthesia, coupling was markedly enhanced in the SNr, but not in M1, indicating region-specific sensitivity to arousal and anesthesia state. Notably, respiration-neural coupling was systematically related to delta sub-band power; coupling strength was reduced with increased slow delta (0.5-2 Hz) and decreased fast delta (2.5-4 Hz) powers. In addition, slow delta was associated with SNr-M1 synchronization, suggesting that inter-regional communication during deep sleep may suppress respiration locking. Together, these findings highlight dynamic, state-dependent modulation of respiration-neural couplings in cortico-basal ganglia circuits, underscoring its potential role in coordinating body-brain interactions during sleep and anesthesia.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

These patterns are proposed to act as \"inhibitory stencils\" that constrain where sensory-related information (the \"content\" of cognition) can be expressed in spiking activity. Here, we provide a comprehensive empirical test of Spatial Computing using multi-electrode recordings from the lateral prefrontal cortex in non-human primates performing a range of cognitive tasks (object working memory, sequence working memory, categorization). We found that alpha/beta oscillations encoded task-related information, were organized into spatial patterns that changed with task conditions, and inversely correlated with the spatial expression of sensory-related spiking activity. Furthermore, we found that alpha/beta oscillations reflected misattributions of task conditions and correlated with subjects' trial-by-trial decisions. These findings validate core predictions of Spatial Computing suggesting that oscillatory dynamics not only gate information in time but also shape where in the cortex cognitive content is represented.

We present a novel framework from statistical physics -- Maximum Caliber -- to characterize the temporal dynamics of complex ecological systems in spatially extended landscapes and infer parameters from empirical data. As an extension of Maximum Entropy modeling, Maximum Caliber aims at modeling the probability of possible trajectories of a stochastic system, rather than focusing on system states. We demonstrate the ability of the Maximum Caliber framework to capture ecological processes ranging from near- to far from- equilibrium, using an array of species interaction motifs including random interactions, apparent competition, intraguild predation, and non-transitive competition, along with dispersal among multiple patches. For spatio-temporal data of species occupancy in a metacommunity, the parameters of a Maximum Caliber model can be estimated through a simple logistic regression to reveal migration rates between patches, interactions between species, and local environmental suitabilities. We test the accuracy of the method over a range of system sizes and time periods, and find that these parameters can be estimated without bias. We introduce ``entropy production'' as a measure of irreversibility in system dynamics, and use ``pseudo-$R^2$'' to characterize predictability of future states. We show that our model can predict the dynamics of metacommunities that are far from equilibrium. The capacity to estimate basic parameters of dynamical metacommunity models from spatio-temporal data represents an important breakthrough for the study of metacommunities with application to practical problems in conservation and restoration ecology.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

In this study, we developed mathematical models and computer applications to investigate one- and two-allele models of habitat-preference barriers in sympatric populations under disruptive ecological selection. We examined two spatial arrangements: an open-space model inspired by sympatric cichlid fishes that meet in open water with niche habitats that are small relative to lake size, and a no-open-space model inspired by sympatric hawthorn and apple maggot flies that move directly between trees without lingering in midair. Next, we examined coupling between habitat-preference barriers and a two-allele mating-bias barrier developed in a prior study to analyze how their invasion and coupling dynamics could lead to stronger RI. Our findings confirm that habitat preference is an independent mechanism capable of establishing initial premating barriers in sympatric speciation. Moreover, it can couple with additional barriers, such as those based on mating-trait discrimination, to enhance overall RI. Because habitat preference is an adaptive barrier mechanism, its invasion and coupling are driven by selection pressures arising from maladaptive hybrid loss, and it is readily reversed when disruptive ecological selection weakens. The one-allele model is easier to evolve than the two-allele model because it is immune to recombination by gene flow. Habitat-preference barriers can facilitate the emergence of mating-bias barriers. Open-space systems provide fewer opportunities for inter-niche encounters and tend to result in stronger RI compared to no-open-space systems. By elucidating the habitat-preference mechanism, our study reinforces the important role of habitat-preference barriers in sympatric speciation. It also provides insights into a wide range of premating isolating mechanisms--temporal, behavioral, and mechanical--that function similarly by reducing mating encounters.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

These epilines were built in parallel following (epi +), or not (epi -), an initial genistein ingestion in the ancestors' diet and were maintained to harbour a similar genetic structure. Linear models were fitted to extract the fraction of variance allocated to multiple factors such as family, sex and epiline. The latter was found to be significantly associated with body weight.

Popular for incorporating phylogenetic relationships, UniFrac distances currently default to relative abundance and therefore omit important variation in microbial abundances. As quantifying absolute abundance becomes more accessible, integrating this information into {beta}-diversity analyses is essential. Here, we introduce Absolute UniFrac ((UA)), a variant of Weighted UniFrac that incorporates absolute abundances. Using simulations and a reanalysis of four 16S rRNA metabarcoding datasets (from a nuclear reactor cooling tank, the mouse gut, a freshwater lake, and the peanut rhizospere), we demonstrate that Absolute UniFrac captures microbial load, composition, and phylogenetic relationships. While this can improve statistical power to detect ecological shifts, we also find Absolute Unifrac can be strongly correlated to differences in cell abundances alone. To balance these effects, we also incorporate absolute abundance into the generalized extension ((GUA)) that has a tunable  parameter to adjust the influence of abundance and composition. Finally, we benchmark (GUA) and show that although computationally slower than conventional alternatives, (GUA) is comparably insensitive to realistic noise in load estimates compared to conventional alternatives like Bray-Curtis dissimilarities, particularly at lower .

By combining neuronal recordings with functional digital twin models---deep learning-based predictive models of biological neurons---we were able to systematically identify each neuron's preferred and non-preferred features. These feature pairs served as anchors for a continuous, low-dimensional axis in natural image similarity space, along which neuronal activity varied approximately linearly. Within a single visual area, visual features that strongly or weakly activated individual neurons also had a high probability of modulating the activity of other neurons, suggesting a shared feature selectivity across the population that structures stimulus encoding.

Due to evolved resistance, last-resort antibiotics such as the lipooligosaccharide (LOS)-targeting colistin are increasingly used to treat multidrug-resistant isolates. To track the evolution of colistin resistance within a host, we performed sequential oropharyngeal infections in immunocompetent or immune-depleted mice in the presence of inhaled colistin. Both resistant and heteroresistant A. baumannii strains emerged with pmrB mutations that efficiently competed with the susceptible parent in the presence of colistin. The pmrB mutants had a fitness cost in immunocompetent mice in the absence of colistin treatment but retained their ability to colonize the host. In contrast, LOS-deficient A. baumannii mutants removed the target of colistin, but such mutants were unable to colonize the lung. The two pathogenic pmrB mutants showed clear evidence of LOS modification, which was linked to increased transcription of LOS modification enzymes, including the product of the cryptic eptA gene. Spontaneous insertion mutations that caused hyperexpression of eptA allowed the heteroresistant mutant to develop clinically-significant colistin resistance. Insertion mutations upstream of the eptA gene or those disrupting hns, which encodes a small histone-like protein, resulted in increased eptA transcript, linking expression of this protein to clinically significant resistance. The resistant variant selected from the heteroresistant parent was stable in the absence of drug, but continued passaging selected for colistin-resensitized pseudorevertants that were largely due to disruption of the LOS modification enzymes. Therefore, colistin heteroresistance is an early stage in the stepwise acquisition of stable resistance in A. baumannii.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "A hallmark of intelligence is the ability to adapt behavior to changing environments, which requires adapting one's own learning strategies. This phenomenon is known as learning to learn or meta-learning. Although well established in humans and animals, a computational framework that characterizes how biological agents adapt their learning strategies through experience remains elusive. Here we posit that humans update their learning strategies online through a gradient-based meta-learning process, effectively optimizing how they learn. However, estimating how these strategies evolve over time remains a significant challenge since traditional cognitive models, such as reinforcement learning (RL), typically assume that agents use static strategies. To address this, we introduce DynamicRL, a method that leverages neural networks to estimate the evolution of an individual's RL strategy by tracking cognitive parameters such as learning rates over time. Across four human bandit tasks, DynamicRL consistently outperforms traditional RL models with fixed parameters in fitting behavior, confirming that humans adapt their RL strategies over time. RL parameters estimated by DynamicRL reveal trajectories that systematically increase the expected reward of the RL strategy. The parameter updates at each step resemble policy gradient ascent, and their optimality correlates with the strength of the gradient signal. Moreover, these RL parameters evolve more slowly than decision variables, supporting the hierarchical relationship between strategy learning and value learning. Our work provides a computational framework that expands the hypothesis space from understanding strategies to understanding strategy adaptation, bridging adaptive behavior in biological and artificial intelligence through meta-learning.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

J.; Xu, L.; Sharma, I.; Moore, B. M.; Lock, C.; George, K. S.; Bal, A.; Mohanty, C.; Stewart, R.", "abstract": "Background Generating and testing hypotheses is a critical aspect of biomedical science. Typically, researchers generate hypotheses by carefully analyzing available information and making logical connections, which are then tested. The accelerating growth of biomedical literature makes it increasingly difficult to keep pace with connections between biological entities emerging across biomedical research. Recently developed automated means of generating hypotheses can generate many more hypotheses than can be easily tested. One such approach involves literature-based discovery (LBD) systems such as Serial KinderMiner (SKiM), which surfaces putative A-B-C links derived from term co-occurrence. However, LBD systems leave three critical gaps: (i) they find statistical associations, not biological relationships; (ii) they can produce false-positive leads; and (iii) they do not assess agreement with a hypothesis in question. As a result, LBD search results often require costly manual curation to be of practical utility to the researcher. Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to automate much of this curation step, but standalone LLMs are hampered by hallucinations, lack of transparency in information sources, and the inability to reference data not included in the training corpus. Results We introduce SKiM-GPT, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines SKiM's co-occurrence search and retrieval with frontier LLMs to evaluate user-defined hypotheses. For every chosen A-B-C SKiM hit, SKiM-GPT retrieves appropriate PubMed abstract texts, filters out irrelevant abstracts with a fine-tuned relevance model, and prompts an LLM to evaluate the user's hypothesis, given the relevant abstracts. Importantly, the SKiM-GPT system is transparent and human-verifiable: it displays the retrieved abstracts, the hypothesis score, and a justification for the score grounded in the texts and written in natural language. On a benchmark consisting of 14 disease-gene-drug hypotheses, SKiM-GPT achieves strong ordinal agreement with four expert biologists (Cohen's {kappa} = 0.84), demonstrating SKiM-GPT's ability to replicate expert judgment.

We have previously shown that among the two Drosophila executioner caspases, Dcp-1 and Drice, Dcp-1 promotes tissue growth in a non-lethal manner, independent of canonical apoptotic signaling. Herein, we demonstrated that overexpressed Dcp-1, but not Drice, was activated without canonical apoptosome components. TurboID-based proximity labeling revealed distinct proximal proteomes, among which Sirtuin 1, an Atg8a deacetylase, which promotes autophagy, was specifically required for Dcp-1 activation. Autophagy-related genes, including Bcl-2 family members Debcl and Buffy, are required for Dcp-1 activation. Structure-based prediction using AlphaFold3 further identified Bruce, an autophagy-regulated inhibitor of apoptosis, as a Dcp-1-specific regulator acting outside the apoptosome-mediated pathway.

We investigated whether and how system-level computations that transform visual input into perception underlie these heterogeneities. Using the equivalent noise method and perceptual template model, we estimated gain, internal noise, and nonlinearity for orientation discrimination across eccentricity (fovea, parafovea and perifovea) and around polar angle. Participants discriminated the orientation of Gabors embedded in dynamic white noise and showed the expected variations across eccentricity and around polar angle. Importantly, visual performance declined with eccentricity due to decreased gain and nonlinearity and increased internal noise. Observers with stronger eccentricity effects showed greater gain decrease. Only gain varied with polar angle--higher along the horizontal than vertical meridian, and lower than upper vertical meridian--paralleling performance asymmetries. This dissociation aligns with known variations in neuronal count and tuning, suggesting that neural correlations and neural noise contribute to these system-level computations. By revealing distinct system-level computations underlying the eccentricity effect and polar angle asymmetries, our findings link perceptual heterogeneity across the visual field and neural architecture and provide insights into how the human brain encodes information under neural constraints.\n\nSignificance StatementHuman visual performance varies across eccentricity-distance from gaze-and around polar angle -circular dimension. Retinal factors and cortical surface area account for eccentricity, but only partially for polar angle variations. Here, we show that system-level computations--how signal are amplified and how noisy the system is--distinctly underlie these perceptual variations. Decline across eccentricity stems from both reduced gain and nonlinearity and elevated internal noise, whereas variation around polar angle arises solely from gain difference. This dissociation implies fundamental differences in information processing along two axes of the visual field. Our results provide a computational link between behavior and its neural bases and highlight the importance of considering both eccentricity and polar angle in modeling and understanding human perception.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Multimodal classification approaches integrating neuroimaging and cognitive scores may offer early and accurate characterization and subsequently improved diagnostic precision. Methods: In this study, we included 100 participants (50 AD, 30 FTD, including 14 bvFTD and 16 PPA, and 20 MCI) who underwent simultaneous structural MRI and FDG-PET imaging. Cortical thickness (CTH) from anatomical MRI and standardized uptake values from FDG-PET were extracted using FreeSurfer and PETSurfer pipelines, respectively. CTH and FDG-PET features were combined into a single vector through a logistic weighting function derived from ACE-III scores, capturing the progressive nature of cognitive decline in dementia. A Naive Bayes classifier was then trained to differentiate diagnostic groups based on the merged features.Results: The model achieved classification accuracies of 83% for MCI vs. dementia (AD + FTD), 85% for MCI vs. FTD, 87% for MCI vs. PPA, 71% for MCI vs. bvFTD, 64% for MCI vs. AD, and 69% for AD vs. FTD.

Findings remain inconsistent- some report shifts in specific taxa, whereas others observe little change in diversity. To date, no large-scale longitudinal study has examined oral microbiome development across all three trimesters, leaving early gestational dynamics (during the first trimester; T1) largely unexplored. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal analysis of the oral microbiome in 346 pregnant women from Israel and validated key findings in an independent cohort of 154 pregnant women from Russia. In Israel, saliva samples were collected during T1 (11-14 weeks), T2 (24-28 weeks), and T3 (32-38 weeks) trimesters; in Russia, samples were collected during T2 and T3 with similar ranges of gestational weeks. Alongside sample collection, participants completed dietary and health questionnaires to assess maternal factors that could influence microbial composition. Microbial profiles were analyzed to test for (i) differential abundance across trimesters and (ii) the influence of maternal nutrition and lifestyle factors on these dynamics. Results: Significant shifts in oral microbial composition were observed as early as the transition from T1 to T2. Alpha diversity decreased progressively across pregnancy (Shannon index: T1 = 3.261, T2 = 3.173, T3 = 3.109; Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.0023). Notable taxonomic changes included a significant reduction in Verrucomicrobiota (particularly Akkermansia muciniphila) and an increase in Synergistota from T1 to T2 (adjusted p < 0.01), alongside an increase in Gammaproteobacteria and a decrease in Erysipelotrichia, suggesting an ecological shift towards potentially pro-inflammatory communities. Despite these systematic population-level changes, within-subject microbial distances across trimesters were smaller than between-subject distances, indicating that individual women maintained relatively stable microbial profiles over time. Among 54 maternal variables examined, gluten-free diet showed the strongest and most consistent associations with oral microbiome composition across all trimesters, followed by smoking history and conception method. Key findings were validated in an independent cohort of 154 Russian women. Conclusions: This study provides the first large-scale evidence of significant oral microbiome changes beginning in early pregnancy, characterized by reduced diversity and a directional shift toward potentially pro-inflammatory communities. The strong associations with gluten consumption and smoking suggest a large-scale effect of lifestyle on the pregnancy oral microbiome.

This is counterintuitive, since salt concentration increases dramatically as the drop's water evaporates, making the drop a harsh environment for virions. It has been hypothesized that the drop components (mainly salt and the glycoprotein mucin) segregate during the evaporation process, with virions being transported away from salt deposits. This would protect them from the salt's damaging effects. Thus, understanding where virions reside in a drop residue is essential to disentangle the physico-chemical mechanisms that drive their inactivation. However, determining the virion location in an environment as heterogeneous and complex as a respiratory drop is challenging. Here we show by electron microscopy that virions in the drop's dry residue are found mainly forming aggregates in protein-rich regions, away from salt crystals. We complement our experimental observations with a theoretical description of the flow inside the drop, which allows to elucidate the transport mechanisms yielding the observed viral spatial distribution.

We applied a novel geometric analysis to quantify movement-trajectory shape.

This location is known to produce spectacular migration events with thousands of passerine birds flying at close range from the observers. We recorded sequences of individual birds moving just over the ground in a [~]20 m wide corridor along the edge of the St. Lawrence estuary. We also conducted hourly counts to detect conspecific clusters at a coarser temporal scale. Birds were much more likely to be following conspecifics at close range than other species, as evidenced by randomization tests, after accounting for species composition and abundance during each specific migration event. Conspecific sequences were mostly of two individuals, but much larger sequences occurred, up to 103 consecutive individuals of the same species. We found no evidence of leading species, i.e. species that were more likely to lead, rather than follow, another species.

Of particular interest are the intermediate CA1 (iCA1) and CA3 (iCA3) subfields, which have both been shown to be causally involved in social recognition. Historically, the dense feed-forward projections from CA3 to CA1 led to the view that these subfields form a hierarchical circuit, with CA1 primarily integrating and refining computations from CA3. However, recent causal manipulations of the iCA1 and iCA3 have revealed distinct and separable contributions to approach and avoidance behavior, suggesting functional specialization across the subfields. This functional divergence raises the possibility that iCA1 and iCA3 might differentially encode social recognition information. To test this possibility, we performed one-photon calcium imaging in freely behaving mice to record endogenous activity from the iCA1 and iCA3 during a novel behavioral paradigm that disentangles social identity from spatial position. Notably, we found that iCA3 neurons more robustly discriminated between novel and familiar conspecifics, while iCA1 neurons more strongly encoded spatial position. These results identify the iCA3 as a key locus for social novelty encoding and suggest a functional division of labor within the hippocampus, in which stable spatial frameworks in the iCA1 anchor flexible, context-dependent social representations in the iCA3 that support adaptive social memory.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), venetoclax combined with hypomethylating agents is the standard of care for patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy, but intrinsic and acquired resistance are common. Loss of p53 function is strongly associated with venetoclax resistance, and adding venetoclax to 5-azacitidine provides no overall survival benefit in TP53-mutant AML. Other frequent mechanisms of venetoclax resistance in AML include FLT3 mutations, MCL-1 upregulation, and altered mitochondrial metabolism. Unfortunately, it has been challenging to develop agents that target these mechanisms directly and combinatorially. Here we report that pitavastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA-reductase, promotes apoptosis and overcomes several venetoclax resistance mechanisms in human AML cells. At clinically achievable concentrations, pitavastatin treatment has potent cytotoxic activity in cells with mutations in TP53 or FLT3. The apoptotic mechanism involves p53-independent PUMA upregulation and reduced MCL-1 expression. Pitavastatin also suppresses mitochondrial gene expression and oxidative metabolism. The pro-apoptotic actions of pitavastatin depend on depletion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and can be recapitulated by inhibiting GGPP synthase or geranylgeranyltransferase-1 enzymes. These results provide a mechanistic rationale for adding pitavastatin to AML regimens to prevent or overcome venetoclax resistance.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Comparative analyses revealed exceptionally high repeat content in both Asteraceae and Calyceraceae, pervasive chromosomal rearrangements, and evidence for shared and lineage-specific whole-genome duplications. In Asteraceae, tandem and dispersed duplications disproportionately drove expansions of gene families linked to secondary metabolism and stress response, while segmental duplicates bore signatures of adaptive selection for the regulation of biosynthetic and metabolic processes. Selective pressures on regulators of flowering time, but not on core flowering time genes, suggest an evolved balance between regulatory flexibility and developmental constraint in floral diversification.

After transient induction of either DNA methylation or H3K9me3, stable silencing was exclusively observed with both marks.

Litter samples (n = 18) were collected from three commercial broiler houses following flock removal: one control (NaHSO-only), one treated with IndigoLT for a single flock, and one treated for two consecutive flocks. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to assess prokaryotic community composition.

Yet the neural circuit that transforms gustatory input into motivationally relevant signals remains poorly defined in any model system. In Drosophila melanogaster, substantial progress has been made in mapping the sensorimotor pathway for feeding and the architecture of the dopaminergic reinforcement system. However, where and how valence is first assigned to a taste has long been a mystery. Here, we identified a pair of subesophageal zone interneurons in Drosophila, termed Fox, that impart positive valence to sweet taste and convey this signal to the mushroom body, the fly's associative learning center. We show that Fox neuron activity is necessary and sufficient to drive appetitive behaviors and can override a tastant's intrinsic valence without impairing taste quality discrimination. Furthermore, Fox neurons transmit the positive valence to specific dopaminergic neurons that mediate appetitive memory formation. Our findings reveal a circuit mechanism that transforms sweet sensation into a reinforcing signal to support learned sugar responses. The Fox neurons exhibit a convergent-divergent \"hourglass\" circuit motif, acting as a bottleneck for valence assignment and distributing motivational signals to higher-order centers.

J.", "abstract": "Type I IFN, including IFN-, induces the expression of antiviral restriction factors that can interfere with multiple steps of the HIV-1 replication cycle. Humans have 13 IFN- genes which encode 12 different IFN- subtypes. Our previous work in HIV-1 infected humanized mice showed that IFN-14 treatment more potently controlled HIV-1 than treatment with the clinically approved IFN-2 subtype. However, the mechanisms behind the more potent control of HIV-1 by IFN-14 are unknown. The IFN-14 subtype is known to more potently induce the expression of the restriction factors MX2 and ISG15 and increased APOBEC3G signature mutations in vivo compared to IFN-2. To study the importance of each of these restriction factors in mediating the potent control of HIV-1, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 lentivirus system to create stable knockouts in the MT4C5 cell line that is susceptible to HIV-1 but does not produce measurable amounts of endogenous IFN-. Knock out of ISG15, but not MX2, eliminated differences in viral suppression after IFN-14 and IFN-2 treatment. Similarly, APOBEC3G deletion eliminated differences in viral suppression and the number of infectious particles produced after IFN-14 and IFN-2 treatment. Furthermore, APOBEC3G deletion resulted in significantly fewer GG[-&gt;]AG mutations in viral DNA isolated from target cells incubated with supernatant from IFN-14 treated groups. However, APOBEC3G knock out did not result in significant increases in vDNA compared to the wild type in any experimental group. Overall, elimination of APOBEC3G and ISG15 impaired IFN-14-mediated suppression of HIV-1, highlighting them as downstream effectors of IFN-14s more potent anti-HIV-1 activity.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis study uncovers the molecular basis for the more potent antiviral activity of IFN-14 compared to the clinically used IFN-2 subtype against HIV-1. Although interferons are known to induce numerous restriction factors, the mechanisms underlying subtype-specific antiviral potency remained unclear. By using CRISPR-Cas9 knockout MT4C5 cell lines, the study identifies ISG15 and APOBEC3G as key effectors mediating IFN-14s enhanced suppression of HIV-1 replication. Loss of either ISG15 or APOBEC3G abolished the differential antiviral effect between IFN-14 and IFN-2, demonstrating their essential roles in IFN-14 driven viral restriction. These findings highlight that individual IFN- subtypes engage distinct downstream pathways and that subtype diversity encodes functional specialization rather than redundancy. Overall, this work advances our understanding of innate immune control of HIV-1 and provides a foundation for developing targeted interferon-based therapies that exploit the unique mechanisms of potent subtypes like IFN- 14.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

In Stage 1, the model determines whether a publication describes any form of protein autoregulation. In Stage 2, positive instances are further classified into one of seven mechanistic categories: autophosphorylation, autoubiquitination, autocatalytic activity, autoinhibition, autolysis, autoinducer production, and autoregulation. SOORENA was fine-tuned from PubMedBERT using a curated dataset of 1,332 experimentally validated abstracts sourced from UniProt-referenced publications. On a held-out test set, Stage 1 achieved an accuracy of 96.0% and a precision of 97.8%, effectively minimizing false positive propagation. Stage 2 demonstrated robust performance across all classes, with an overall accuracy of 95.5% and a macro-F1 score of 96.2%, including perfect classification for the two least-represented categories.

Previously, bacteria were shown to initiate ribosome hibernation by activating protective proteins known as hibernation factors. It was demonstrated that hibernation factors prevent ribosome degradation by nucleases, which allows bacteria to safely store their inactive ribosomes and survive under starvation or persistent stress. Because homologs of hibernation factors were found in diverse lineages of bacteria, it is currently assumed that the mechanism of ribosome hibernation is highly conserved across species. Here, we assess 46,015 complete bacterial genomes to reveal the principles underlying the origin and evolution of these essential proteins in bacterial cells. We find that hibernation factors emerged in ancient bacteria as relatively large proteins that then gradually reduced in size and have undergone complete extinction in over 10% of studied bacteria. We then demonstrate that the degeneration of ancient hibernation factors is often accompanied by \"borrowing\" hibernation factors from other species via gene transfers, de novo gene birth or fusion of truncated hibernation factors with fragments from other stress-response proteins. These findings reveal a unique evolutionary pathway in which bacteria respond to the reductive evolution of hibernation machinery by inventing novel hibernation mechanisms, thus restoring their capacity to survive starvation and stress.

We combined field observations and statistical modeling to identify the environmental drivers of stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) in Florida. We then performed environmental manipulation experiments to confirm the effects of identified factors on immunity in the massive coral Montastraea cavernosa. SCTLD susceptibility was influenced most by the interaction between temperature and chlorophyll-a concentration (nutrients proxy) the month prior to disease survey, as well as the interaction between chlorophyll-a and three-month mean PAR. SCTLD prevalence was highest when temperatures were low (<30 {degrees}C) and chlorophyll-a concentration exceeded [~]6 mg m-3 and/or when PAR and chlorophyll-a concentrations were high. SCTLD severity had a negative relationship with temperature, a colony had a higher probability of dying during the SCTLD outbreak when temperatures stayed below 31.08 {degrees}C, a finding in contrast to previous coral disease studies. In the laboratory, coral fragments were exposed to temperature and nutrient manipulation, then immune challenged. Heat stress largely drove suppression of baseline immunity but increased production of some antioxidants, suggesting host stress. Fragments exposed to moderate ammonium concentration induced the strongest immune responses compared to those grown under high or no ammonium conditions. Combined with modeling results, these findings support long-standing hypotheses that coral disease susceptibility is at least, in part, modulated by environmentally induced changes in immunity.

Within ecological communities, species often face trade-offs between adapting to shifting abiotic conditions and navigating the complex selective pressures imposed by interaction networks. We hypothesize that network architectures characterized by high interaction diversity and overlap constrain coevolutionary dynamics, with asymmetric outcomes for exploiters and victims. Specifically, we predict that exploiters, subject to spread and conflicting selection imposed by their victims, will evolve more slowly and show reduced capacity to track victims evolutionary responses, with these constraints strongest for generalist exploiters. In contrast, victims will show more variable dynamics depending on the coherence of selection (i.e., whether pressures from different exploiters push the victims trait in the same vs. different directions). To test this, we simulated trait evolution in coevolving communities of exploiters and victims across 91 empirical networks, and in artificial networks designed to isolate specific structural effects. Our results show that higher connectance, species richness, nestedness, and centrality homogenize biotic effects and increase fluctuations in trait matching, ultimately weakening coevolutionary coupling. Under these conditions, exploiters face conflicting selection that slows evolution, whereas victims either benefit from aligned selection that accelerates evolution or are constrained by multiple pressures. Together, our findings suggest that network architecture plays a fundamental role in shaping coevolution and adaptation, and raises broader questions about its influence on eco-evolutionary processes in more complex and environmentally variable systems.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

To make reliable inferences, such models must be able to reflect the properties of real tumours. Recent work has shown that lung tumours undergo frequent and late subclonal expansions, which are associated with poor prognosis. This paper tests three candidate simulations of three-dimensional tumour growth, which make different assumptions about the nature of competition between cells, for their ability to replicate these late expansions. Only a model which assumes stringent competition between tumour cells for existing tissue space, after the tumour has reached a fixed size, can produce multiregion sequencing data realistic to lung tumours. This work also assesses the influence of these assumptions on the inferred selection strength of individual tumours in a large cohort of lung cancers, and finds that inferences from a well-tailored model produce much higher estimates than poorly-tailored models of the effects of driver mutations on cell fitness.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/686578v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c2e34eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d92318org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8f2288org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1243703_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Computational simulations of tumour evolution are increasingly used to infer the rules underlying cancer growth, with the goal of one day recommending tailored treatments.

Here, we investigated the role of the putative Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing enzyme PfJmjC2 (PF3D7_0602800) in maintaining chromatin organization and histone modification balance during the asexual blood stages of the parasite. Using a conditional glmS ribozyme-mediated knockdown system, we achieved a ~70% reduction in PfJmjC2 transcript and protein levels, which resulted in a marked delay in DNA replication and intraerythrocytic development. Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PfJmjC2 physically interacts with histone H2A, suggesting an association with the nucleosome core. Upon PfJmjC2 depletion, the balance of epigenetic marks was disrupted, indicating a shift toward a more compact and transcriptionally repressed chromatin state. MNase-ChIP-PCR analysis further showed that PfJmjC2 associates with nucleosome-dense regions, including var gene promoters, although its reduction did not alter var gene transcription or switching patterns. Together, these findings indicate that PfJmjC2 contributes to chromatin organization and nucleosome stability rather than direct transcriptional control, highlighting its potential role in maintaining chromatin compaction and epigenetic homeostasis in P. falciparum.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify arginine vasopressin (AVP) neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) of the hypothalamus as a critical driver of these changes. Using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of the anterior hypothalamus in young and aged mice, we found Avp to be one of the most upregulated neuronal transcripts with age. Aged SON-AVP neurons displayed enlarged size and heightened excitability, features consistent with hyperactivity. Functionally, chemogenetic activation of SON-AVP neurons in young mice reproduced aging-associated phenotypes including hypothermia, reduced energy expenditure, and suppressed water intake. Conversely, knockdown of Avp in the SON of aged mice restored water balance, partially improved thermoregulation and systemic metabolism. Pharmacological inhibition of AVP receptors revealed that neuroendocrine release of AVP drives homeostatic deficits, with distinct roles for V1A and V2 receptors. Senolytic drug treatment improved systemic metabolism and reduced inflammaging but does not rescue hypothalamic AVP dysfunction, underscoring a brain autonomous mechanism of age-related physiological failure. Together, our findings establish SON-AVP neuronal hyperactivity as a driver of impaired homeostasis with age and suggest that targeted modulation of neuroendocrine AVP signaling may offer a therapeutic strategy to alleviate age-associated water balance defects.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we identified a special group of nodule-specific non-symbiotic leghemoglobin genes (AhLghs) in the crack entry legume peanut; however, their functional role and transcriptional regulation remain enigmatic. A comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that the downregulation of nodule inception (AhNIN) and non-symbiotic leghemoglobin (AhLghs) genes played a pivotal role in the nitrate-mediated inhibition of nodulation in peanut. The knockdown of AhLghs and overexpression of AhLgh1 resulted in lower and higher leghemoglobin content, respectively, corroborating their roles as positive regulators of nitrogen fixation in peanut. On the other hand, knockdown of AhNINs not only inhibited root nodulation but also decreased leghemoglobin content in peanut. Further, the DNA-affinity purification sequencing (DAP-Seq) analysis identified various nodulation genes, including AhLghs, as targets of AhNINs. After validating DNA-protein interaction by EMSA, the transactivation assay revealed that AhNINs can positively regulate AhLgh1 after binding to the NIN RESPONSIVE CIS ELEMENT (NRCE) of its promoter. Our work bridges a critical gap in understanding how nitrate influences non-symbiotic leghemoglobin expression by targeting rhizobia-induced NINs in peanut, and offers a potential model suggesting that the nitrate-NIN-Lgh module might represent a key evolutionary event in fine-tuning root nodulation.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

In an anesthetized rat preparation, controlled stretches of the medial gastrocnemius were applied with springs (0-0.5 N/mm) attached in parallel to the muscle-tendon unit (MTU) to simulate passive exoskeleton assistance. Fascicle length was measured with sonomicrometry, force and MTU length with a servo motor, and spindle instantaneous firing rate (IFR) with dorsal root recordings. Increasing exoskeleton stiffness decreased biological muscle force (3.1 {+/-} 0.6 N to 1.6 {+/-} 0.6 N, p < 0.001) and stiffness (4.4 {+/-} 1.5 N/mm to 2.3 {+/-} 1.3 N/mm, p < 0.01), while fascicle length increased (7.9 {+/-} 1.3 mm to 8.3 {+/-} 1.5 mm, p < 0.005). Despite these altered mechanics, spindle firing did not significantly change, and showed weak correlations with muscle length, velocity, force, and yank (R2 > 0.14).

However, the practical use of affective pictures is limited by several factors, including the difficulty of obtaining content-diverse, high-quality, openly accessible, and standardized stimuli that are necessary for specific research questions. The use of artificially generated (AI) pictures could address this limitation, but it is unclear if AI-generated pictures evoke reliable emotional responses. The present study sought to address these challenges by comparing emotional responses to AI-generated pictures with responses to original, standardized, pictures. In two study iterations, standardized pictures containing pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant content were selected from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and other sources. Then, a matched AI-counterpart was created for each original picture using generative deep neural networks. A total of 109 participants viewed the picture sets while pupil diameter and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded. Evaluative ratings of hedonic valence and emotional arousal were also collected. For both AI and original exemplars, pictures depicting emotional content elicited stronger responses than neutral content for ratings and EEG-derived variables, with weaker effect sizes for the AI-generated pictures. Furthermore, picture-level analyses found that ratings and EEG measures were strongly correlated between matched AI and original pictures. Pupil data also showed the expected content effects in study iteration 2, but not in iteration 1. Together, this initial study suggests that AI-generated picture sets can effectively elicit well-established self-reported affect and physiological responses, presenting a promising avenue for future studies of human emotion.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

In male but not female mice, inflammatory activation of microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of diet-induced obesity (DIO), raising the possibility that differences in microglial estrogen signaling may account for the sexual dimorphism. In this study, we assessed metabolic and CNS histopathological properties in a mouse model with inducible microglia-specific ablation of ER (MG-ERKO). Male MG-ERKO mice developed increased weight gain and insulin resistance relative to controls during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Indirect calorimetry analysis revealed that reduced energy expenditure was the main driver of the obese phenotype. In contrast, female MG-ERKO mice fed HFD developed mild insulin resistance with no change in body weight gain compared to controls. Immunohistochemical analyses of the microglial activation marker IBA1 in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) revealed that female MG-ERKO mice had increased number of microglia without showing morphological signs of activation. In contrast, MBH microglial number was unchanged in MG-ERKO male mice, but the cells adopted more activated morphological profiles. Finally, HFD-fed MG-ERKO male mice had increased POMC neuron-microglia interactions but fewer overall hypothalamic POMC neurons, suggesting microglia may disrupt POMC neuron integrity to promote DIO. Together, these findings indicate that sex-specific actions of estrogen in microglia limit the metabolic complications of HFD feeding.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

This transition requires epithelialization and changes in nuclear architecture. We sought to determine whether the cell and tissue mechanics intrinsic to epithelialization drive pluripotency progression and subsequent lineage commitment to neuroectodermal fate. We demonstrate that naive mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) undergoing early differentiation in vitro recapitulate features of epithelialization in the peri-implantation epiblast, specifically apical constriction. We further demonstrate that cell contractility during apical constriction induces a distinct nuclear mechanoresponse, notably enrichment of emerin at the outer nuclear membrane, nuclear envelope localization of SUN2, and the global loss of H3K9me3 heterochromatin which is compensated by H3K27me3. Importantly, these nuclear phenotypes and subsequent neuroectodermal lineage priming require myosin II-mediated contractility, an intact LINC complex, and emerin. We demonstrate that LINC-dependent mechanotransduction through emerin regulates H3K27me3 occupancy on the key early neuroectodermal transcription factor gene, Sox1, implicating a mechanical switch in chromatin mediation of neuroectodermal lineage competence. These results indicate that epithelialization-induced nuclear mechanotransduction poises a critical lineage gene for subsequent expression.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

With age, it is thought that mitochondrial quality control becomes dysregulated, leading to the progression of age-associated diseases such as sarcopenia. Exercise is known to enhance skeletal muscle mitochondrial health and may be an effective intervention to prevent sarcopenia, however the role of mitophagy in this process is unknown. Utilising mitophagy reporter mice (mito-QC), we assessed adaptations in skeletal muscle mitophagy in response to increased age (3-26 months) and following an 8-week endurance exercise training period. Immunofluorescent imaging revealed that ageing led to an accumulation of mitolysosomes in sarcopenic old mice indicative of increased mitophagy, an adaptive response that was reversed by exercise training. In parallel to reducing age-associated mitophagy, exercise training increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity and improved muscle strength, suggesting that alterations in mitochondrial quality control led to improvements in skeletal muscle function. Exercise-mediated alterations in mitophagy were accompanied by increases in BNIP3, FUNDC1 and BCL2L13 protein content post training. Collectively our data suggests that sarcopenia leads to dysregulation of mitophagy in skeletal muscle. Restoring mitophagy balance with exercise training leads to improvements in mitochondrial respiration and skeletal muscle strength, identifying a novel cellular mechanism to explain the benefits of exercise training in old age.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

These mice were crossed with tdTomato reporter (Ai9) mice, and studies showed selective tamoxifen-induced transgene expression in CD31-/CD34+ telocyte-like cells in knee and ankle synovium, and in networks physically associated with mast cells proximal to popliteal lymphatic vessels (PLVs). Consistent with the known loss of CD31-/CD34+ telocyte in RA synovium, these cells were also decreased in TNF-tg knees and partially recovered by anti-TNF treatment. Ultrastructural and gene expression studies confirmed a distinct telocyte phenotype versus closely related fibroblasts. In vivo depletion studies in tamoxifen-treated Efhd1-CreERT2 and Myoc-CreERT2 mice crossed to diphtheria toxin alpha-floxed (DTAflox) mice demonstrated telocyte requirements for physiologic lymphatic drainage and resolution of joint inflammation and focal erosions from zymosan-induced arthritis in the knee. In vitro studies demonstrated increased sensitivity to osmotic shock and decreased motility versus fibroblasts, and telocyte potential to differentiate into myofibroblasts on stiff matrix.

We applied flow cytometric and transcriptomic single cell definitions of dNK subtypes to dNK at the chorioamniotic membranes (CAM) and basal plate (BP) of the placenta at term.

From this vast possible organisation called morphospace, an unknown mechanism governs the diverse organisation of epithelia. We investigated this mechanism using the mechanosensory epithelia of fish, birds, and mammals. These epithelia have two cell types: mechanosensory hair cells (HCs) and supporting cells (SCs). Across these epithelia, HC and SC share a similar developmental lineage and molecular signatures but organise differently, making it an ideal system. Using a quantitative, morphospace framework we show the large diversity in sensory epithelia develops from a small overlapping initial state. This initial state with small, circular HCs surrounded by larger SCs is governed by Notch-Delta signalling. As development proceeds, the differential recruitment of Cdh2, Nectin, and -actinin-4 generates a junctional heterogeneity. This junctional heterogeneity induces a cell-type selective jamming transition: HCs become mechanically jammed while SCs remain fluid-like. This cell-type-specific mechanical state drives differential intercalation, leading to the differential organisation. By regulating this transition of cellular state, epithelia are guided towards their morphospace. Our work proposes the cell-type specific mechanical state and the genetic constrains as mechanism that drives patterning of mechano-sensory epithelia and potentially others.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

In addition, younger animals were significantly more infected and exhibited higher parasitemia levels, especially those with triple infections involving P. vivax-like. Profiling of 15 hematological markers and 8 cytokines/chemokines known to be associated with malarial infections in humans revealed significant alterations in infected chimpanzees, including elevated urea, reduced creatinine, and increased systemic concentrations of pro-inflammatory (TNF, IL-1{beta}, CCL3) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines.

J.", "abstract": "How microevolutionary processes translate to macroevolutionary patterns is a central question in evolutionary biology. Macroevolutionary and biogeographic studies often rely on species trees to make inferences about diversification, but gene flow can lead to incorrect phylogenetic inference. Under a range of biogeographic conditions, gene flow may not occur uniformly across space during diversification, which could lead to macroevolutionary misinferences. For example, whenever a \"peripheral\" population is relatively isolated and inferred as sister to a \"core\" clade of populations that exchange migrants, it might solely reflect gene flow, as opposed to macroevolutionary processes such as the order of biogeographic dispersal events. We use simulations of the hypothetical case of spatially heterogeneous gene flow described above and found that relatively low levels of gene flow led to monophyly of the adjacent populations, with longer branches for peripheral taxa, regardless of the true divergence history. We highlight an empirical example wherein lowland antbirds (Family: Thamnophilidae)-a clade known for dynamic gene flow in Amazonia-tend to be young in Amazonia, but older at Amazonias periphery. Although it is challenging to know if the simulated bias applies here, our work suggests a distinguishability problem for any nodes stemming from radiations in geographically heterogeneous environments.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

H.; Diep, C. H.; Krutilina, R. I.; Smith, H.; Seagroves, T. N.; Blenis, J.; Lange, C. A.", "abstract": "In triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), p38 MAPK phosphorylates the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at N-terminal Ser134 in response to cytokines, such as TGF{beta}1. Phospho-Ser134-GR (pSer134-GR) regulates genes that promote migratory/invasive behavior and altered metabolism. In addition to acting as ligands for GR, glucocorticoids also activate closely-related mineralocorticoid receptors (MR). Elevated MR activity via its physiological ligand aldosterone (aldo), mediates hypertension, inflammation and fibrosis. While GR/p-GR has been implicated in TNBC progression to metastasis, the contribution of MR remains unknown. The METABRIC dataset demonstrated significantly higher expression of MR transcripts in TNBC relative to luminal breast cancers. Further, high MR expression predicted worse overall survival in the KM-plotter database. We observed pSer134-GR- and p38-dependent association of cytoplasmic MR/p-GR complexes upon treatment of TNBC cells with TGF{beta}1, while nuclear MR-GR complexes predominated in response to dexamethasone (dex) and/or aldo. Cytoplasmic MR/p-GR complexes entered the nucleus within 4 hours. MR knockdown or inhibition with MR-selective antagonists (spironolactone, finerenone) significantly reduced aldo or TGF{beta}1-induced migratory and stemness properties. MR knockdown models exhibited reduced migration, attenuated stem cell expansion, and impaired metastasis to lungs following tail-vein injection, thereby phenocopying cells harboring phospho-mutant S134A-GR. MR activation by aldo or TGF{beta}1 transcriptionally upregulated both canonical MR-target genes (SGK1, ENaC1) and non-canonical target genes related to fibrosis (COL1A1, ICAM1 and CTGF). MR expression was essential for functionally intact p38 MAPK/p-Ser134-GR signaling downstream of TGF{beta}1 receptor activation. Our studies define a novel role of MR/p-GR complexes in regulation of TNBC cell migration, stemness potential, and metastasis. Pharmacological inhibition of MR with FDA-approved MR antagonists (MRAs) offers an exciting opportunity for improved clinical management of TNBC patients.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Two dominant models propose that target specificity arises either from early inter-regional exuberant outgrowth followed by pruning, or through initially directed axonal targeting. To resolve this, we systematically mapped the postnatal development of V1 cortico-cortical projection neurons (CCPNs) to eleven higher visual areas (HVAs) in mice using rapid and complementary retrograde, anterograde, and single-cell tracing methods. We found that V1[-&gt;]HVA connectivity develops via spatiotemporally staggered axon extension and pruning programs, aligned with target position along the medial-lateral axis. Reciprocal HVA[-&gt;]V1 feedback emerges concurrently and is refined over time, yielding gradually aligned bidirectional connectivity. Notably, both multiplexed retrograde tracing and MAPseq-based single-cell profiling revealed that individual V1 neurons initialize and retain specific projection motifs with limited variation over development, arguing against global exuberance followed by selective, inter-areal pruning. Instead, our findings support a directed guidance model, in which distinct V1 CCPN subtypes establish selective projection patterns early, followed by local, target-dependent refinement.

How the visual system represents such active and passive motion components is poorly understood. To address these questions, we developed an assay to dissect the motion of freely moving mice into active and passive components and to study its influence upon neural activity in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and adjacent regions. Chronically implanted mice were placed in an arena where they actively moved; at irregular intervals, the arena was tilted, resulting in passive movement. We then used 3D tracking to decompose mouse head motion into active and passive components. We observed widespread responses to tilt events in dLGN, which persisted in darkness. Light-responsive units exhibited mixed selectivity for active and passive motion, primarily encoding the speed of self-motion irrespectively of its causes. However, individual neurons varied in their relative tuning to active versus passive components, allowing partial separation at the population level. Furthermore, a decoding analysis showed that population activity decorrelated active and passive head motion signals by representing their leading principal components. Together, these results indicate that, during natural behaviour, the visual thalamus takes advantage of the coupled dynamics of active and passive movements to encode an efficient, low-dimensional representation of the subject's motion.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Methods: Neutrophils were isolated via negative selection from seven SLE patients and three healthy individuals. RNA sequencing was performed to assess transcriptomic differences, ex vivo dynamics over 60 minutes, and responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Additionally, longitudinal transcriptomic data from an SLE patient undergoing KYV-101 anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy were evaluated. Results: We identified 258 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) consistently distinguishing SLE from healthy neutrophils; they spanned multiple clusters, enriched in interferon-related and DNA damage repair genes (upregulated), and ribosomal protein genes (downregulated). Ex vivo adaptation revealed shared activation pathways, such as NF-{kappa}B and apoptosis, in both groups. LPS stimulation highlighted overlapping inflammatory responses, demonstrating retained functional capacities in SLE neutrophils. Following CAR T-cell therapy of an SLE patient,neutrophil transcriptomic profiles realigned with healthy controls by three months post-treatment. Conclusions: Neutrophils in SLE exhibit intrinsic, disease-specific transcriptomic alterations while sharing ex vivo adaptation dynamics with healthy individuals. The disease-specific alterations appear to be modifiable through targeted therapeutic intervention, as anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy resets neutrophil gene expression toward healthy patterns despite targeting B cells rather than neutrophils directly.

Although dominance may arguably arise from distal modifiers, their selective advantage is debated due to presumably small individual effects. To address this longstanding question, particularly how genetic dominance manifests at the transcriptomic level and contributes to phenotypic heterosis, we integrated transcriptomic and phenotypic data from a large population of maize hybrids and their inbred parents. We found that {approx} 30% of the expressed seedling genes in a significant proportion of hybrids exhibited expression patterns deviating from the average of the two parents, indicative of non-additivity. Further analysis suggests that while hybrid gene expression per se is primarily regulated by cis-eQTLs, expression dominance (or non-additivity) is disproportionately controlled by trans-eQTLs. These trans-eQTLs cluster into hotspots that regulate the non-additivity of hundreds of target genes, mostly within co-expression networks, and are notably enriched for transcription factors (TFs). Focusing on one such hotspot, we functionally validated a classical maize gene ZmR1, a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF associated with multiple seedling trait heterosis, as a candidate regulator of expression dominance across hundreds of genes. Overexpression of ZmR1 enhances expression dominance of downstream genes and increases phenotypic heterosis in both seedling and adult traits. Further experiments confirmed its direct regulatory role in modulating genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis and lignin metabolism, driving transcriptome-level dominance. These results provide empirical support for the modifier hypothesis under an omnigenic model, suggesting that heterosis arises not from the modification of a single gene's inheritance but through the coordinated regulation of hundreds of phenotype-associated genes, thereby helping to reconcile the long-standing debate over the genetic basis of dominance in heterosis.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Herein, we integrate a time-calibrated phylotranscriptomic tree of 50 copepod species with ancestral trait reconstruction, gene family copy number variation, and palaeoceanographic data to infer the evolutionary timing and ecological drivers of hypoxia adaptation. Our results support that post-embryonic dormancy originated in calanoid ancestors, accompanied by widespread gene expansions primarily involving hypoxia-response pathways as well as lipid and amino acid metabolism. Mesopelagic colonisation by calanoid lineages likely occurred during the Ordovician deep-sea oxygenation event. This was followed, during the Carboniferous deep-sea deoxygenation, by a secondary habitat shift toward shallower waters and embryonic dormancy, and gene contractions in the superfamily Diaptomoidea. We further analysed the hypoxia-induced transcriptomic response of Eucalanus hyalinus from the Benguela upwelling OMZ, and identified a coordinated response involving extracellular matrix remodelling, amino acid recycling for anaerobic energy and antioxidant production as well as triglycerides to wax ester conversion.

This study presents a systematic review of 288 articles that assessed the temperature effects on six reproductive traits: fertility, fecundity, mating traits, egg hatching, gamete and gonad traits and four life-history traits: longevity, mortality, viability and development time in Drosophila species. The results reveal an increase in publications since 1995 and 45 different species employed, with Drosophila melanogaster being the dominant model organism. Heat stress was more frequently studied than cold stress, and most experiments involved adult life-stages under constant temperatures. Fecundity and longevity were the most frequently measured traits. Most studies applied constant temperature stress and long-term exposure and few studies examined thermal pre-treatments or artificial selection to evaluate adaptive responses. The data reveals geographical and taxonomic biases, with limited representation from tropical regions and non-model species. This comprehensive dataset underscores the need for broader species coverage, inclusion of variable thermal regimes, and consideration of sex- and stage-specific sensitivities.

Genes under differential selection against cryptic transcription are enriched for longevity-related transcriptomic signatures and are co-regulated by transcriptional regulators such as MYC and E2F. Notably, I uncover MLS-linked variation in the transcriptional fidelity of epigenetic regulators, especially Polycomb and MLL/COMPASS complex members, as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, suggesting a close link between longevity and epithelial plasticity. Components of the PRC1.6 complex, which repress germline genes and MYC/E2F/Brachyury targets in somatic cells, show broadly elevated transcriptional fidelity in long-lived species. Conversely, key EMT genes such as ZEB2 and SNAI2 exhibit reduced fidelity. Peripheral tissues in long-lived mammals adopt \"brain-like\" transcriptomic profiles, potentially via derepression of PRC1.6 targets, thereby enhancing somatic maintenance. Reduced fidelity of EMT genes may buffer against maladaptive EMT and preserve epithelial identity. Finally, mouse aging is linked to epithelial plasticity. This study provides insights into the evolution of mammalian longevity and the stochastic components of aging.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we combine Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) and a multiplex single cell CRISPRa screen to discover functional human neural enhancers whose CRISPRa targeting yields specific upregulation of NDD risk genes. First, we tested 5,425 candidate neuronal enhancers with MPRA, identifying 2,422 that are active in human neurons. Selected cCREs also displayed specific, autonomous in vivo activity in the developing mouse central nervous system. Next, we applied multiplex single-cell CRISPRa screening with 15,643 gRNAs to test all MPRA-prioritized cCREs and 761 promoters of NDD genes in their endogenous genomic contexts. We identified hundreds of promoter- and enhancer-targeting CRISPRa gRNAs that upregulated 200 of the 337 NDD genes in human neurons, including 91 novel enhancer-gene pairs. Finally, we confirmed that several of the CRISPRa gRNAs identified here demonstrated selective and therapeutically relevant upregulation of SCN2A, CHD8, CTNND2 and TCF4 when delivered virally to patient cell lines, human cerebral organoids, and a humanized mouse model of hTcf4.

Here, we present a major update to LipidOne, a user-friendly web-based platform for lipidomic data interpretation (lipidone.eu), introducing the novel analytical module: Functional Lipid Analysis (FLA). This component enables the assessment of the quantitative features of lipidomic datasets through a biologically structured, index-based approach. The FLA module computes 42 indices representing specific lipid function including membrane structure, energy storage, and signaling. These indices are derived from lipid classes, molecular species, and fatty acyl-, alkyl-, and alkenyl-chain composition. Each index is statistically compared across experimental groups and analyzed and visualized through dedicated tools, including bar plots, volcano plots, PCA, PLS-DA, heatmaps, and functional radar charts. Every index is semantically annotated with biologically meaningful phrases, allowing users to move beyond numerical variations and toward mechanistic insights of lipid function. In the FLA module, index variations are further linked to predicted protein mediators, bridging lipid alterations to enzymatic pathways and enabling network-based interpretations. This integrative strategy lays the foundation for a systems biology perspective, connecting lipidomics to proteomics and or transcriptomics yielding functional pathway analysis. We demonstrate the utility of this framework using datasets from two published works. In both cases, FLA confirmed the authors conclusions and yielded additional, biologically coherent functional readouts not originally emphasized.

No software currently exists to design specific oligonucleotides starting from a custom set of sequences. Existing tools rely on specific databases, alignments or phylogenetic trees, or cannot accommodate increasingly large molecular environmental datasets.

Different prion strains exhibit well-defined and distinct glycoform preferences arising from two sialylated, N-linked glycans. Glycosylation, and in particular sialylation, have been demonstrated to modulate the replication rate of PrPSc, with profound implications for the propagation of prion diseases.

However, two central questions remain: Does scaling pre-training data reliably improve performance, and do models trained on rank-ordered expression profiles confer advantages for mitigating batch effects? We addressed these questions by systematically assessing transformer-based models pre-trained on ranked single-cell profiles with varying data scales. The models were evaluated on masked gene prediction and downstream tasks, including cell type classification, perturbation response prediction, and zero-shot batch integration. To complement prediction accuracy, we further quantified prediction repetition, uniqueness, and diversity. In addition, we evaluated architectural refinements that incorporate cumulative prediction adjustment and similarity-based regularization; however, the study mainly focused on comparative benchmarks rather than the development of new models. Our results indicated that scaling pretraining corpora improved masked prediction accuracy but did not consistently enhance downstream performance. Smaller models often matched or exceeded larger ones, indicating diminishing returns relative to scale. Rank-based models offered limited robustness to batch effects and consistently underperformed relative to domain-specific correction methods. Across all scales, high redundancy in predicted genes remains a major limitation. Together, these findings challenge assumptions that larger datasets or rank-order modeling automatically confer stronger generalization. Progress in single-cell foundation models may depend less on scale and more on pre-training objectives that enhance predictive diversity and biological plausibility.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

However, nutritional labels on food packaging remain difficult for many consumers to interpret. To improve clarity, public authorities have introduced simplified front-of-pack labeling systems, such as the Health Star Rating (HSR) used in Australia and New Zealand, which summarizes a product's overall nutritional quality. Despite its adoption, the lack of open data on Health Star Rating labeled products limits independent research, reproducibility, and data-driven policy evaluation. Methods: We introduce OpenHSR, the first open, FAIR-compliant dataset (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) dedicated to the Health Star Rating system. The dataset includes 246 unique food products collected from Australian supermarket websites and brand databases. Using these data, we trained and compared several regression models linear, tree-based, and neural approaches to predict Health Star Rating values from nutritional attributes, thereby developing a transparent, interpretable (\"white-box\") Health Star Rating calculator. Results: Machine learning models achieved strong predictive performance, with the Support Vector Regression model yielding the best overall accuracy (Mean Squared Error = 0.28). The trained models were then applied to predict Health Star Rating values for 6,554 Open Food Facts products, demonstrating scalability and generalizability of the approach. Conclusions: OpenHSR provides the first openly available, standardized dataset linking nutritional composition and Health Star Rating values.

The significant role of ephaptic coupling in synchronizing neural ensembles has been conjectured to indirectly affect ontogenetic neural circuit development through sub threshold impacts on spike timing. We therefore hypothesized synchronously firing ensembles to emerge at spatial distances where ephaptic and axonal signals were most temporally correlated. To test our model of ephaptic axonal interactions during neural self-organization, we compared its predictions to developmental outcomes of cortical rat tissue on high-density multielectrode arrays in vitro. We observed a cosinusoidal variation of synchronous activity over radial distances that can be understood to result from the joint effects of ephaptic and axonal signals during gamma-band bursts. Recurrent amplification of this theorized interaction effect during ontogenetic differentiation appears to radially bias the spectral profile of neural activity in the spatial distribution of neural ensembles.

However, diversification is also influenced by ecological feedback mechanisms - such as frequency-dependent resource use - and their interaction with migration. To investigate how spatial variation affects diversification, we conducted an evolution experiment exposing populations of Lactococcus cremoris to divergent selection on two carbon sources: fructose and galactose. Using a continuous culture system, we partitioned these resources into two isolated patches (allopatry), two patches with constant migration between them (parapatry), and one fully-mixed patch (sympatry). Resource specialization and subsequent phenotypic diversification evolved in all treatments, revealing a metabolic trade-off between fructose and galactose utilization. Compared to treatments without migration, spatial variation produced a distinctive temporal pattern: migration initially delayed specialization on galactose but later accelerated it. This temporal pattern emerged from eco-evolutionary feedbacks operating through two mechanisms: (i) early in the experiment, higher population density in the better-suited fructose patch increased the influx of maladapted immigrants into the galactose patch, slowing local adaptation; however, (ii) as strains adapted locally to galactose, population density increased in the galactose patch and density asymmetries weakened. Simultaneously, the competitive ability of immigrants declined as residents became increasingly specialized in their local resources, progressively reducing the effective migration rate and allowing accelerated divergence. Our experiment demonstrates how the likelihood and tempo of spatial divergence depend on the evolvability of phenotypic trade-offs and their dynamic interaction with migration load and population density.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Parallel genetic signatures of exaggeration of SAC traits should be observed, but due to a poor knowledge of genes underlying SAC traits this remains untested, impeding understanding of how SAC shapes genetic variation and the phenotypic consequences5,6. Here we show the first evidence that SAC theory readily extends to the molecular level and classic patterns of phenotypic SAC are recapitulated. We exploit the iconic sex-peptide (SP) network in Drosophila melanogaster, which comprises male seminal fluid proteins and female reproductive tract proteins that interact to influence sexually antagonistic female post-mating behaviours7,8. Using genomic data from ~150 populations9,10, we show that genetic differentiation at loci of the male- and female- components of the SP-network loci co-vary as expected under SAC. We use relative levels of genetic differentiation between male- and female- components of the SP-network to infer which sex has the advantage in mating interactions. Mating and survival assays using populations established from wild-derived isofemale lines11 show populations with inferred male-advantage have reduced female remating and earlier peaks of egg production compared to populations with inferred female-advantage. Thus, relative levels of genetic differentiation in the classic SP-network with known SAC phenotypes accurately predicts outcomes of mating interactions within populations.

However, the mechanisms underlying parallel adaptation to contrasting edaphic extremes within a single species remain poorly understood. Firmiana danxiaensis, an endangered tree endemic to both KL and DL in the Nanling Mountains, offers a rare opportunity to address this question. We integrated a chromosome-level genome assembly, population genomic analysis of 225 individuals from 20 populations across its entire range, and genotype-environment association (GEA) with high-resolution soil and climate data. The relatively large genome of F. danxiaensis (1.51 Gb) reveals two ancient whole-genome duplications and a Quaternary burst of LTR retrotransposons, which, together with significant expanded drought-related transcription factor (TF) families, together constitute its genomic basis of adaptation. Population structure resolved four genetic lineages with distinct demography and inbreeding patterns. GEA identified stronger local adaptation in DL than KL, driven mainly by soil factors (e.g., cadmium, zinc), while climate variables (e.g., Bio9, Bio11) predominated in KL. Despite these divergent drivers, drought stress and elevated metal ion acted as major selective pressures in both landforms. Furthermore, six key TFs (e.g., NAC090, bHLH42, MAPKKK20) under both local adaptation and positive selection in DL are involved in drought response and metal ion binding, facilitating survival in stressful habitats.

It is also well-suited to human microbiome studies, where the data are highly skewed, overdispersed, discrete, and irregular. Here, I pay particular attention to the phylogenetic tree information that reflects evolutionary ancestry and functional relatedness among microbial features. Proper incorporation of phylogenetic tree information into microbiome data analysis has provided new insights and improved analytical performance. In this paper, I introduce an extension of the Random Forest algorithm that incorporates phylogenetic tree information, named Phylogeny-Informed Random Forests (PIRF), to improve predictive accuracy in human microbiome studies. The core mechanism of PIRF lies in its localized approach; rather than treating all features as competing globally to be selected or weighted, PIRF identifies informative features within each phylogenetic cluster (i.e., a localized group of microbial features that are evolutionarily and functionally related), thereby enriching functional representations while reducing tree correlation. I demonstrate the high predictive accuracy of PIRF, compared with other off-the-shelf tools, across seven benchmark tasks: four classification problems (gingival inflammation, immunotherapy response, type 1 diabetes, and obesity) and three regression problems (cytokine level, age based on oral microbiome, and age based on gut microbiome).

Here, we present a systematic benchmark of nine methods across 20 monomeric proteins with active and inactive states. We extend the pairwise aligned error metric to ensembles and reveal that protein identity exerts a non-negligible influence on model performance. Focusing on Adenylate Kinase, a well-studied enzyme with extensive molecular dynamics (MD) data, we find that Chai-1 performs the best in recovering known conformations, identifying mobile regions, and capturing transition trajectories. These results highlight the potential of generative models as efficient alternatives to MD for exploring protein conformational dynamics and provide a rigorous benchmark for dynamic structure prediction.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Substantial heterogeneity exists among databases in sequence coverage, curation standards, and taxonomic nomenclature, leading to conflicting taxonomic assignments. Despite previous comparisons highlighting performance differences, the impact of database preprocessing, including sequence cleaning and redundancy removal, on taxonomic classification remains understudied. To improve database quality, we implemented novel cleaning approaches to remove nested sequences, duplicate sequences, and correct missing taxonomic nomenclature. We compared four major 16S databases (SILVA, Greengenes2, RefSeq, and MIMt) using 69 mock communities and the DADA2 analysis pipeline for microbial genus-level profiling. Database size was significantly reduced after cleaning: SILVA reduced from 452,055 to 291,733 sequences, Greengenes2 from 337,506 to 277,982 sequences, MIMt from 48,749 to 34,734 sequences, and RefSeq from 27,376 to 25,970 sequences. Greengenes2, MIMt, and RefSeq, which exhibited comparable performance, consistently outperformed SILVA in recall, precision, and abundance estimation accuracy across all sample types. Cleaning SILVA improved computational efficiency by up to 50% while maintaining classification performance.

A.", "abstract": "Differential abundance (DA) analysis is critical in metagenomics research for identifying microbial taxa associated with variable biological conditions. Despite numerous mature DA tools being available, they often generate disparate results, making it challenging to obtain consistent and biologically meaningful findings. Tools differ substantially in their input requirements, underlying statistical models, and filtering strategies, yet researchers typically rely on a single tool due to the practical challenges of integrating multiple algorithms with variable workflows and non-standardized output formats. To address this challenge, we developed ConsensusMetaDA, an easy-to-use R package that integrates five widely-used DA tools (ALDEx2, DESeq2, EdgeR, metagenomeSeq, and ADAPT) into a streamlined three-function workflow. The package generates unified output reports and comprehensive visualizations including rarefaction curves, alpha/beta diversity analyses, taxonomic abundance plots, and Venn/UpSet diagrams to visualize algorithmic consensus and disagreement. We benchmarked ConsensusMetaDA on well-characterized public datasets and simulated data, demonstrating that individual tools exhibit complementary strengths and weaknesses. On datasets with known null results, EdgeR and DESeq2 reported false positive differentially abundant OTUs while ALDEx2, metagenomeSeq, and ADAPT correctly identified none. Conversely, simulations revealed that ALDEx2, metagenomeSeq, and ADAPT frequently missed true positives that EdgeR and DESeq2 detected. Our consensus approach improves both sensitivity and specificity compared to any single tool and enables researchers to minimize either false positive or false negative rates based on study-specific priorities.

While motif identification is critical for protein study, experimental methods are labor-intensive, only a few hundred motifs are cataloged in databases like ELM, and existing supervised models are typically limited to predicting motifs with a specific function. Here, we present MotifAE, an unsupervised framework for discovering functional motifs from the protein language model ESM2, which captures evolutionary-scale sequence regularities. MotifAE is based on the sparse autoencoder (SAE), an encoder-decoder architecture that projects ESM2 embeddings into a sparse latent space, with an additional local similarity loss that encourages coherent latent feature activations. When benchmarked against known ELM motifs, MotifAE achieves a median AUROC of 0.88, outperforming the standard SAE (0.80). We also calculated Position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for MotifAE features and found that features with similar decoder weights share similar PSSMs. Furthermore, by aligning MotifAE features with experimental data through gated feature selection, we identified features associated with specific properties such as folding stability. Steering these features enabled designing proteins with enhanced stability, as evaluated in silico. Overall, MotifAE provides a general framework for systematic motif discovery and interpretation, with the potential to advance protein function analysis, mutation effect interpretation, and rational protein engineering.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Recently, we discovered the Lrrc55, an auxiliary subunit of the voltage- and calcium-activated potassium channel (BK channel), is a prosurvival factor in {beta}-cell, and its expression and highly and specifically up regulated in the pancreatic islets during pregnancy. We found that overexpression of Lrrc55 protects {beta}-cells from glucolipotoxicity (GLT)-induced apoptosis. The protective effect of Lrrc55 is associated with dampening of the ER stress response and preservation of the releasable pool of calcium in the ER. Thus, we hypothesized that Lrrc55 protects {beta}-cells from GLT-induced ER stress and apoptosis by regulating ER calcium handling. Here, we report that Lrrc55 restored the GLT-mediated decrease in expression levels the insulin regulators, Pdx-1 and MafA, as well as the ER calcium regulator SERCA. Lrrc55 also attenuated the GLT-induced increase in expression of the ER calcium channel RyR2. Lrrc55 also attenuated GLT-mediated increase in protein expression of pro-apoptotic molecules CHOP and IRE1, and increased activation of the anti-apoptotic molecule Akt. However, Lrrc55 does not alter the activity levels of SERCA or IP3R under physiologic conditions. Transgenic mice with global deletion of Lrrc55 (Lrrc55-/-) are more susceptible to streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Surprisingly, Lrrc55-/- mice are more glucose tolerant and secreted more insulin during pregnancy. Together, these results suggest a role for Lrrc55 in maintaining expression of the ER calcium regulators in the presence of GLT but it may negatively regulate insulin secretion.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

However, the toxicity of F-53B to reproductive system in plants remains unelucidated. In this study, by using cytogenetic and microscopic approaches, we analyzed embryo and anther development and multiple meiosis processes in Arabidopsis exposed to 50 or 100 M F-53B. We showed that F-53B disrupts embryo development which results in reduced seed setting in Arabidopsis. Histochemical staining of anthers and a live-imaging assay using a reporter line that expresses GFP-tagged Aborted Microspores (AMS), a key regulator of the tapetum, demonstrated that F-53B impairs anther development. Moreover, we showed that F-53B interferes with chromosome segregation and/or distribution and alters microtubule organization during male meiosis. Quantification of the chiasmata and immunolocalization of the Human Enhancer of Invasion 10 (HEI10) protein on diakinesis chromosomes suggested that F-53B reduces crossover rate. Furthermore, F-53B reduced the number of DNA Meiotic Recombinase 1 (DMC1) protein foci on zygotene chromosomes in Arabidopsis wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0), and it partially promoted meiotic chromosome integrity in Arabidopsis depleted with Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM), a central regulator of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair, which suggested that F-53B reduces meiotic DSB formation.

During infection the brain triggers conserved behaviors, including fever, tiredness and anorexia that support immunity. The immune system stores infection information via adaptive immunity, however it remains unclear whether the brain stores immune-related information as long-term memory engrams. Here we demonstrate that mice form contextual memories for sickness events. Upon sickness-memory recall mice lower whole-body metabolism, and increase coactivation between the hippocampus and sickness regions such as the central amygdala, alongside elevated engram activation. Optogenetic reactivation of sickness engrams decreases metabolism, similar to natural recall. Finally, natural recall and artificial reactivation of a sickness-memory increased genes associated with the acute phase response in the liver.

Going beyond CBF, CCSI selectively tracked mitochondrial respiratory capacity and colocalized with capillary endothelial and mature non-myelination oligodendrocyte populations forming neurovascular interfaces. Transcriptomic enrichment highlighted pathways related to vascular remodeling, oxidative metabolism, and lipid-myelin homeostasis, indicating that CCSI reflects integrated metabolic-structural specialization. At the systems level, CCSI strengthened structure-function gradient correspondence in transmodal cortices, such as the default mode network.

These large membrane protein complexes control the movement of sodium ions across cell membranes and are responsible for initiating and propagating action potentials. A desire to better understand the role of Nav subtypes in electrical signal conduction and the relationship between channel dysregulation and specific human pathologies (e.g., epilepsy, musculoskeletal disorders, neuropathic pain) motivates the development of high-precision pharmacological reagents to facilitate Nav studies. Investigations of Nav physiology and nerve cell conduction are limited by a lack of available methods with which to modulate acutely and reversibly the function of individual channel subtypes. Moreover, discriminating between Navs expressed in different cell types is not possible even with potent and selective ligands that target specific channel homologues. We have capitalized on both chemical design and protein engineering to advance a chemogenetic tool to inhibit a single Nav isoform. A synthetic derivative of the bis-guanidinium toxin saxitoxin (STX) is paired with two unique outer pore-forming amino acid mutations to achieve ~100:1 selectivity for the engineered channel over wild-type Nav1.1-1.4, 1.6, and 1.7. The designer ligand is nanomolar potent against the mutant channel and acts within seconds to block sodium ion conduction; washing cells with buffer solution rapidly and completely restores channel function. This technology will empower studies of Nav physiology and have additional applications for manipulating action potential signals given the requisite role of Navs in electrogenesis.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

In a previous study, we demonstrated the pro-depressive roles of SIRT1 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) using the chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) model, a well-validated preclinical mouse model of depression. We found that SIRT1 modulates synaptic functions and exhibits pro-susceptible effects specifically in D1-medium spiny neurons in the NAc. In this study, we extended our investigation of SIRT1 functions by employing cell-type-specific transcriptomics to compare control and susceptible groups under CSDS. Our results revealed that in wild-type mice with functional SIRT1, cellular metabolism is crucial for inducing susceptibility to depression. Conversely, in the absence of functional SIRT1 expression, circadian clock-controlled transcriptional regulation becomes a key factor. These findings suggest that SIRT1 differentially modulates key pathophysiological mechanisms of depression via its deacetylase functions, highlighting its role in both metabolic and circadian regulation in the brain.

Differences in hippocampal genetics, anatomy, and connectivity across the longitudinal axis suggest functional heterogeneity in this structure. The dorsal pole is suggested to be primarily involved in spatial processing, whereas the ventral pole is implicated in emotional processing. Connectivity and genetic studies show this functional segregation is more prominent near their respective poles and weaker toward the intermediate region. The current study compares the firing properties of CA1 cells in the dorsal and intermediate regions of the hippocampus during spatial or social/odor novelty. We measured basic spatial properties, firing rate response, and remapping to the spatial re-configuration of a linear track or the social/odor presentation of a novel male conspecific, female bedding, or coyote urine. Behaviorally, the average rat exhibited slower maze running latencies during the novel spatial manipulation and spent more time adjacent to the chamber containing the novel social/odor stimulus. As previously shown, dorsal cells had fewer, smaller place fields, and higher spatial information content than intermediate cells in the hippocampus. Despite the differences in place field characteristics, cells in both regions responded similarly to spatial and social/odor manipulations. Taken together, these data support the differentiation of some functions, together with an overlap of other functions progressing along the longitudinal axis, which may facilitate the integration of information throughout the hippocampus.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

We recently demonstrated that dermal lymphatic capillaries regulate antigen presentation in lymph nodes (LN) by restraining fluid and virion transport following vaccinia virus (VACV) infection by skin scarification. Concurrently, a perifollicular, LN lymphangiogenic response encapsulates expanding B cell follicles. Given the important role of antigen transport and uptake on humoral immunity, we tested the hypothesis that lymphatic remodeling in the skin and LNs regulates germinal center (GC)- dependent antibody responses during infection. Using a model of lymphatic-specific VEGFR2 inhibition, we found that inhibiting viral-induced lymphatic remodeling in skin and LNs prompted significant GC expansion but paradoxically decreases protective VACV-specific class-switched antibodies. While the larger GC responses appeared structurally normal, they failed to support a proliferative burst consistent with clonal selection. Mathematical modeling revealed that this disconnect between GC size and function arises from impaired productive T follicular cell interactions in larger GC volumes and consistent with this finding, the optimal GC size was evolutionarily conserved across diverse mammals. Finally, we found that the presence of virus in the LN initiates these changes in GC function, inhibits LN lymphangiogenesis, increases B cell follicle size, and reduces selection efficiency. Therefore, protecting LN lymphatic vessels from virus-induced interferons rescues perifollicular lymphatic growth and follicle size, indicating that LN lymphangiogenesis directly constrains the follicular response. In summary, this study underscores the central role of lymphatic remodeling in compartmentalizing antigen and inflammatory signals to optimize GC fitness and protective antibody responses.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Employing an unbiased transcriptomic analysis, we aimed to comprehensively elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these drug effects. We also sought to determine whether rapamycin, especially in combination with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib, can reduce lesion volume even after lesion growth has occurred. Approach and Results: Mouse Brain Microvascular Endothelial Cells (mBMEC) deficient in Ccm3 were treated with propranolol (10 uM) or rapamycin (100 nM) and were analyzed by RNA-seq and immunofluorescence. Ccm3-null mice in which cavernoma development had been induced were treated with rapamycin alone or combined with lapatinib, assessing lesion volume using micro-CT imaging. While propranolol shows limited efficacy in modulating the CCM transcriptomic phenotype in mBMEC, rapamycin demonstrates a significant impact. Rapamycin reverses gene expression changes induced by Ccm3 deficiency, restoring Klf2/4-dependent genes like Nos3, Adamts1, and Thbs1. Notably, we observed a reduction in KLF2 protein levels in Ccm3 KO cells treated with rapamycin. Critically, in vivo experiments demonstrate that a combination of rapamycin and lapatinib effectively reduces lesion volume in a chronic CCM model. Conclusion: Rapamycin normalizes the expression of key genes implicated in cavernoma pathogenesis in Ccm3 KO endothelial cells, offering new insights into its potential therapeutic mechanisms. In contrast, the observed lack of efficacy of propranolol in brain endothelial cells challenges current understanding of its mechanism of action in CCM treatment and warrants further investigation. Significantly, rapamycin, when combined with lapatinib, exhibits promising efficacy in vivo by reducing the volume of established CCM lesions. This finding is particularly noteworthy as it suggests a potential treatment strategy for existing lesions.

Our recent study has revealed a striking spatial organization in the nucleus during the repression phase: core clock proteins such as Drosophila PERIOD (PER) are organized into distinct nuclear foci close to the inner nuclear envelope of clock neurons, and clock-regulated genes are similarly positioned in the nucleus. However, the functional relevance of this subnuclear organization is unknown. Here, we investigate how the spatial organization of clock proteins and chromatin regulates circadian gene repression. Given that PER partners with TIMELESS (TIM) to enact transcriptional repression, we first investigated whether TIM is also a component of these nuclear foci. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to endogenously tag TIM with mNeonGreen, we performed high-resolution live imaging in Drosophila clock neurons. We found that TIM forms nuclear foci during the repression phase that co-localize with PER condensates, whereas TIM remains diffuse in the cytoplasm of per01 null mutants. To probe the spatial relationship between these condensates and clock-regulated genes, we combined protein imaging with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) which revealed that PER/TIM condensates were positioned adjacent to, but did not overlap with, clock gene loci during the repression phase. These results suggest that core clock proteins are spatially sequestered into repressive condensates away from chromatin, providing a new framework for understanding how nuclear architecture and phase separation together orchestrate rhythmic gene expression.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

T.; Feldmann, M.; Yu, H.; Cheng, H.", "abstract": "Methods to predict the heritable component of phenotypes from genetic markers, collectively known as genomic prediction, have been widely applied in plant and animal breeding and in human genetics. Currently, genomic prediction is limited to numeric phenotypes. In some cases, though, plant and animal phenotypes are better understood through images and text rather than numbers. The current best practice for incorporating images and text in genomic prediction is to first extract scalar numeric phenotypes from images and text, and then to perform genomic prediction on the numeric phenotypes. While this approach is effective for some traits, it involves discarding most of the information in the image or text, including potentially useful information. Additionally, numeric phenotypes derived from images and text may not be as interpretable as the images and text themselves. We present a novel approach for predicting images and text from SNP markers, which we refer to as end-to-end genomic prediction, and validate this approach using genotypes, text, and image phenotypes derived from a strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) diversity panel. Our approach combines nonlinear latent space encoding with linear genomic prediction to generate accurate breeding values for a high-dimensional phenotype, for example, images or text. For both genome-to-image and genome-to-text prediction, we found that predicting images and text and then extracting numeric traits from them was in some cases as accurate as directly predicting extracted numeric phenotypes, demonstrating for the first time that genome-to-image prediction accuracy can be comparable to conventional genomic prediction accuracy. Based on our proof-of-concept using the same core end-to-end method in both images and text, we believe end-to-end could be of use in a wide range of visual and non-standardized phenotypes in plants and animals, although further work to improve the accuracy of the embedding and genomic prediction steps is needed.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Consequently, generation of lymphatic vessels has been postulated as an innovative therapeutic strategy for various diseases. However, there is a lack of efficient and reliable method to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) for lymphatic regeneration. Current differentiation methods suffer from poor yield and low lymphatic marker expression, while also having limited clinical applicability due to its reliance on either the embryoid body intermediates or xenogenic supporting cells. Here, we develop a stepwise differentiation method that relies on fully defined treatment with sodium acetate, a metabolite resulting from fatty acid oxidation, along with VEGF-C, that yields high expression of lymphatic marker and retain the functionality of native LECs. We show that differentiated LECs (dLEC) express comparable levels of lymphatic markers compared to native LECs, which is up to 15 times higher than the current leading standard of dLECs. We also show that the dLECs can form lymphatic vascular networks in 2D and 3D and secrete important lymphangiocrine for organ maturation. Upon implantation into murine lymphedema models, dLECs were able to integrate with the host lymphatic vessels, restore fluid flow, and reduce swelling. In conclusion, our functional dLECs can be incorporated into novel tissue engineering applications in personalized therapies and disease modeling, as well as provide a direct therapeutic option for lymphedema and lymphatic disorders.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

The approach treats image pixels as information-carrying entities analogous to gas molecules, where pixel intensities represent energy states and spatial relationships correspond to intermolecular forces. The framework integrates three primary computational modules: Gas Molecular Dynamics for thermodynamic foundation and structural segmentation, S-Entropy Coordinate System for four-dimensional semantic representation, and Meta-Information Extraction for high-level biological interpretation. The Gas Molecular Dynamics module converts biological image features into information gas molecules with thermodynamic properties including position, velocity, mass, and interaction parameters. Molecular evolution follows classical dynamics principles through modified Lennard-Jones potentials that incorporate biological similarity factors. The system evolves toward equilibrium configurations that reveal underlying biological organization through emergent clustering patterns. TheS-Entropy Coordinate System transforms conventional spatial coordinates into entropy based coordinates capturing structural complexity ({xi}1), functional activity ({xi}2), morphological diversity ({xi}3), and temporal dynamics ({xi}4). This four-dimensional representation enables quantitative analysis of biological patterns through thermodynamically motivated measures while providing semantic interpretation of biological organization. The Meta-Information Extraction framework analyzes information content and compression characteristics through automated classification of information types, semantic density analysis, and structural complexity quantification. Integration with molecular dynamics and S-Entropy coordinates enables multi-scale analysis combining detailed molecular configurations with abstracted coordinate representations. Experimental validation demonstrates significant performance improvements through module integration compared to isolated operation. Molecular dynamics clustering accuracy increases from 0.73 plus/minus 0.08 to 0.89 plus/minus 0.05, S-Entropy semantic classification improves from 0.67 plus/minus 0.12 to 0.84 plus/minus 0.07, and meta-information extraction accuracy advances from 0.58 plus/minus 0.15 to 0.91 plus/minus 0.04, representing a 57% improvement. Computational efficiency gains of approximately 35% are achieved through unified thermodynamic representation and elimination of redundant calculations. The framework is applied to fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy data, demonstrating specialized analysis capabilities including multi-channel colocalization analysis, time-series processing, ultrastructural classification, and morphological characterization. The thermodynamic approach provides both theoretical rigor through adherence to physical principles and practical improvements in analytical performance for life sciences applications. The cross-module integration achieves effectiveness through synergistic interactions where each component amplifies the analytical capabilities of others. The molecular dynamics module provides thermodynamic foundation, the S-Entropy system integrates molecular information into semantic representations, and meta-information extraction synthesizes multi-scale insights for biological interpretation. This work establishes thermodynamic principles as a viable framework for biological image analysis with quantifiable improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Protein-O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) is increasingly recognized as an oncogenic driver in CRC, but the upstream regulatory mechanisms responsible for its overexpression remain poorly understood. Objective: We aimed to identify a reproducible miRNA signature potentially regulating POFUT1 in colon cancer by combining multiple computational approaches and intersecting their outcomes to retain the most significant candidates and to validate biologically the most promising miRNA to confirm its regulatory potential. Methods: We implemented an integrative, multi-step bioinformatics framework that combined multiple linear regression with stepwise selection, penalized regression models (LASSO and Elastic Net), and Random Forest analysis for non-linear feature evaluation. miRNAs showing a consistent inverse association with POFUT1 across these complementary methods were retained as final candidates. The most significant miRNA was then validated in vitro by mimic transfection, real-time quantitative PCR, and dual-luciferase reporter assays performed in colon cancer cell lines. Results: Five miRNAs (miR-92b, miR-484, miR-574, miR-642a, and miR-3940) were consistently identified as negative contributors to POFUT1 expression across all analytical approaches. Among these, miR-642a exhibited the strongest negative correlation (r = - 0.44) with POFUT1. It was therefore selected for biological validation to confirm its regulatory interaction. Overexpression of miR-642a-5p through mimic transfection significantly reduced POFUT1 transcript levels by approximately 46 % in HCT 116, 50 % in SW480, and 22 % in SW620 cells compared with controls. Dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed direct binding of miR-642a-5p to two predicted sites within the POFUT1-3'UTR, resulting in a decrease of luciferase activity by 40-50 %. Conclusion: This study combines bioinformatics screening based on multiple linear regression and machine learning models, with experimental validation to identify miRNAs regulating POFUT1 expression in colon cancer. This integrative strategy allows the identification of a miRNA signature related to POFUT1 and provides novel insights into its post-transcriptional control. It may serve as a foundation for future diagnostic or therapeutic strategies in CRC.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

A.; Kumar, A.", "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a malignant soft tissue sarcoma with a skeletal muscle phenotype, accounting for approximately 50% of all pediatric soft tissue sarcomas and 8% of all childhood cancers. Although RMS cells express myogenic regulatory factors, they fail to undergo terminal differentiation into mature muscle cells. Transforming growth factor {beta}-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a major signaling protein that activates multiple intracellular pathways in response to growth factors, cytokines, and microbial products. Emerging evidence suggests that TAK1 is also an important regulator of self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation of muscle progenitor cells. However, the role and mechanisms of action of TAK1 in RMS remain completely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that TAK1 expression and activity are markedly elevated in a panel of RMS cell lines and in patient tumor specimens. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analyses revealed that TAK1 regulates the expression and activity of many molecules involved in cell cycle control, cell proliferation, and oncogenic signaling. Genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of TAK1 suppresses RMS cell proliferation, migration, and invasiveness, while also promoting terminal myogenic differentiation. TAK1 inhibits differentiation in RMS, at least in part, through up-regulating YAP1 signaling. Our results also demonstrate that inducible knockdown of TAK1 in human RMS xenografts retards tumor growth and enhances myogenic differentiation in vivo. Collectively, these findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for TAK1 in RMS growth and differentiation, and suggest that TAK1 can be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of RMS.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Various carriers or associated nanoparticles have been studied with Cisplatin, primarily using in vitro models. In this context, Drosophila melanogaster serves as a valuable alternative model for evaluating the toxicity of numerous substances and studying diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's, and alcoholism. This work investigates the in vivo effects of orally administered Cisplatin (50 g/ml) and titanium dioxide (NPTiO2; 50 g/ml), alone and in combination, in D. melanogaster. Using RNA-seq and bioinformatics studies, we analyzed gene modulation to assess the toxic effects in each administration group. We found that flies treated with either Cisplatin or NPTiO2 alone exhibited gene modulation related to drug and non-toxic substance processing. However, the group treated with Cisplatin and TiO2 nanoparticles showed decrease in expression levels, a small number of DEGs, and a disruption in cell division processes and DNA/RNA metabolism. Mortality rates remained statistically unchanged across all experimental groups. These findings suggest that co-exposure to Cisplatin and TiO2; nanoparticles leads to transcriptional repression and disruption of essential cellular pathways, indicating potential impairments in cellular function.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

In the present study, using heterospheroids consisting of cancer cells and macrophages, we identified TAM activators, which are compounds that reprogram M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward the antitumor M1-like phenotype. THP-1- or human peripheral monocyte-derived macrophages were co-cultured with liver cancer cells in an ultra-low attachment dish to generate heterospheroids. Cell surface marker expression and macrophage infiltration into the heterospheroids were assessed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-{gamma} (IFN{gamma})-induced M1 marker expression was observed on the macrophages in the homospheroids; however, this induction was suppressed in heterospheroids. Microscopic imaging revealed that macrophage infiltration into the heterospheroids was decreased in the presence of LPS and IFN{gamma}, which prompted us to develop a high-content imaging screen. We identified two compounds [alprostadil (prostaglandin E1) and HX531] with TAM-activating activity. RNA-seq analysis revealed that HX531 modulated the immune and IFN response in cancer cells and cell division in macrophages. Moreover, alprostadil promoted the M1-like polarization of TAMs, increased tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, and enhanced anti-PD-1 antibody therapeutic efficacy in a syngeneic mouse xenograft model. In conclusion, the heterospheroid culture recapitulates the immunosuppressive TME, which prevents the M1 polarization of TAMs. It provides a new platform for screening TAM activators and will enable the development of novel cancer immunotherapeutics when combined with high-content imaging analysis.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

However, crop improvement programs typically only focus on individual crop performance rather than system-wide benefits. We propose a novel approach: breeding pulses and cereals to optimize rotational effects and enhance farming system sustainability in addition to crop-specific traits. In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated how genetically diverse mungbeans influence subsequent wheat performance. A mini-core panel of 309 mungbean accessions was grown at a nitrogen depleted site, followed by a single wheat cultivar sown in the same plot locations. Remarkably, wheat yield ranged from 2.51 to 3.49 t ha-1 and displayed moderate broad-sense heritability (H2: 0.42) as a trait of the proceeding mungbean genotype. This variation demonstrates untapped genetic potential for breeding mungbean varieties that enhance subsequent wheat performance. Integrated analyses of mungbean-wheat traits, soil properties, and microbiome composition revealed mechanisms underlying these rotational relationships. Haplotype mapping identified genomic regions in mungbean associated with wheat yield and quality. To explore how legacy traits could be leveraged in breeding programs, we conducted forward genetic simulations using empirically derived haplotype effects to compare strategies targeting mungbean yield, wheat yield, or both simultaneously. These simulations reveal both challenges and opportunities in breeding crops collectively for rotational benefits, offering a pathway toward more sustainable and profitable farming systems with reduced input requirements.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Spittlebugs (Hemiptera: Cercopidae) are major pests of tropical Urochloa (syn. Brachiaria) pastures, severely reducing forage productivity and quality.

Here, we combined high-throughput image-based phenotyping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to dissect the genetic architecture of tolerance to Aeneolamia varia nymphs in 339 interspecific F1 hybrids derived from crosses between resistant sexual and susceptible apomictic Urochloa parents. Digital image analysis using both unsupervised (DQU) and supervised (DTR) quantification pipelines enabled precise estimation of plant damage, yielding moderate to high broad-sense heritability estimates (H = 0.49-0.66). In contrast, insect survival (NTS) exhibited low to moderate correlations with all damage traits and lower heritability estimates (H = 0.42). Using 57,051 high-quality SNPs aligned to the genome of the hybrid cultivar Basilisk, GWAS models identified 18 quantitative trait loci (QTL) for plant damage traits, but none for insect survival (antibiosis). Six robust QTL on chromosomes 1, 6, 7, 27, 29, and 36 were consistently detected across models and phenotyping methods, explaining up to 21.5% of phenotypic variance.

Leukocytes including hemosiderophages, neutrophils and accumulation of macrophages all displayed time-dependent infiltration into the wound bed. CD34 showed no time-dependent expression.

Notably, F-actin was decreased at the ciliary base, suggesting that a different F-actin subpopulation contributes to the inverse relationship. We also identified a genetic interaction between Specc1l and Thm1, which encodes an intraflagellar transport-A (IFT-A) protein. Double or compound heterozygotes for Specc1l and Thm1 exhibited a higher penetrance of cleft palate compared to Specc1l heterozygotes alone. Together, these findings reveal a role for SPECC1L in cytoskeletal regulation of ciliogenesis affecting palate development.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Hi-C provides genome-wide chromatin conformation information, but its contact maps are population-averaged, distance-biased, and noisy, obscuring the biologically specific contacts. We present CHROME, a framework built on a self-avoiding polymer ensemble null model that identifies physically specific, non-random Hi-C contacts. By integrating these contacts into graph representations, CHROME enables efficient information transfer across spatially connected loci. It integrates sequence, chromatin accessibility, or pre-trained embeddings into a graph attention architecture to predict cell line-specific ChIP-seq profiles, consistently outperforming local encoder baselines and generalizing to an unseen cell line. The resulting graph embeddings also enhance prediction on tissue-specific eQTL and ClinVar variant pathogenicity, outperforming local sequence-based embeddings. Beyond predictive performance, CHROME provides interpretability through attention-derived neighbor-to-center contributions that reveal how spatially connected loci influence local regulatory activity over multi-megabase distances. Together, these results show that incorporating physically validated chromatin interactions enables more accurate and interpretable modeling of gene regulation and variant effects.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Interleukin 11 (IL-11), a gp130-family cytokine, has emerged as a pivotal inflammaging mediator: Its genetic or pharmacological inhibition extends mouse median lifespan by 22.5% in males and 25% in females, with enhanced healthspan benefits in the latter [20-29]. Here, we propose that estrogen's direct suppression of IL-11 transcription via estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha)-mediated interference with NF-kappa B/AP-1 on the IL-11 promoter in osteoblasts, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells establishes a premenopausal \"hormonal firewall\" against IL-11-driven senescence and multi-organ fibrosis [0-9]. In contrast, testosterone exhibits neutral or permissive effects, correlating with elevated IL-11 in hyperandrogenic states like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) [30-40]. To test this, we developed an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model integrating IL-11 dynamics with upstream triggers (e.g., Ang II, c-Myc/miR-23 derepression) and suppressors (SIRT1 deacetylates IL-11 promoter histones; p53 represses IL-11/c-Myc; NRF2 quenches NF-kappa B) [10, 12]. In persistent inflammaging simulations (impaired degradation, k_deg=0.1), high estrogen (1.0 arbitrary units) reduced steady-state IL-11 by 63% (179.96 to 65.77 at t=20 days), cascading to 40-50% lower STAT3/NF-kappa B activation and triad cytokines (TNF-alpha/IL-6/IL-1beta). [11,13]. Synergy with high SIRT1/p53/NRF2 amplified suppression to [~]74% for IL-11 [16,17]. Post-menopausal estrogen decline erodes this buffer, but cumulative pre-menopausal protection persists, explaining sustained sex gaps post-65. [32,34]. This framework predicts estrogen replacement therapy (HRT) could mitigate inflammaging equitably, narrowing longevity disparities. [35]. Validation via sex-stratified IL-11 cohorts and HRT-fibrosis trials is warranted, positioning IL-11 as a sex-specific therapeutic nexus.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Plant temperature regulation, photosynthesis and therefore production are exposed. As with drought, species diversity could buffer the negative effects of heatwaves. Our main objective was to test the effect of diversity on grassland responses to heatwaves by comparing mixtures with monocultures. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to simulate four thermo-protocols: i) control ii) two mild heatwaves, iii) a severe heatwave, and iv) recurrent scenario with mild and severe heatwaves. We analyzed production at mowing time, resistance and recovery of species calculated from shoot growth, and foliar parameters sensitive to heatwaves such as leaf temperature and maximum quantum efficiency of Photosystem II. A severe heatwave induced negative effects on production and leaf parameters, whereas mild heatwaves not. Recurrent heatwaves induced negative cumulative effects on production and acclimation of Photosystem II. In this context, mixtures were more productive than monocultures average, as overyielding; certain species showed higher resistance or recovery in mixtures than in monocultures; but there was no diversity effect on leaf parameters. Our results suggest that leaf parameters alone cannot reflect the resilience of plants exposed to heat and that plant diversity can give temperate grasslands a higher capacity to cope with heatwaves.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we present CycleVI, a deep generative model that disentangles cell cycle variation from all other transcriptional signals in static scRNA-seq data by learning a partitioned latent representation with a dedicated circular subspace. CycleVI infers a continuous cell cycle phase, validated against orthogonal protein-level measurements, and produces a residual latent space free from cell cycle artifacts. We demonstrate that this disentangled representation unmasks meaningful biological heterogeneity in cancer cells and clarifies complex differentiation trajectories in hematopoietic progenitors. Furthermore, by applying CycleVI to spatially resolved transcriptomics data from a human breast cancer biopsy, we map proliferative activity in situ, revealing a clear demarcation between cycling tumor regions and surrounding quiescent tissue. CycleVI provides a principled approach to isolating, rather than removing, confounding cell cycle-related variation from widely available scRNA-seq data, enabling more robust analyses of cellular heterogeneity.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Additionally, predictive tools for the analysis of different strains in a systematic framework are limited. Here, we reconstructed genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of 44 Pseudomonas strains from various environments and investigated their capabilities to metabolize different carbon sources and metabolic intermediaries. By systematically testing the substrate utilization of the models, we demonstrate how GEM-predicted capabilities can differentiate between strains and that high metabolic versatility is associated with the ability of the strains to remove toxic compounds while maintaining core functionalities. Hundreds of model simulations were used as input for a classification schema that uses machine learning algorithms, resulting in the identification of metabolic capabilities that better differentiate between species.

To address these challenges, we propose a versatile image analysis approach that accurately detects yeast cell division events. To reduce the burden of requiring a large cell division annotated dataset, we pretrained a Masked Auto-Encoder on large-scale segmented yeast cell images. This substantially reduced the annotated data needed to train the transformer model for detecting cellular division events. Additionally, the model is trained directly on budding event detection, circumventing reliance on arbitrary heuristics, such as changes in cell area.

To address these hurdles, we utilized a chemical genetic-based screening approach to adapt the Connectivity Map (CMAP)/L1000 platform to study SMA.

While individual V1 neurons have been shown to exhibit speed selectivity, functional architecture for speed preference has been primarily reported in higher cortical areas such as primate area MT. Using multi-channel electrophysiology in anesthetized female ferrets, we investigated the joint tuning of V1 neurons for spatial frequency, temporal frequency, orientation/direction, and speed.

We found that both simple and complex cells can exhibit speed tuning, and no strong variation across cortical layers. In reanalysis of intrinsic signal imaging data from cat V1, we observed repeating \"hot spots\" of high speed selectivity separated by \"cold spots\" with low tuning for speed.

Our study aims to elucidate the pathomechanism of insulin resistance in DM1 and how the pathway responds to AMPK stimulation. Proteomic analysis from sedentary wildtype and sedentary HSA-LR mice, a common DM1 mouse model, revealed downregulation of the AMPK-PGC-1 axis. Analysis of sedentary HSA-LR mice and exercised HSA-LR mice revealed activation of the AMPK-PGC-1 axis in exercised animals. To investigate this pathway, we treated WT and HSA-LR mice with the AMPK activator AICAR to examine the impact of AMPK stimulation on insulin signaling in DM1. This revealed impaired responses in the insulin pathway activation in the HSA-LR mice. Next, we examined whether these differences extended to a human model by treating control and DM1 myotubes with insulin and/or AICAR. In DM1 myotubes, both treatments produced dampened responses of key insulin signaling intermediates compared to controls.

By manipulating sucrose availability to the host plant, we could steer the sex determination of G. pallida. Whereas high-sucrose medium promotes female development, low-sucrose medium promotes male development. Transcriptome analyses on the early stages of parasitism reveal that female development requires extensive transcriptional activation and post-transcriptional regulation. We identify Gp-lin-29, a transcription factor homologous to lin-29 in Caenorhabditis elegans, as a potential regulator of ESD. Small RNA sequencing uncovered the male-biased expression of Gp-let-7, a putative repressor of Gp-lin-29, and the female-biased expression of four miRNAs, including Gp-miR-100, located at the same genomic locus as Gp-let-7. Target prediction and enrichment analyses suggest that these female-biased miRNAs actively suppress male developmental programs. Together, our findings support a model in which G. pallida juveniles follow a default male developmental trajectory unless redirected by favourable environmental cues to become female.

Here we optimized an innovative, ultra-sensitive RIAN-seq method capable of mapping genome-wide R-loop landscape using ultra-low cell numbers to investigate R-loop dynamics in mouse gametes and early embryos. Our findings reveal the widespread presence of AT-rich R-loops during early mouse embryonic development and highlight their critical roles in orchestrating transcription machinery during zygotic genome activation (ZGA). We demonstrate that the stability and inheritance of R-loops through developmental stages are governed by their sequence composition, with GC-rich R-loops exhibiting greater stability. Notably, R-loops, particularly AT-rich R-loops, inhibit DDX21 helicase activity on the 7SK/HEXIM1 snRNP complex, thereby reducing CDK9 release. This, in turn, modulates the phosphorylation of Ser2 at C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPIIS2p) at the promoters of major ZGA and maternal genes. Furthermore, R-loops promote RNAPII accumulation at major ZGA gene promoters, preventing RNAPII from premature release and ensuring timely activation of major ZGA genes. Conversely, R-loops enhance the retention of stalled RNAPII at maternal gene promoters, effectively repressing their expression and facilitating the maternal-to-zygotic transition. In summary, our study unveils a key role for R-loops in regulating the maternal-to-zygotic transcription transition and early embryonic development in mice.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Methods We simulated 36 TEER repairs in finite element models of three human tricuspid valves. We used either a NTW or XTW TriClip. The clip was placed between either the anterior-septal or anterior-posterior leaflet pairs, in either the central or near-annulus site. For each scenario, we quantified the reduction in annular area, septal-lateral (SL) diameter, and anterior-posterior (AP) diameter. We also report the total annular force, orientation of maximum annular force, total papillary muscle force, leaflet stress, and coaptation area ratio following TEER. Results TEER induced annular forces, which strongly predicted the annuloplasty effect as measured by reduction in annular area and SL diameter. The maximum annular force aligned with the orientation of the clip. Furthermore, XTW clips induced more annular force and leaflet stress than NTW clips. A central anterior-posterior site induced more force than a near-annulus anterior-posterior site, but showed no difference from an anterior-septal pair. Conclusions TEER procedural parameters, such as clip size and site, strongly influence the magnitude of induced annular forces, which, in turn, correlate with the degree of annuloplasty effect.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "In vitro colonies of the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei expand radially and establish fingering instabilities, a collective behavior known as social motility. The underlying mechanisms are thought to involve single-cell motility, chemical communication among cells, and mechanical interactions with the liquid boundary, but their relative contributions remain unclear. We aimed to determine which of the mechanisms are necessary to quantitatively reproduce the morphological characteristics of social motility. We developed a two-dimensional agent-based model that simulates colonies of approximately 105-106 cells at single-cell resolution--two to four orders of magnitude larger than previous models. Cells are represented as point particles executing directional random walks with auto-chemotactic alignment, combined with reflective and mutable boundaries and exponential colony growth. The model was quantitatively evaluated by applying our previously established morphology metrics. We show quantitative agreement of the simulation results and experimental data in terms of colony morphology. Parameter exploration revealed that finger formation arises within a narrow range of trypanosome motility parameters that balance stochasticity and alignment, while boundary conditions modulate the speed of colony expansion. The diffusion coefficient of the chemotactic signal is the key determinant of pattern formation. Realistic behavior occurs at 2 x10-11-10-10 m2/s, which corresponds to molecules of 12.1-1690 kDa. These results demonstrate that complex colony morphologies can emerge from minimal cell-level rules, suggesting testable hypotheses for the molecular drivers of trypanosome social motility. Furthermore, our approach provides a framework for dissecting the interplay between motility, signaling, and mechanical confinement in other microbial systems exhibiting collective behavior.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Chordomas can exhibit immunogenic features, and immune checkpoint blockade has demonstrated clinical activity in some patients, yet the determinants of these responses remain poorly understood. We aimed to elucidate the biological basis of immunogenicity in chordomas through spatial transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. We applied GeoMx digital spatial profiling to 15 chordomas, analyzing tumor and stromal compartments separately and comparing inflamed and non-inflamed tumors. Consecutive tissue sections were examined using MALDI-mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) at 20 m spatial resolution. Findings were further explored through immunohistochemistry analyses. To assess whether transcriptional activity in tumor cells was associated with interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) signaling, we tested the effect of IFN-{gamma} treatment on chordoma cell lines. Digital spatial profiling of inflamed and non-inflamed chordomas revealed striking differences in both the cancer cell and stromal compartments. Increased immune infiltration was strongly associated with elevated transcriptional activity in cancer cells. MALDI-MSI revealed distinct metabolic signatures and pronounced glycogen accumulation in inflamed chordomas. Nevertheless, IFN-{gamma} stimulation of chordoma cell lines did not induce expression of TBXT (brachyury), the master transcriptional regulator of chordoma biology. Collectively, our findings reveal a strong association between the transcriptomic and metabolic activity in chordomas and their immunogenicity. However, the causal direction of this relationship remains to be determined. Nevertheless, these findings are highly relevant for patient stratification, particularly in the context of immunotherapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Previous evidence suggested that circulating cationic or hyposialylated IgM may contribute to podocyte injury in idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (iNS). Methods: Serum IgM from pediatric and young adult patients with podocytopathies, membranous nephropathy (MN), lupus nephritis (LN), and healthy controls were analyzed by lectin-based ELISA using a panel of six biotinylated lectins to detect terminal N-glycan residues. Among these, Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) binds 2,6-linked sialic acid, and Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCA-I) recognizes {beta}1,4-linked galactose. Serum levels of the 2,6-sialyltransferase ST6GAL1 and the sialidases neuraminidase-1 (NEU1) and neuraminidase-3 (NEU3) were quantified. Cultured human podocytes were exposed to patient-derived, control, or enzymatically modified IgM (desialylated/resialylated) and analyzed by confocal microscopy, quantitative proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and metabolic assays. Results: IgM from patients with podocytopathies showed reduced SNA binding, which inversely correlated with proteinuria (r = -0.69, P < 0.0001) and with serum sialidases NEU1/NEU3 (r = -0.67/-0.59, P < 0.0001). In paired samples, SNA reactivity decreased during relapse and normalized in remission, indicating dynamic modulation with disease activity. ST6GAL1 was undetectable in all groups. In contrast, PLA2R1-positive MN, in which pathogenic antibodies target podocyte PLA2R1, displayed reduced RCA-I binding. Podocytes exposed to hyposialylated or desialylated IgM exhibited actin disorganization, loss of nephrin signal, increased lipid peroxidation, and decreased ATP synthesis. In contrast, resialylated IgM preserved morphology and metabolism comparable to controls. Proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling revealed enrichment of MAPK, mTOR, AMPK, and cytoskeletal remodeling pathways. Conclusions: IgM hyposialylation, driven by extracellular sialidases up-regulation, correlates with disease activity and promotes oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cytoskeletal remodeling in podocytes, identifying immune glycan remodeling as a modifiable determinant of podocyte injury and a potential biomarker of disease activity.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

As a syncytium embedded within a complex microenvironment, muscle relies on the coordination of distinct myonuclear populations and diverse mononucleated cell types. Here, we present a high-resolution single-nucleus RNA-sequencing atlas of 550000 skeletal muscle nuclei, capturing the longitudinal transcriptional responses of 17 distinct myonuclear and 21 mononuclear cell populations at multiple time points after one bout of exhaustive exercise in trained and sedentary mice. The transcriptional programs of these populations are further shaped by training status into divergent adaptive trajectories. A subset of oxidative myonuclei enters a delayed regenerative state post-exercise, reflecting a bifurcated response to a disproportionate metabolic load on fibers during endurance exercise. Prior training accelerates homeostatic recovery and shields oxidative nuclei from exacerbated damage signatures. In parallel, mononucleated cells emerge as the primary mediators of intercellular communication during recovery. Together, this dataset establishes that training adaptation emerges through a coordinated interplay of intrinsic adaptive programs of multicellular remodeling, and provides a foundational resource for mechanistic insights into muscle plasticity.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

The moss Physcomitrella (Physcomitrium patens) is a model organism for plant physiology, development, and evolution. However, little is known about TOR signalling in non-vascular plants, including Physcomitrella. Here, we report the effects of inhibiting TOR signalling in Physcomitrella. We identified and characterized Physcomitrella 12-kD FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), which binds TOR in the presence of rapamycin. Whereas the growth of wild-type protonema is unaffected by rapamycin, overexpressing endogenous FKBP12 rendered the plant susceptible to the inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner. Likewise, protonema growth was inhibited when the TOR-specific ATP-competitive inhibitor AZD8055 was present in the culture. We show that rapamycin and AZD8055 have pleiotropic effects, as they delay cell cycle progression and development, induce chlorosis, inhibit photosynthesis, and alter total protein content. Additionally, we identified and characterized PpTOR, PpLST8, and PpRAPTOR, key components of TOR complex 1 (TORC1), whereas RICTOR and mSIN1 of TORC2 are not encoded by the moss genome. We found that PpLst8 substitutes its homolog in yeast to allow cell growth. Physcomitrella mutants were generated with a conditional downregulation of PpTOR, PpLST8, and PpRAPTOR, respectively. They were impaired in growth. Finally, we show TOR-dependent phosphorylation of a well-known TOR phospho-target, the ribosomal protein RPS6, via LC-MS/MS. Collectively, our results show that Physcomitrella growth and development is positively controlled by a conserved TOR kinase. We suggest to further dissect TOR signalling in Physcomitrella in order to elucidate signalling integration via TORC1 in plants.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Histone deacetylase HDA19 is a key epigenetic regulator in Arabidopsis, and hda19 deficient mutants are tolerant to several abiotic stresses. Through acetylome profiling, we identified a non-canonical K27/K36 di-acetylation mark on histone H3.3 among nine H3 variants as a key substrate of HDA19. The epigenetic mark accumulation decreased and increased in wild-type plants and hda19 mutants, whereas other known H3 marks were equally affected in response to salinity stress in both genotypes. Mimicking constitutive diacetylation of this H3K27/K36 mark led to the accumulation of stress resistance-mediating late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins and induced salinity tolerance, similar to that observed in hda19 mutants. The loss of function mutants of lea7-1/lea29-1/rab18-1 abolished the salinity tolerance of hda19.

Twenty healthy individuals completed two fMRI sessions using parallel task versions. Participants learned picture pseudoword associations across four learning blocks. A lexical decision task served as control condition. Behavioral learning was analyzed using linear mixed models. Whole brain and region of interest analyses examined learning related activity changes and their behavioral relevance. TRR was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. Participants successfully acquired the novel-word forms, indexed by increased accuracy and faster latency across stages. Behavioral outcomes showed good to excellent TRR. The task elicited robust language learning related activity and activity changes across stages were correlated with learning success. The control task showed no consistent activity changes. Task-related brain activity showed substantial variability, but a subset of voxels (~30%) within significant clusters showed good consistency. In sum, we identified accessible, reliable and functionally relevant cortical targets for enhancing novel word learning by tDCS.

In a computational model, neurons with human-type synapses detected hidden patterns more quickly in noise, and this superiority was only evident in unsupervised learning. Tracking synaptic weights revealed that human synapses were potentiated sharply and persistently by the patterns, while macaque-type synapses were broadly potentiated, which were easily eroded.

Since a given scalp-level electrical pattern can result from multiple source configurations, ESI methods address this ill-posed inverse problem by imposing constraints on the structure of underlying sources. Here, we present an efficient approach that imposes sparsity on both the source-level activity and its spatial gradient. Unlike other methods that generally require a heuristic choice of a regularization parameter that balances between data fidelity and constraints, our method iteratively adjusts the parameter value based on the noise level in a fully automated way. The performance of the new method is evaluated across different scenarios of realistic synthetic HR-EEG data, including unifocal and synchronous multifocal cortical epileptic activity. Based on multiple performance indices, we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional methods in accurately reconstructing epileptic sources. We also show that the method reduces polarity artifacts responsible for ghost sources and spatial discontinuities. Its ability to recover homogeneous, well-delineated regions of activity is further confirmed using real EEG data capturing a typical absence seizure.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

It is also unclear how neural value signals guide choices when the context involves choosing the most favorable option or avoiding the most unfavorable one. To address these questions, we recorded intracerebral activity from 27 participants as they first rated pleasant and unpleasant scenarios and then made binary choices across all combinations of item domain (pleasant/unpleasant) and choice frame (choose best/worst). Ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) broadband gamma activity (BGA, 50 to150 Hz) tracked the value of pleasant items during rating and pre-choice, correlating positively with the most pleasant item irrespective of choice frame. Similarly, anterior insula (aIns) BGA tracked the value of unpleasant items during rating and pre-choice, correlating negatively with the most unpleasant item irrespective of choice frame. The difference in relative value correlations between the vmPFC and aIns was larger for choices involving a conflict between item domain and choice frame, consistent with slower response times and choices less aligned with value differences in these trials.

Clues to the developmental origins of these asymmetries may be gained through associations with situs inversus totalis (SIT), a rare condition in which visceral organs are reversed on the left-right axis. In the largest previous brain imaging analyses of SIT (38 cases, 38 controls from Belgium), typical functional asymmetries such as left-hemisphere language dominance were mostly unaltered, but various aspects of asymmetrical cerebral structure - petalia, bending, and posterior venous anatomy - were often reversed in this condition. SIT can be a monogenic trait that arises from rare genetic variants, usually affecting motile cilia which help to create the embryonic left-right body axis. However, most SIT cases do not have obvious genetic causes and may arise from environmental or random effects during embryogenesis. We sequenced the genomes of 23 SIT cases and 23 controls from the Belgian brain imaging dataset and pooled with prior data from 15 cases and 15 controls. We aimed to discover whether there are altered brain asymmetries in SIT cases with disruptive DNA variants in ciliary genes, or in other types of genes, as compared to genetically unsolved cases. In total, 19 cases had likely causal variants affecting ciliary function, while 19 cases remained genetically unsolved. Functional and structural brain asymmetries were not significantly different in genetically solved versus unsolved SIT cases. Therefore, functional brain asymmetries seem largely independent of known mechanisms of visceral situs formation, while structural brain torque is altered in SIT regardless of the presence or absence of overt genetic causes.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Here, we simulate food web evolution to track how the correspondence between phylogeny and trophic structure changes as communities assemble and niche space fills. By simulating trait evolution coupled with trait-matching for ecological interactions, we quantify how phylogenetic signal in trophic structure changes through time and examine how species' network positions relate to their phylogenetic distinctiveness and diversification dynamics. We find that the signal declines over time, driven by emergent feedbacks between node extinction, link reorganization, and trait divergence. Species with high phylogenetic distinctiveness tend to be more specialized and occupy peripheral network positions, particularly in late-stage communities. Centrality consistently constrains diversification in intermediate consumers, emerges as a limiting factor for top predators after niche saturation, and shows nonlinear effects in basal species' diversification. Applying our framework to empirical food webs from the Galapagos Islands, we find partial support for these predictions: phylogenetic signal in foraging and vulnerability roles declines with island age, but shows contrasting trends with island area and elevation. We also detect discrepancies between distance-based and clustering-based measures of phylogenetic signal, highlighting the need for robust methods to compare phylogenetic and network structures.

This method translates object movement - direction, speed, and acceleration - into colour gradients, enabling both human annotators and pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to infer motion patterns while retaining high-resolution spatial detail. Using a range of case studies, we demonstrate how the increased salience of motion information allows for the robust detection of objects that are challenging or impossible to identify reliably from static frames alone, particularly in complex natural scenes. We further demonstrate the reliable classification of different behaviours in animals and single-celled organisms. Additionally, the framework supports flexible hierarchical model structures that can separate the tasks of detection and classification for optimal efficiency, and provide individual tracking data that specifies what is present where and what it is doing in each frame. The framework makes use of the latest deep learning architecture (YOLO), combined with a semi-supervised annotation workflow. Together with salient motion information, these features can dramatically reduce the effort required for dataset annotation such that reliable models can often be made within an hour. Moreover, smaller annotation datasets mean that model training can be achieved on conventional computers without dedicated hardware, thereby improving accessibility.

E.; Watt, P. J.", "abstract": "Increasing drought frequency under climate change is expected to intensify periods of suboptimal soil moisture, adversely affecting earthworms and other soil biota. To survive desiccation, some earthworms enter aestivation, a state of reduced metabolic activity during which reproduction and ecosystem service provision are suspended. However, the capacity of earthworms to recover from repeated drying events remains poorly understood. This study examined how multiple drought-aestivation cycles influence the reproductive performance of Allolobophora chlorotica, one of the most common UK earthworm species. Adults were exposed to one, two or three 14-day drying periods to gravimetric moisture contents of ~11-13 wt% in loamy soil, each followed by three days under favourable moisture conditions. After the final exposure, earthworms were placed in groups of four into optimally moist soil for 50 days to reproduce. Cocoon number, mass, viability and incubation time were measured as indicators of reproductive success. Cocoon production declined significantly with increasing aestivation frequency (p < 0.001), being lowest during Days 1-10 of recovery (~0-0.02 cocoons earthworm-1 day-1), peaking between Days 20-30 (~0.08-0.16 cocoons earthworm-1 day-1) and declining over the final 20 days (~0.08-0.12 cocoons earthworm-1 day-1). Unexpectedly, earthworms previously exposed to drying and aestivation produced more (226 vs 171 cocoons, p < 0.05) and heavier (6.701 {+/-} 1.205 vs 6.036 {+/-} 1.256 mg, p < 0.05) cocoons than those kept under constant high moisture, suggesting compensatory growth upon rehydration and possibly reflecting food limitation or soil compaction in controls. Cocoon viability and incubation time did not differ significantly between treatments. Across treatments, earthworm mass strongly predicted fecundity as heavier individuals produced more (p < 0.001) and heavier (p <0.001) cocoons, and cocoon mass was positively correlated with hatching success (p < 0.001). Overall, Al. chlorotica displayed resilience to short-term, intermittent drought through aestivation, but reproductive success remained sensitive to the combined effects of soil moisture, food availability, and soil structure. These findings highlight the importance of considering multiple environmental constraints when predicting soil fauna responses to increasing drought frequency and duration.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Our analysis revealed a strong link between surface temperature during the embryonic phase and YOY recruitment success. Embryonic thermal conditions alone explained 44 to 88% of the variability in YOY density across lakes, confirming temperature as a key predictor of perch recruitment.

We introduce FlexRV, an approach that greatly improves the power to detect gene-based associations in rare variant aggregation tests by modelling nonlinear relationships between functional annotations and phenotype. Across 62 quantitative and 44 disease traits in the UK Biobank, we show that FlexRV outperforms previous approaches such as DeepRVAT, STAAR, and Regenie, discovering 51% more quantitative and 102% more disease trait associations than the widely used Regenie method.

We explore the genetic architecture of complex traits using FlexRV burden tests, finding nearly equal contributions from missense and loss of function variants to rare variant burden heritability.

The mbk-1 gene in Caenorhabditis elegans has been identified as an ortholog to mammalian Dyrk1a, and genetic knockout of mbk-1 in C. elegans is not lethal. We hypothesized that deletion of the mbk-1 gene would alter chemosensory function, learning, and motility in C. elegans, and uncover developmental roles that may inform function of mammalian Dyrk1a. Using behavioral preference index assays, analyses of locomotion, and learning in classical conditioning procedures, an mbk-1 knockout strain of C. elegans, EK228, was characterized to identify potential roles of mbk-1 in development. Preference index assays to assess chemosensory capabilities determined that mbk-1 deletion yielded no detrimental effects. Thrashing and foraging behavior analyses uncovered significant deficits in movement in the EK228 C. elegans, suggesting a role of mbk-1 in locomotion and motility. Lastly, classical conditioning revealed no significant deficits in the abilities of the EK228 strain in forming associative connections between stimuli. Overall, these results imply that EK228 may be a useful model for studying the developmental effects of mbk-1 and implicate the gene in fundamental functions in adaptive movement in the simplified nervous system of C. elegans. Further understanding of this model could provide insight into the early roles of Dyrk1a in mammalian development.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Even with high efficiency, though, overall drive performance can be reduced by somatic Cas9 expression and by maternal deposition of Cas9, leading to resistance allele formation. The nanos promoter for Cas9 shows very little leaky somatic expression, but it causes high rates of embryo resistance allele formation in Drosophila melanogaster. By truncating the promoter, we reduced rates of embryo resistance to undetectable levels, but germline cutting in females decreased by over half. Germline cutting and successful drive conversion was eventually lost when only the 5' UTR was present, though males still retained moderate germline drive efficiency. Several additional methods were tested to improve performance, including additional suppressor elements to the 3' UTR and introns to increase expression level. The most successful of these was the addition of a second nuclear localization signal, which substantially increased activity when coupled with a full-length or truncated nanos promoter. Overall, these experiments show the potential to modulate Cas9 regulatory elements to achieve desired expression for gene drive applications, while also showcasing the difficulty of obtaining an optimal activity profile.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

However, most current predictive models offer limited mechanistic resolution at the fragmental level. We present a novel physical-chemical computational framework, which is based on systematically perturbing a parent molecule, to quantify fragment-level contributions to both a specific mechanistic action and a broader functional outcome. To test our theoretical approach, we investigated local structural contributions to pyronaridine (PY), a clinically used antimalarial drug with a mechanistically distinctive mode of inhibition of hematin crystal growth via step-bunching. Chemically plausible PY molecular analogs have been computationally generated by selectively removing or substituting functional groups hypothesized to influence either step-bunching mechanisms or whole-parasite blood-stage activity. For each analog, we predicted the probability of four different crystal-growth inhibition mechanisms using a centroid-based similarity model based on a small dataset of experimentally verified crystal-growth inhibitors. The blood-stage antimalarial activity has also been estimated using the MAIP platform. A systematic comparison of molecular analogs revealed that step-bunching mechanisms depend primarily on two protonated pyrrolidines, with chlorobenzene as a strong secondary contributor. In contrast, antimalarial activity is more distributed, relying on coordinated interactions between aromatic-heteroatom scaffolds and an amine linker. The obtained results demonstrate that our approach can disentangle position-specific and cooperative fragmental effects, offering mechanistically interpretable guidance for the design of mechanism-optimized inhibitors. The framework might be broadly applicable across chemical and materials domains where linking local structure to specific mechanisms is essential.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

This work investigated the response of osteoblast-like Saos-2 cells to model gold substrates presenting pre-adsorbed fetuin-A as a surface modification, to determine the role of the protein in cell attachment and proliferation. Correlative quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), surface plasmon resonance, and radiolabeling confirmed fetuin-A adsorbed on model surfaces in similar quantities compared to serum albumin but formed a less packed layer with increased water entrapment. Surfaces presenting pre-adsorbed fetuin-A enhanced cellular adhesion, similar to fibronectin, but attached cells displayed morphological characteristics more similar to those with pre-adsorbed albumin, with lower average surface area and maximum axis. Over 3 days, fetuin-A exhibited lower cellular proliferation compared to the fibronectin control, likely correlated to the decrease in cellular metabolism observed at the same time-point, and persisted over 7 days. These results provide insight into the role of adsorbed fetuin-A for bone-interfacing implant applications, suggesting the pre-adsorption of the protein alone aids cellular attachment, but is not sufficient to promote early stages of osseointegration.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Using custom culture devices with curved geometries for two-dimensional (2D) culture, continuous confluent cell-ECM layers were formed that were then delaminated and guided by strategically positioned central cores with different shapes and sizes to undergo tension-mediated remodeling into mechanically stable hollow structures. This approach allows modulation of wall thickness, supports multi-layered architectures, and yields constructs capable of withstanding fluid flow.

Event-related potential (ERP) studies have identified two key neural signatures of recognition memory: the parietal old/new effect and the frontal old/new effect. Despite extensive research on these ERP components, the extent to which these components reflect distinct memory processes remains debated. In the present study, we investigated how repetitive learning modulates these ERP components. Participants repeatedly studied a fixed list of 32 real-world images across up to five study-test repetitions while EEG was recorded. Additionally, a separate set size 1 condition served as a proxy for working memory. Our results showed that with increased repetitions, the parietal old/new effect exhibited enhanced amplitude and earlier peak latency, reflecting more efficient retrieval of well-learned memories. In contrast, the frontal old/new effect remained unchanged in both amplitude and timing. These findings suggest that the parietal old/new effect is a sensitive neural marker of learning-related changes in long-term memory representations, while the frontal effect is less influenced by repetition. Additionally, despite similarly high accuracy between the well-practiced set size 32 condition and the set size 1 working memory condition, both parietal and frontal old/new effects peaked significantly earlier for set size 1, suggesting that access to working memory is substantially faster than even well-practiced long-term memory.

Building on our recent work, we investigated how EEG activity and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) are related to one another, and how they jointly underpin rs-fMRI metrics. Using a multimodal dataset with macrovascular correction applied to all rs-fMRI metrics, we first examined associations between EEG metrics and CMRO2, then applied mediation analysis to evaluate how CMRO2 mediates EEG-fMRI associations. We found that bandlimited EEG theta and alphafractional power was significantly associated with CMRO2. Bandlimited EEG coherence was also associated with CMRO2 across all the bands. Bandlimited EEG fractional power and coherence were also significantly associated with cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in a manner that varied by frequency. EEG broadband temporal complexity was positively associated with CMRO2; and EEG coherence was negatively associated with OEF. Notably, there are pronounced sex differences in these relationships, which suggests that the biophysical underpinnings of rs-fMRI are sex dependent. Moreover, the baseline metabolic and hemodynamic variables did partially mediate EEG-fMRI associations, with CMRO2 serving as the primary mediator. However, most of the mediations are partial, highlighting the complex interplay among electrophysiological activity, oxidative metabolism, and hemodynamics.

However, it is still unclear which brain region structures face information in the face pathway. To further elucidate this mechanism, we investigated fusiform face area (FFA) during passive face image presentation using a whole-brain vascular space occupancy (VASO) 7T layer fMRI open dataset combined with multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA). We analysed lateral occipital cortex (LOC) as a control region and BOLD data in the dataset as a control contrast. We trained multiple binary classification decoders with various image categories (e.g., face vs. others, house vs. others) and three cortical layer groups independently to assess information representation across cortical depths. Our results revealed that decoding accuracies in VASO data peaked in the middle layer of FFA, suggesting feedforward signature specifically during face processing. This effect was not observed in LOC or in decoders for other image categories. These findings indicate that face information is structured prior to processing in the FFA, consistent with previous reports suggesting that face-related features are partially extracted before reaching higher-level face areas.

Importantly, no WM alterations were found in areas surrounding the olfactory (piriform) cortex. In contrast to congenital sensory loss in other systems, we show that morphological alterations due to lifelong olfactory deprivation are limited. Alterations are primarily localized around the olfactory sulcus and likely due to the absence of olfactory bulbs. A possible explanation for the lack of major morphological alterations in individuals with congenital anosmia is that the olfactory regions may be recruited for non-olfactory functions.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

In free-living single-celled ciliates such as Stentor coeruleus, rapid wound healing is necessary to repair breaches to the plasma membrane, where any delays represent the difference between life and death. In order to discover novel molecular pathways that are important for healing in Stentor, we carried out a targeted RNA interference-based perturbation genetic screen combined with microsurgical wounding using a microfluidic guillotine to introduce reproducible bisection wounds. We identified a Stentor syntaxin gene that was necessary for cell survival, particularly post-wounding, with only ~37% of the syntaxin-deficient cells surviving compared with ~98% of the control cells. Syntaxin-deficient cells were more susceptible to hyposmotic shock and became increasingly vacuolated in the hours post-wounding, eventually leading to cell death. Osmotic stabilization of the cells during and after bisection partially restored the post-wound survival in knockdown cells. These results support the interpretation that syntaxin-deficient cells lack essential membrane fusion machinery, which manifests in vacuolar defects, and are deficient in maintaining osmotic homeostasis necessary for their survival post-wounding.

One member, galectin-8 preferentially binds galactose that contains a terminal sulfate. Aberrant expression and secretion of sulfated glycosylation epitopes such as 3'-Sulfo-LeA/C is a feature of high-risk human foregut metaplasias. In addition, recent work has demonstrated that 3'-Sulfo-LeC is a marker of mature murine zymogenic chief cells of the stomach, and that 3'-Sulfo-LeC epitope is secreted via cathartocytosis during cell transition to a metaplastic state. Based on those findings, we used Lgals8-/- mice to determine whether galectin-8 might play a role in chief cell homeostasis. We observed delayed gastric differentiation in the Lgals8-/- mice, but discovered that this phenotype was due to an unappreciated deletion of Mmrn1 and Snca in the Lgals8-/- line. We show that multimerin-1 tempers WNT stimulation of the gastric corpus at early age as evidenced by Beta-Catenin staining and proliferation throughout the gland. Because multimerin-1 is synthesized and secreted from endothelial cells and not from the epithelial compartment, these data uncover a role for mesodermal cells in epithelial developmental and maturation of the mouse stomach.

However, most studies integrating these organismal properties into species competition have emphasized only the increasing phase of the thermal response. Understanding how performance declines beyond thermal optima is equally critical if we are to anticipate the impacts of global warming on community composition. Here, we provide a modeling framework to explore the conditions under which temperatures exceeding thermal optima hinder species coexistence. We contrast our theoretical predictions with publicly available experimental data on Drosophila. Our results show that warmer conditions reduce coexistence when species' preferred temperature ranges scale positively with body size and their maximum metabolic rates occur at optimal temperatures. When species share similar body size and thermal optima, coexistence probability peaks at the optimum but declines more sharply under warming than under cooling. Conversely, when species differ in thermal optima but have similar body size, coexistence probability is highest at temperatures closer to the lower optimum. Together, our work establishes a formal approach to understanding species losses and community reassembly under global warming.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Although ancient genomes have been sequenced from southern Patagonia, genomic data from the central Southern Cone remain temporally and spatially sparse. The archaeological record of this region documents major cultural transformations during the Middle and Late Holocene, yet their relationship to demographic processes has long been debated. Here, we present genome-wide data from 52 individuals spanning the past 5,000 years, originating from four regions of the central Southern Cone in present-day Argentina and Uruguay: the central and southern Pampas, Northwest Patagonia, the Parana River Delta and Lower Uruguay River, and the eastern lowlands of Uruguay. Genomic evidence from the Pampas reveals the presence of at least three distinct ancestries during the Middle Holocene. While genetic contacts with southern Patagonian groups were sporadic, we identify the expansion of an ancestry of unknown geographic origin by 4,800 years ago, which increased substantially during the Late Holocene. This same ancestry arrived in Northwest Patagonia by at least 600 years ago, and it co-existed with individuals carrying a southern Andean genetic profile until colonial times. Genetic structure differentiates populations along the Parana River Delta, and the Lower Uruguay River by approximately 1,600 years ago. In contrast, individuals from the eastern lowlands of Uruguay show genetic links with Sambaqui-associated populations from the southern coast of Brazil, suggesting the role of human dispersals in connecting tropical lowland cultural traditions. Overall, our work documents the diffusion of genetically distinct groups across all regions studied and provides compelling evidence that large-scale human movements contributed to the remarkable cultural diversity of central Southern Cone populations during the Middle and Late Holocene.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

While prior research has focused mainly on protein aggregation and neuroinflammation, emerging evidence suggests that ionic imbalances, particularly involving sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+), may contribute to AD progression. Na+ and K+ are critical for maintaining neuronal membrane potential, regulating action potential firing, and supporting neurotransmitter function. Although studies primarily focused on absolute Na+ concentrations, the Na+/K+ ratio may provide a more sensitive marker of ionic dysregulation. Given that the Na+/K+ gradient is actively maintained by the Na/K-ATPase pump, a target known to be vulnerable in AD, we hypothesized that the Na+/K+ ratio is altered in AD. We analyzed postmortem tissue from the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 97 human subjects (67 AD, 30 controls). AD cases exhibited a significant increase in the Na+/K+ ratio in the thalamus and CSF, driven primarily by elevated Na+ levels. The Na+/K+ ratio positively correlated with Braak tangle stage, suggesting an association with AD progression. These findings provide novel insights into ionic dysregulation in AD and suggest that the CSF Na+/K+ ratio may serve as a valuable biomarker of disease severity and progression. Future research should explore the potential of targeting ionic homeostasis as a therapeutic strategy in AD.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) strategies using 3D bioprinting have emerged as promising alternatives, but still limited by the inability of directing stem cell differentiation in a controlled and reproducible manner. Advancing beyond this, we are proposing 3D bone printing via primed differentiation of stem cells with ultrasound (referred to here as ''3DBonUS''). This approach synergistically integrates low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) with a microfluidic-assisted 3D bioprinting platform enabling the biophysical stimulation of human bone marrow stromal cells (HBMSCs) during extrusion, promoting osteogenic differentiation without the need for post-fabrication treatments. Moreover, the incorporation of microbubbles enhanced the effects of LIPUS by amplifying mechanical signals at the cellular level. 3DBonUS was found to significantly upregulate key osteogenic markers (RUNX-2, ALP, COL1A1, BMP-2, OCN, OPN) as confirmed by immunofluorescence and RT-qPCR analysis. Furthermore, the LIPUS-treated constructs showed a significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition, indicating enhanced mineralisation. The 3DBonUS strategy represents a new modality in skeletal biofabrication, harnessing targeted minimally-invasive mechanical stimulation, with potential for manufacturing scalability and clinical application.

D.; Pham, P.; Hy, T.-S.", "abstract": "Complex diseases, such as cancer and neurodegeneration, feature interconnected pathways, making single-target therapies ineffective due to pathway redundancy and compensatory mechanisms. Polypharmacy, which combines multiple drugs to target distinct proteins, addresses this but often leads to drug-drug interactions, cumulative toxicity, and complex pharmacokinetics. To overcome these challenges, we introduce EVOSYNTH, a modular framework for multi-target drug discovery that combines latent evolution and synthesis-aware prioritization to generate and prioritize candidates with high translational potential. Latent evolution navigates a chemically and functionally informed latent space to identify candidates with strong predicted affinity across multiple targets. Synthesis-aware prioritization evaluates both retrosynthetic feasibility and the trade-off between synthetic cost and therapeutic reward, enabling practical and efficient candidate selection. Applied to dual inhibition of JNK3 and GSK3-beta in Alzheimer's disease and PI3K and PARP1 in ovarian cancer, EVOSYNTH consistently outperforms baseline generative models, achieving higher predicted affinities, improved scaffold diversity, and lower synthesis costs. These findings highlight EVOSYNTH's ability to integrate target-driven generation with practical synthesizability, establishing a scalable framework for multi-target and polypharmacological drug discovery.

G.; Gibbs, M.; Shioda, T.; Blumberg, B.", "abstract": "Obesity has become a global health challenge, and increasing evidence suggests that environmental obesogens contribute to its prevalence. Tributyltin (TBT) is a model obesogen known to activate PPAR{gamma} and RXR and to promote transgenerational obesity in mice, but the mechanisms linking TBT exposure to impaired energy balance remain poorly defined. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a central regulator of energy expenditure (EE) and basal metabolic rate (BMR) through both UCP1-dependent and UCP1-independent pathways. Here, we tested whether ancestral TBT exposure disrupts BAT function across generations. To assess whether TBT alters body composition and thermogenic capacity, we measured fat and lean mass, BAT gene expression, mitochondrial abundance, and core body temperature in F1 and F3 offspring. TBT-group males accumulated more fat mass without changes in lean mass or food intake scaled to metabolic size, indicating reduced EE/BMR. Expression of BAT lineage and oxidative genes (Zic1, Ebf2, Pgc1a, Pdk4) was suppressed in TBT-group males across generations. Ucp1 expression was unchanged at baseline but decreased after high-fat diet (HFD) challenge, whereas Ucp2 and Ucp4 were reduced even at baseline. In addition, key UCP1-independent thermogenic genes involved in creatine (Slc6a8, Ckb) and calcium (Atp2a2, Itpr) futile cycles were significantly decreased, while lipid-cycle genes (Pnpla2, Abhd5) were unaffected. Mitochondrial DNA content was largely unchanged, but core body temperature was reduced in TBT-group males prior to diet challenge, confirming impaired basal thermogenesis. These findings demonstrate that ancestral TBT exposure produces male-specific and heritable defects in BAT identity and thermogenic capacity. By suppressing both UCP1-dependent and UCP1-independent pathways without altering mitochondrial abundance, TBT-group males exhibit reduced energy expenditure and basal metabolic rate.

Deep learning offers promising solutions, particularly for bacterial profiling using omics data. For instance, classifying bacterial strains as resistant or susceptible to antibiotics depends on identifying genomic signatures associated with resistance mechanisms. This study introduces DeepMDC, a deep learning architecture for bacterial profiling that utilizes whole-genome data as input. In genomics, obtaining precise labels for each gene or mutation is costly and often ambiguous; therefore, labels are typically aggregated. Consequently, phenotypic classification is framed as a Multiple-instance learning problem, where training data comprise sets (bags) of instances with a single label per bag. The core component of DeepMDC is a Modern Hopfield Network, and its input encompasses all open reading frames (ORFs) identifiable in a genome, including small ORFs. A key feature of DeepMDC is its interpretability, which facilitates model validation and hypothesis generation regarding bacterial resistance by leveraging the attention mechanism inherent to Modern Hopfield Networks. Evaluation is centered on Klebsiella pneumoniae and meropenem due to their clinical significance. DeepMDC achieves values exceeding 0.9 for several performance metrics, including ROC AUC, balanced accuracy, and F1 score. Several well-known resistance-associated genes, such as the Tn3-like element Tn4401 family transposase, received high attention scores during the inference process. The attention mechanism also suggests a potential role for small ORFs in meropenem resistance.

Here, we tested two approaches for applying inducible Calling Cards (iCC) in the murine brain. We engineered knock-ins of inducible versions of two TFs: Jun, an immediate early gene that serves as a proxy for neural activity, and Sp1, a promiscuous binder of CpG unmethylated regions that indicates active promoters. We fused hyperPiggyBac transposase and a tamoxifen-inducible domain (ERT2) to these TFs and tested the system for efficacy and temporal control of insertions, both in vitro and in vivo. Jun-iCC mice developed normally with no behavioral abnormalities, showed tamoxifen-dependent recording, and captured neural activity during pharmacologically induced seizures. Jun-iCC yields relatively low numbers of insertions, likely due to the transient expression of Jun. In contrast, Sp1-iCC provided substantially higher insertion numbers, but transgenic animals exhibited developmental abnormalities, including reduced viability, anophthalmia, and reduced body weight, suggesting that ERT2 domains may sequester Sp1 and thus significantly impact development. Nonetheless, these inducible Calling Cards mouse lines enable drug-inducible integration of transposon cargo into specific loci in the living mouse.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

One of the major challenges in studying bacterial pathogenesis in larvae is the limited availability of healthy larvae throughout the year. This seasonal constraint delays testing and impedes progress in understanding bacterial infections, disease management, and the development of effective treatments for bivalve aquaculture. To address this challenge, a hemocyte viability assay based on the resazurin assay was developed as an alternative for testing bacterial pathogenesis. The assay was optimized using eastern oyster hemocytes, and the lethal concentration (LC)50 values of a well-known bacterial pathogen of larvae (Vibrio coralliilyticus RE22) (107 {+/-} 22 multiplicity of infection (MOI)), a probiont (Phaeobacter inhibens S4) (2157 {+/-} 167 MOI), and several bacterial isolates from shellfish hatcheries were determined. The most virulent isolates had an LC50 ranging from 53 to 195 MOI, indicating high pathogenicity. To validate the assay, the isolates were tested on oyster larvae, confirming that bacterial isolates with low LC50 (<200 MOI) caused significant larval mortality, while other isolates exhibiting LC50 values ranging from 690 to 25389 MOI showed no adverse effect on the oyster larvae.

Ectopic expression of wild-type, but not the SUMO-defective K196R mutant, GNL3 completely abolished DNA damage response induced by knockdown of endogenous GNL3. GNL3 interacts with the BLM-DNA2 helicase-nuclease complex and is critical for DNA end resection and subsequent loading of RPA and RAD51. This interaction requires SUMOylation and SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) in both proteins.

Here, we profiled the exometabolomes of six axenic phytoplankton species representing key functional groups including a diatom (Thalassiosira pseudonana CCMP1335), a picoeukaryote (Micromonas commoda RCC299), a coccolithophore (Gephyrocapsa huxleyi CCMP371), a diazotrophic cyanobacterium (Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501), and two picocyanobacteria (Prochlorococcus marinus MIT 9301 and Synechococcus WH8102).

We estimated that these phytoplankton-derived exometabolites could supply up to 5% of the daily carbon quota of the dominant heterotrophic bacterium SAR11 in the surface ocean. Substantial variations in exometabolite identity and concentration across phytoplankton taxa underscore taxonomic diversity as a key driver in the supply and composition of labile DOC.

In this study, we reveal that auxin rapidly induces macroautophagy, a catabolic process critical for the removal and recycling of superfluous macromolecules. We demonstrate that natural auxin (IAA) triggers autophagy at physiological concentrations. Genetic and pharmacological analyses show that TIR1/AFB receptors and their adenylate cyclase activity are indispensable for autophagy induction. Furthermore, auxin-induced autophagy depends on transcription, highlighting its integration with the broader gene regulatory networks. Functionally, we show that auxin-induced autophagy is required for efficient developmental reprogramming and organogenesis in both root and shoots. Autophagy is induced at places of local auxin maxima and autophagy-deficient mutants exhibit delayed differentiation and retarded organ primordia progression at the meristematic zones. Together, our findings uncover a dual role for auxin in coordinating gene expression and autophagic clearance, thereby facilitating rapid and effective developmental transitions.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

We developed RainBar (Rainbow Barcodes), an optical barcoding system that supports pooled live-cell imaging with single-cell resolution. RainBar uses lentiviral co-delivery of spectrally distinct nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescent proteins to encode up to 64 unique perturbations per well. To mitigate barcode recombination and improve decoding accuracy, we employed single-template viral production, codon diversification, and a ratio-based spectral unmixing pipeline tailored to overlapping fluorophores. An inverted cytoplasmic segmentation approach and multilayer perceptron classifier enabled accurate barcode identification in both arrayed and pooled formats. As a proof of concept, we applied RainBar to dissect NF-{kappa}B signaling dynamics in epithelial cells. Live imaging of RelA translocation uncovered stimulus-specific kinetics: IL-1{beta} triggered rapid recovery, while TNF induced prolonged nuclear localization. In pooled CRISPRi screens, RainBar recovered known NF-{kappa}B regulators (e.g., IL1R1, MYD88, TNFRSF1A) and highlighted additional modulators, including the Ino80 chromatin remodeling complex subunits and KAT2A acetyltransferase. Together, these results position RainBar as a flexible platform for multiplexed, image-based functional genomics, with potential to reveal dynamic signaling architectures across diverse cellular contexts in live cells.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Both of these functions are known to mediate pro-tumorigenic effects of CTSB in a range of cancers. Here, we specifically investigate the role of CTSB in TNBC, an aggressive subtype of breast cancer, where we find that high expression of CTSB in TNBC is associated with better outcomes. We used CRISPR to knockout CTSB in two highly metastatic TNBC cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468, and find different effects. In MDA-MB-231 cells, knockout of CTSB has no effect on cell viability, increases tumor cell 3D invasion in an ECM-independent manner, and increases sensitivity to many standard of care chemotherapy drugs. However, in MDA-MB-468 cells, knockout of CTSB increases cell viability, decreases tumor cell 3D invasion, in an ECM-independent manner, and drives resistance to certain chemotherapy drugs without affecting response to others. We find that in these cells, CTSB is not secreted, and that differential downstream mTOR and Akt activation can explain the differences seen in these phenotypes. Overall, our studies demonstrate that CTSB can regulate TNBC cell phenotypes via its lysosomal cell-intrinsic role, but that effects are cell-line specific, suggesting potential heterogeneity in the role of CTSB in TNBC.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "The metabolic networks of most life forms integrate cost-benefit analysis to properly budget carbon and other essential nutrients through continuous assessment of nutrient availability and environmental threats. Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive model bacterium found in diverse ecological niches such as soil, marine environments, and the human gut. As such, B. subtilis cells finetune metabolic pathways by monitoring signals indicating the presence of nutrients and stressors. A highly conserved protein, GlmR, is a key player in rationing carbon for the production of cell envelope precursors. This function of GlmR can be attributed to its role in cell shape regulation and antibiotic resistance. Given its central position in carbon utilization, GlmR is under post-translational regulation by phosphorylation and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) binding. GlmR is also linked to cyclic-di-AMP (c-di-AMP), a nucleotide second messenger involved in stress response. In this study, we probed the importance of GlmR in cell morphogenesis, c-di-AMP signaling, and investigated the physiological significance of post-translational regulation. Our results reveal that cells lacking glmR exhibit: (i) increased susceptibility to tunicamycin, a cell envelope targeting antibiotic; (ii) impaired division site positioning; and (iii) elevated intracellular c-di-AMP concentration. Furthermore, we show that the function of GlmR is finetuned by UDP-GlcNAc binding, phosphorylation, and acetylation. Additionally, we provide evidence showing that the recently discovered enzymatic activity of GlmR is integral for its function. We show that GlmR is a cell width determinant and propose a model suggesting close cooperation with an actin-like protein, MreB. Overall, our studies highlight that GlmR is at the crux of carbon flux with an important role in maintaining cell envelope integrity.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Pacs1 also forms a complex with WD-repeat protein 37 (Wdr37), which is essential for lymphocyte homeostasis. Despite numerous proposed binding partners, a validated structure for Pacs1-containing protein complexes is lacking. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Pacs1-Wdr37 complex. Pacs1 binds Wdr37 through a conserved interface within its furin-binding region (FBR), the domain previously linked to cargo recognition. This interaction stabilizes Wdr37 and is critical for the expression of both proteins. A gain-of-function mutation in PACS1 (R203W) causes a highly penetrant neurodevelopmental syndrome. This pathogenic mutation lies on a solvent-exposed surface of the FBR and does not disrupt complex formation. Instead, Pacs1-R203W remains dependent on Wdr37 for stability and its levels can be reduced through targeted Wdr37 proteolytic degradation. Structural homology of the FBR to synaptotagmin C2 domains reveals a previously unrecognized ability of Pacs1 to bind negatively charged phospholipids through a unique positively charged cleft. Together these findings define the structural basis for Pacs1-Wdr37 complex assembly and stability, present potential strategies for Pacs1-mediated neurodevelopmental disease, and suggest novel Pacs1 functions in membrane association.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Unlike terrestrial lignocellulosic substrates, macroalgae polysaccharides contain multiple monomer types, branching patterns, and sulfation states. Additionally, macroalgae polyphenols have been shown to inhibit both microbial growth and their catalytic enzymes. While herbivorous fishes have evolved specialized gut microbiota to process these substrates, the enzymatic pathways remain poorly characterized, with few experimentally validated polysaccharide utilization loci or biochemically defined marine sulfatases, and limited understanding of polyphenol degradation. Here, we developed in vitro microcosms, based on the gut microbiome of the generalist macro-algivorous fish Kyphosus cinerascens to temporally resolve the activity of the microbial guilds involved in macroalgal polysaccharide and polyphenol transformation. First, parallel cDNA/DNA amplicon sequencing were employed to distinguish the natural active fraction from transient gut microbiome taxa. Four media combinations were able to propagate between 96% to 99% of the active hindgut microbial families, reproducing the cooperative degradation dynamics observed in vivo. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic profiling of these four optimized in vitro microcosms served as models to assess the stepwise functional successions occurring in the natural gut microbiome. Early Gammaproteobacteria expressed enzymes linked to polyphenol detoxification and alginate degradation, followed by Bacillota, Bacteroidota, and Verrucomicrobiota guilds targeting more recalcitrant sulfated polysaccharides and polyphenols.

In this study, we describe a bacterial defense system that directly senses phage-mediated host genome degradation. This system, called Metis, aborts phage infection once it detects the accumulation of the modified mono-nucleotide N-methyl-deoxyadenosine monophosphate (mdAMP). As methylation of deoxy adenosines occurs only in the context of the DNA polymer, intracellular accumulation of mdAMP serves as a definitive signal that the host genome has been degraded to its individual constituents. In type I Metis, sensing of mdAMP activates an NAD diphosphatase, leading to rapid NAD depletion and cessation of the infection process; while the effector in type II Metis is a transmembrane-spanning protein whose toxicity is triggered in response to the modified mono-nucleotide. We further show that Metis defense depends on endogenous DNA methylases, and that phages can escape Metis via mutations that inactivate phage-mediated host genome degradation.

To tackle this challenge, we focused on one new antimicrobial, the synthetic antimicrobial peptide SET-M33, and examined its ability to target porcine respiratory pathogens and a collection of porcine commensal nasal microbiota members in vitro. Our experiments revealed three key results. First, there were large differences in SET-M33 sensitivity across the tested strains. In particular, pathogenic Glaesserella parasuis was highly sensitive to SET-M33 at concentrations that did not affect the growth of most commensal strains. Second, some of the tested commensal strains (i.e. Rothia nasimurium and Staphylococcus aureus) were able to inactivate SET-M33 during in vitro cultivation. Third, despite this potential for SET-M33 inactivation by commensal strains, SET-M33 was still able to selectively eliminate pathogenic G. parasuis from in vitro co-cultures that also contained R. nasimurium.

NO's rapid production and consumption, coupled with its intrinsic reactivity, drive its biological importance; thus, defining mechanisms and targets of NO reactivity is necessary to assess its fate and impact. Cellular small molecules are a major class of NO-reactive targets, possessing a variety of molecular functionalities that can react with NO. Yet the capacity for secreted small molecules to react with NO, as well as the biological consequences of such reactivity, have received little attention. Here, we explore the reactivity of NO with phenazine metabolites, microbially-derived secreted small molecules that possess antibiotic properties and can modulate their microenvironment. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa as a model phenazine producer, we find that NO reacts with specific phenazines to yield stable, chemically-distinct products. These chemical transformations significantly attenuate phenazine antibiotic properties, including against the phenazine nonproducer Staphylococcus aureus, a competitor with P. aeruginosa for niches in the context of infection. By contrast, P. aeruginosa experiences rapid loss in viability when phenazines and NO react. This toxicity occurs even in the presence of S. aureus, which displays resistance to nitrosylated phenazines, implicating a specific toxicity dependent on the formation of the phenazine-NO adduct. These findings highlight the capacity of NO to transform metabolite activity and suggest that NO can tune microbial interactions in complex environments by a mechanism of action hitherto unappreciated.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

These models have enabled the prediction of the functional domains of killer toxins and postranslational modifications, including sites of proteolytic cleavage and disulfide bonds. They have also revealed unexpected homology between Saccharomyces killer toxins, suggesting that all but K28 are likely ionophores. Structural homology with the well-studied killer toxins K1 and K2 enabled prior empirical data to predict the antifungal and immunity mechanisms of the K1L, K21, K45, K74, and KHS toxins.

To investigate PaRXLR40 function, we used comparative approaches in N. benthamiana and Agathis australis (kauri), including RNA interference (RNAi), transient expression assays, confocal microscopy, yeast two-hybrid screens, and infection assays. We also examined host protein interactors and tested mutant variants to evaluate functional domains. Silencing PaRXLR40 reduced P. agathidicida colonization in N. benthamiana and A. australis. PaRXLR40 interacted with a host BTB/ARM domain protein (ARIA), previously implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) signalling. ARIA suppressed immunity and promoted infection, while interacting with NbSOG1, a DNA damage-associated transcription factor that enhanced resistance when overexpressed. External application of ABA enhanced P. agathidicida infection in both hosts, supporting the hypothesis that PaRXLR40 may hijack host ABA signalling through ARIA to promote susceptibility.

Pfcrt CVIET + A220S + Q271E + N326S + R371I and Pfcrt CVIET + A220S + Q271E + I356T + R371I mutants were significantly more resistant to monodesethyl-amodiaquine (md-AQ) compared to Pfcrt wild-type (WT) and Pfcrt CVIET + A220S + Q271E + R371I mutants. Pfdhfr triple mutants were significantly more pyrimethamine (PYR) resistant than Pfdhfr WT and revealed a range of phenotypes, but this was not explained by Pfgch1 copy-number. Pfdhps A437G parasites were significantly more sulfadoxine (SDX) resistant compared to Pfdhps wild-type and Pfdhps S436A mutants, suggesting that A437G is a key mutation for SDX resistance. Competitive growth assays between Pfdhfr-Pfdhps mutants revealed that Pfdhps mutations do not always result in fitness costs. Ongoing phenotypic assessment and genetic validation of these mutations in a Senegalese background is necessary to assess the impact of drug pressure, identify evolving genetic determinants of drug resistance, and provide molecular markers for ongoing surveillance to monitor and guide the use of drug-based interventions.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) primarily affects the cerebellum, though Ataxin-1 (ATXN1) is widely expressed. We previously showed that intensified interaction between mutant ATXN1 and Capicua (CIC) drives SCA1 pathogenesis in the cerebellum, whereas ATXN1 loss augments amyloid beta production in the hippocampus and cortex. CIC, however, forms a complex with ATXN1 and its paralog, Ataxin-1-like (ATXN1L)-yet knockout of either yields completely different phenotypes. To determine whether this could be due to CIC having two isoforms, we generated mice bearing either the long (CIC-L) or short (CIC-S) isoform. Loss of CIC-L led to cognitive deficits, whereas loss of CIC-S caused perinatal lethality, phenocopying, ATXN1 and ATXN1L knockout mice, respectively. Furthermore, CIC-L preferentially interacts with ATXN1, and CIC-S with ATXN1L.

Codon usage plays a significant role in maintaining stability and functions of genes. Perturbation in codon sequence can lead to functional and structural dysfunction of a gene. In our study, we performed the codon usage analyses of cell cycle-dependent genes. Various codon usage parameters were analyzed using nucleotide compositions like RSCU, ENC, and GC analyses. Codon usage analysis using nucleotide composition analysis showed that cell cycle dependent genes follow non-optimal codon usage. Genes preferred AT rich ending over GC rich ending, thereby suggesting preference for non-optimal codons. Neutrality and parity plot showed that the codon preference is a result of mutation selection pressure. To study the codon usage implications, we optimized the codons of cell cycle dependent genes (CDK1 and NUF2) to study their effects on cell cycle as well as on the apoptosis in vitro. We observed that codon optimization alters the cell cycle length in cell cycle dependent genes. Codon changes further influence cell fate and survival, highlighting the impact of codon usage on cellular outcomes. Apart from affecting the functional aspects of the proteins, our studies revealed that codon usage preferences directly affect the stability of both mRNA and proteins. Specifically, genes and proteins with non-optimal codons exhibited reduced stability compared to their optimized counterparts, suggesting critical implications for cell cycle regulation and apoptosis.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

However, high resolution insight into RT-induced compositional alterations in ribosomes remain unexplored. Therefore, the purpose of this study was twofold: 1) develop a protocol sufficient to enrich and examine the ribosomal proteome from a small amount of human muscle tissue, and 2) determine if ribosomal protein composition differs between higher and lower responders to RT. Fourteen participants completed 10 weeks of RT (23 sessions) and were stratified into higher (n=7) and lower (n=7) responders based on changes in vastus lateralis muscle cross-sectional area (VL mCSA) and mean myofiber cross-sectional area (fCSA) from baseline (PRE) to after the 23rd RT session (POST). Participants then performed a twenty fourth RT session and biopsies were collected 24 hours post-RT (POST-24h) to examine acute bout (POST to POST-24h) ribosomal proteome alterations to RT. Ribosome enrichment and analysis included ultracentrifugation (100,000 g, 3h, 2 degrees C) through 20% sucrose gradients followed by shotgun proteomics to quantify ribosomal protein composition. Our protocol produced exceptional ribosome enrichment, with 74 distinct ribosomal proteins being detected (92% coverage of the putative 80 cytosolic ribosomal proteins) as well as ~164-fold and ~71-fold increases in large (RPL) and small (RPS) protein subunit abundances, respectively, compared to conventional tissue homogenization. Despite robust phenotypic differences in hypertrophy between responder groups to the 10-week RT protocol (mCSA: +31% versus +3%; fCSA: +29% versus -2%, P<0.05 for both outcomes), ribosomal protein composition was not significantly different between groups (higher vs. lower responders), nor was there a significant time (POST to POST-24h) or a group*time interaction (P>0.028 for all comparisons). In conclusion, we present a highly effective ribosome enrichment protocol requiring minimal human muscle tissue. Though preliminary analyses indicate that ribosomal protein composition was similar between hypertrophic phenotypes in response to an acute RT session after a 10-week RT intervention, future research leveraging our techniques with more sampling time points are needed to provide more definitive conclusions.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

The aim of this work was to identify and validate the Cry1A cadherin receptor in Grapholita molesta (GmCad1). The GmCad1 gene was annotated by Blast genome mining using lepidopteran Bt-related cadherins. The phylogenetic analyses grouped GmCad1 with other Torticidae cadherins, in a different clade than the lepidopteran Bt-related cadherins. The in silico analysis of the GmCad1 showed a structure similar to that of the Bt-related cadherins, with 11 cadherin repeats (CRs), a transmembrane region, and an intracellular domain. The full-length mRNA sequencing confirmed GmCad1 expression in vivo in G. molesta guts. To validate the binding ability of Cry1A proteins to GmCad1, a cadherin fragment (CR7-CR11) was expressed and in vitro binding was studied demonstrating that Cry1Aa, Cry1Ab, and Cry1Ac bind to this region in a dose-dependent manner. In silico molecular docking analysis suggested that the interaction may involve mainly the Domains II of Cry1Ab and Cry1Ac, and the Domain III of Cry1Aa.

J.; Parent, C.; Massol, F.; Waters, M.

We frame this idea under the Ecological Coherence (EC) framework, which generalizes previous notions such as community synchrony or coherence. EC captures the structure of co-responses among taxa within assemblages and can be expressed through two complementary objects: (1) the co-response matrix , which contains all pairwise correlations between taxa and can be used to identify clusters of taxa with coherent responses as well as the contributions of individual species to community-wide coherence; and (2) the EC distribution, which summarizes the overall profile of co-responses by capturing their shape, spread, and central tendency across the community. By combining these two views, EC moves beyond single summary metrics and provides a richer picture of how coherence is organized within communities. Analyzing the EC distribution across 341 terrestrial and 105 marine assemblages worldwide, we found a general prevalence of weak correlations and a few strong, directional correlations. We also found that it varies with community composition, sampling effort, and biogeographic region. Moreover, the C matrix consistently identified a small subset of taxa with strong correlations to many others, suggesting a promising path to detecting those that may play central roles in amplifying or buffering community responses to environmental change. Our findings on EC pave the way for deeper investigations into what drives the diversity of ecological responses to environmental changes and how it shapes community dynamics, while also underscoring the need for strategically distributing ecological monitoring across trophic guilds and functional roles.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

To better survey the functional and structural diversity of rubisco, we systematically sampled and synthesized a library of diverse rubisco sequences with an emphasis on clades that have previously not been characterized. Our updated phylogenetic analysis reveals that many deep-branching rubiscos assemble as dimers, supporting a dimeric origin for the superfamily -- in contrast to the ecologically dominant hexadecameric formI. Additionally, we discover and structurally characterize the largest rubisco described to date, originating from a cryptic, early-branching subclade with novel structural folds that have previously not been observed in the rubisco superfamily.

Intrinsically disordered histone tails were previously recognized as key modulators of chromatin states. However, detailed atomistic mechanisms by which histone tail dynamics are associated with chromatin compaction and higher-order chromatin organization remain poorly understood. In this work, we combine extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of tri-nucleosomes with cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) of native nucleosome arrays to investigate histone tail-mediated chromatin folding. Our approach offers distinct advantages as it elucidates realistic inter- and intra-nucleosomal interactions and DNA conformations derived from physics-based MD simulations, enabling a more accurate and physically grounded interpretation of Cryo-ET data. The results reveal that histone tails promote chromatin compaction and constrain tri-nucleosome unfolding via three major patterns: through histone-DNA interactions, histone H2A-H4 and H3-H4 tail-tail interactions. Notably, the distributions of MD-generated structural parameters of tri-nucleosomes with truncated histone tails were found to be in strong agreement with those of experimental open chromatin arrays with widely spaced nucleosomes, whereas the system with histone tails resembled more condensed chromatin. These findings provide mechanistic insights into how histone tails may mediate chromatin folding at the atomistic scale and underscore the dual role of histone tails in both structural compaction and inter-nucleosomal communication.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

The goal of designing biochemical circuits in synthetic biology is to make modular and tractable systems that perform well with predictable behaviors. Developing formalisms towards the design of such systems has proven to be difficult with the diverse retroactive effects that appear with respect to the context of the cell. Repressor-based circuits have various applications in biosynthesis, therapeutics, and bioremediation. Particularly using CRISPRi, competition for components of the system (unbound dCas9) can affect the achievable dynamic range of repression. Moreover, the toxicity of dCas9 via non-specific binding inhibits high levels of expression and limits the performance of genetic circuits. In this work, we study the computation of Boolean functions through CRISPRi based circuits built out of NOT and NOR gates. We provide algebraic expressions that allow us to evaluate the steady-state behaviors of any realized circuit. Our mathematical analysis reveals that the effective non-cooperativity of any given gate is a major bottleneck for increasing the dynamic range of the outputs. Further, we find that under the condition of competition between promoters for dCas9, certain circuit architectures perform better than others depending on factors such as circuit depth, fan-in, and fan-out. We pose optimization problems to evaluate the effects engineerable parameter values to find regimes in which a given circuit performs best.

Genome mining has revealed many predicted siderophore biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in bacterial genomes, however the structures of their siderophore products remain mostly undetermined. This limits our molecular-level understanding of how bacteria acquire iron, as well as how they interact with other taxa that may use the same siderophores within bacterial communities. Here, we apply inverse stable isotope labeling (InverSIL) to rapidly connect predicted siderophore BGCs to their products. With InverSIL, bacteria are grown on 13C-substituted carbon sources and then fed predicted biosynthetic precursors at their natural isotopic abundance to identify BGC products by mass spectrometry, which removes issues with the availability of isotopically substituted precursors. We use InverSIL to determine the structures of the siderophore products of predicted BGCs from the methylotrophic genera Methylophilus and Methylobacterium, and the siderophores produced by the opportunistic pathogen Chromobacterium violaceum, which were previously shown to be essential for virulence yet remained structurally uncharacterized. We next use this approach to reveal the unexpected production of enterobactin by the genera Kushneria and Paracoccus, which was difficult to predict from genome sequences due to the distributed nature of the biosynthetic genes within the genomes. Finally, we use InverSIL to discover new siderophores, cellulochelin A and B, from the cellulose-degrading plant symbiont Cellulomonas sp. strain Leaf334.

We demonstrate that the Notch signaling pathway, a key regulator of stem cell maintenance and differentiation, functions as a barrier to HCMV reactivation. Two viral gene products, UL8 and miR-UL36, modulate this pathway during reactivation. UL8 promotes degradation of the Notch3 receptor via the endosomal/lysosomal pathway, dependent on two tyrosine-based motifs (Y305/314) in its cytoplasmic tail. A UL8 mutant lacking these motifs fails to degrade Notch3, resulting in sustained Notch signaling and impaired reactivation in vitro and in humanized mice. Similarly, miR-UL36 reduces expression of Notch3 and the Notch transcription factor Recombination Signal Binding Protein For Immunoglobulin Kappa J Region (RBPJ), suppressing Notch signaling. Deletion of miR-UL36 inhibits reactivation, but this defect, like that of the UL8 mutant, can be rescued by pharmacologic Notch inhibition. Thus, HCMV employs multiple gene products to suppress Notch signaling and promote conditions conducive to reactivation. These findings reveal how HCMV manipulates host differentiation pathways to control latency and suggest therapeutic strategies to prevent viral recurrence in immunocompromised patients.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

While calcium-, lipid-, and kinase-based signalling pathways have been partially elucidated, how these cues are translated into mechanical force remains unclear. Here, we uncover a dual methyltransferase mechanism that orchestrates this process. We identify PCKMT, a preconoidal ring-associated lysine methyltransferase, as an essential upstream regulator of motility. PCKMT anchors the actin nucleator Formin-1 (FRM1) at the conoid, enabling conoid protrusion and F-actin assembly. Loss of PCKMT abolishes FRM1 recruitment, blocks conoid extrusion, and arrests invasion and egress despite preserved conoid structure. In contrast, the apical methyltransferase AKMT, previously linked to motility through recruitment of the glideosome-associated connector (GAC), acts downstream, disengaging from the conoid upon activation and likely promoting GAC-dependent force transmission. PCKMT depletion prevents AKMT translocation, revealing that actin assembly and lysine methylation are mechanistically coupled. Together, these findings define a two-step methylation checkpoint that coordinates actin nucleation with force propagation, uncovering methylation as a central regulatory axis for motility initiation in apicomplexan parasites.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have shown that the TFIIH subunit Tfb3 connects TFIIH to the rest of the PIC via interactions with (i) Pol II, (ii) TFIIE, and (iii) other TFIIH components. Activities within the PIC that influence TSS selection can do so by control of initiation efficiency at individual TSSs and by control of TSS scanning (either rate of scanning or scanning processivity). Here, we identified classes of tfb3 and tfa1 mutants within the TFIIH-Pol II-TFIIE interface able to alter promoter scanning in either upstream or downstream directions, suggesting that changes to this interface can fine-tune scanning behavior through evolution. Mutants were isolated based on transcriptional phenotypes and were validated for changes to promoter-specific TSS usage at ADH1. Subsets of alleles were analyzed using TSS sequencing approaches, showing that tested tfb3 and tfa1 alleles shift TSS distributions across most genomic promoters.

Chem-CLIP-Map-Seq in MDA-MB-231 cells identified 723 RNA targets and their binding sites, revealing a strong bias toward 5'; and 3'; untranslated regions (UTRs) in mRNAs and enrichment at thermodynamically stable structures, with limited binding to non-coding RNAs. Expression level and local stability contributed to engagement. An integrated machine-learning model trained on multiple fingerprints distinguished binders from non-binders, and highlighted chemotypes and physicochemical features that favor RNA recognition. Four fragments were converted to a Ribonuclease Targeting Chimera (RiboTAC) to recruit Rnase L to degrade targeted mRNAs. Despite broad binding, cleavage was highly selective, with X1-RiboTAC degrading MPP7 and SSC4D mRNAs in an RNase L-dependent manner and reducing their protein levels. A competitive profiling workflow quantified in-cell target occupancy and guided optimization of the RNA-binding module to reprogram selectivity: an X1 derivative produced an MPP7-selective RiboTAC that lowered MPP7 mRNA levels and suppressed breast-cancer cell migration, while sparing SSC4D transcripts.

Here, we provide the first experimental characterization of a conotoxin from the MKAVA superfamily, conkazal-M1, from Conus magus. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that conkazal-M1 adopts a fold characteristic of the Kazal-type protease inhibitor family, featuring a Glu residue at the inhibitory P1 position. Recombinantly expressed conkazal-M1 inhibits the proteolytic activity of Subtilisin A with an apparent Ki of 1.1 M. In addition, conkazal-M1 partially inhibits calcium transients in mouse sensory neurons, suggesting a potential role in modulating ion-channel activity as seen for many other toxins. The dual function of conkazal-M1 in protease inhibition and neuroactivity is analogous to the dual function of several toxins harboring a Kunitz-type fold. The well-conserved sequence of the MKAVAs indicates an evolutionary trajectory where these proteins face an adaptive conflict when mutations that enhance one activity compromise the other. Collectively, this work provides new structural and functional insight into a previously uncharacterized toxin superfamily in cone snails and expands our knowledge about the toxin arsenal available to venomous animals.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

T.; Saito, K.", "abstract": "Chemical modifications of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are integral to their stability and to translation. Loss of N7-methylguanosine (m7G) on specific tRNAs reduces their steady-state abundance and impairs translation in mammals, but whether these decreases reflect active degradation under physiological growth conditions is unresolved. Here, using human HCT116 cells, we show that knockdown of the 5'[-&gt;]3' exonuclease, XRN2, restores tRNA levels diminished by METTL1 depletion. Leveraging conditional protein knockdown, we performed time-resolved measurements of mature tRNA levels and directly quantified decay kinetics. We show that in the absence of heat stress, mG-hypomodified tRNAs undergo XRN2-dependent accelerated decay. Finally, partial loss of the Drosophila XRN2 ortholog, Rat1, genetically rescues male sterility of mettl1 mutants, demonstrating organismal relevance. These findings define a conserved constitutive rapid tRNA decay pathway in mammals and indicate inhibition of tRNA decay as a potential therapeutic strategy in disorders caused by tRNA hypomodification.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Aberrant 5-Methylcytosine tRNA Modification Disrupts Proteostasis and Exacerbates Age-Related Osteoporosis", "doi": "10.1101/2025.11.04.686482", "authors": "Peng, Z.; Peng, N.; Yuan, M.; Yan, F.; Jiang, T.; Ye, M.; Xiao, Y.", "abstract": "Age-related protein aggregation drives senile osteoporosis. Aberrant tRNA modifications exacerbate the progression, yet mechanisms linking these to bone loss remain unclear. In this study, we identify Nsun2 (m5C methyltransferase) as key regulator: age-dependent Nsun2 downregulation in BMSCs reduces m5C levels of tRNAs, destabilizing tRNAs and impairing translation efficiency of specific transcripts. This directly disrupts the protein synthesis of molecular chaperone and pro-osteogenic factors, accelerating misfolded protein aggregates and activating unfolded protein response, inducing BMSCs senescence and impairing osteogenesis. Mice specifically depleted of Nsun2 exhibited reduced bone mass, whereas mice overexpressing Nsun2 alleviated age-associated bone loss. Notably, the exacerbated protein aggregation and bone mass loss in Nsun2-deficient mice were ameliorated following treatment with the molecular chaperone activator-ML346. Remarkably, ML346 administration proved sufficient to reverse age-related functional deficits in aged mice. Overall, our findings demonstrate that aberrant tRNA-m5C modification alters protein synthesis and induces proteostasis collapse, which constitute a novel contributor to the pathogenesis of senile osteoporosis. Additionally, reduction of protein aggregation through the activation of molecular chaperones presents a promising therapeutic strategy for this disease.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

E.; Stewart, C.; Pavelko, H. M.; Burton, T. A.; Ebel, G. D.; Fauver, J. R.; Foy, B. D.", "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) transmission risk is typically estimated from pooled whole-mosquito infection data, which may overestimate the proportion of mosquitoes capable of transmission. To assess natural viral dissemination in field-collected Culex tarsalis, we tested infection rates in tissues of 1,793 individual mosquitoes collected from Northern Colorado in August, 2023. Fifteen mosquitoes had detectable abdominal infections, but WNV RNA was detected in only 53% (8/15) of their thorax and head tissues, while another 27% (4/15) had WNV RNA detected in either the thorax or the head alone. Logistic regression suggests an inconsistent relationship between abdominal viral RNA load and virus dissemination, whereas receiver operating characteristic analysis identifies a threshold of ~59,000 RNA copies in the abdomen predictive of dissemination (AUC 0.80, 95% CI: 0.545, 1). These results suggest whole-body RNA detection may overestimate transmission potential from field-captured mosquitoes, and that incorporating infection data could refine surveillance-based risk indices for WNV.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

While association with Durusdinium is known to confer thermotolerance, it has also been linked to coral tissue loss under stress. We investigated whether algal type influences host immunity and stress responses in the tropical coral Pocillopora acuta. Durusdinium-hosting (D-hosting) P. acuta have distinct transcriptomic profiles, higher immune-related gene expression, and elevated baseline levels of immunity transcription factor NF-{kappa}B as compared to corals hosting Cladocopium (C-hosting). Under heat challenge, D-hosting P. acuta exhibited tissue loss, oxidative stress, immune and microbial dysregulation, whereas C-hosting P. acuta were more susceptible to bleaching, metabolic dysregulation, and decline in nitrogen-fixing and antioxidant-producing bacteria. Finally, Vibrio coralliilyticus infection caused high tissue loss in D-hosting corals, but not in C-hosting corals. Our results suggest a mechanistic explanation for how Durusdinium association enhances thermotolerance yet predisposes corals to tissue damage under stress revealing immune trade-offs that can compromise host survival under multiple stressors.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}

The Dalbergioids diverged from the IRLC early in legume evolution and possess unique symbiotic features but few genetically tractable models. The small, diploid Dalbergioid Aeschynomene americana (American jointvetch) has promise as a genetic model for Dalbergioid-rhizobia symbiosis, yet only a few studies have examined its symbiotic properties. We examined the symbiont range of A. americana from central Florida and characterized a native A. americana nodule isolate, Bradyrhizobium sp. USDA3516. We find that A. americana forms effective symbioses with B. sp. USDA3516, which is closely related to Thai A. americana symbiont B. sp DOA9, and with symbionts from the Dalbergioids stylo and peanut. Interestingly, several strains that effectively nodulated A. americana exhibited branched bacteroid morphologies, but we found that branching was neither necessary nor sufficient for effective symbiosis. Our study contradicts the prevailing view that bacteroid shape is a major determinant of symbiotic efficiency and presents the A. americana-B. sp. USDA3516 interaction as an optimal model of A. americana symbiosis.", "date": "2025-11-05", "journal": ""}
