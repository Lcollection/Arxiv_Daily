However, the extent to which bacteria detect activated neutrophils or the HOCl that neutrophils produce, has not been understood. Here we report that the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa upregulates expression of its fro operon in response to stimulated neutrophils. This operon was previously shown to be activated by shear rate of fluid flow in the environment. We show that fro is specifically upregulated by HOCl, while other oxidative factors that neutrophils produce including H2O2, do not upregulate fro. The fro-dependent response to HOCl upregulates the expression of multiple methionine sulfoxide reductases, which relieve oxidative stress that would otherwise inhibit growth. Our findings suggest a model in which the detection of shear rate or HOCl activates the fro operon, which serves as an early and sensitive host-detection system for P. aeruginosa that improves its own survival against neutrophil-mediated host defenses. In support of this model, we found that the fro operon is activated in an infection model where flow and neutrophils are present. This response could promote the bacterium's pathogenicity, colonization of tissue, and persistence in infections.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Amyloid aggregates and neuro-signaling impairments may also expose AD patients to peripheral nervous system deficits, promoting cardiac disorders. Here, we characterize cardiac physiology, amyloid pathology, neurotrophic factors loss, and the impoverishment of cardiac neuronal fibers in Tg2576-AD mice hearts, human cardiomyocytes in culture, and human AD post-mortem left ventricular (LV) heart tissue. We reveal that Tg2576 animals exhibit increased myocardial fibrosis, amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) deposition, and brain/heart-axis neurotrophic deficiencies, resulting in myocardial denervation and cardiac dysfunction. A{beta} oligomers reduce BDNF expression in both human immortalized and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes by disrupting TrkB/CREB signaling.

It constitutes the molecular basis of the process of calcium-induced calcium release where activation of RyR2s can be locally regenerative giving rise to local release events termed Ca2+ sparks. Accordingly, the molecular distribution of RyR2 in cardiac myocytes has been of great interest. Here we present the first purely optical data of RyR2 distribution with sub-molecular resolution by applying 3D MINFLUX fluorescence super-resolution microscopy. We demonstrate that by using single-domain antibodies (sdABs) against fluorescent protein domains in engineered RyR2 fluorescent protein fusions we can determine the location of individual RyR2 subunits with high precision (~3 nm) in all directions. Combining MINFLUX with DNA-PAINT, to maximize detection efficiency, we measured in situ labeling efficiencies using NPC structures as reference and regularly achieved efficiencies around 50%, which would translate to RyR2 detection efficiencies close to 95%, i.e. the probability that at least one subunit is detected, if target accessibility is similar. Using this approach, we detect dense and extended RyR2 expression in HEK cells with some clusters spanning several micrometres in extent and containing several hundred RyR2s. Similarly, myocytes from PA-RFP RyR2 mice contained large clusters containing many tens of RyR2s. The new data also suggests a resolution to apparent discrepancies between previous data from electron microscopy and super-resolution data. The methodology developed here will be critical to reveal the full complexity of RyR2 and related Ca2+ handling proteins in 3D as well as their relationship to contractile function. Our new approaches should be applicable to other multi-subunit complexes in cardiac muscle and other cell types.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Rapid climate change necessitates the development of heat-stress resilient plants. Elevated temperatures perturb cellular protein homeostasis, and its timely restoration is critical for plant survival post-stress. Thermopriming, which involves pre-exposure to sublethal heat stress, has emerged as a promising approach to enhance heat stress tolerance. However, the impact of thermopriming on protein homeostasis remains unclear. This study demonstrates that priming-mediated short-term acquired thermotolerance involves dynamic regulation of protein maintenance (HSPs) and clearance (autophagy) mechanisms. Priming facilitates an increase in HSP abundance through HSFA1 activation. Concurrently, priming induces autophagy through dynamic modulation of autophagy-negative regulators through IRE1's-mRNA degradation activity. Contrarily, unprimed seedlings fail to exhibit such coordinated regulation, resulting in disrupted proteostasis and fail to survive. While the loss of IRE1 had minimal impact on priming-mediated outcomes, HSFA1 proved essential, as its absence led to lethality under heat stress. This underscores the critical role of protein maintenance mechanisms over clearance pathways in ensuring survival. Taken together, our study demonstrates that thermopriming enhances heat stress resilience by temporally coordinating autophagy and chaperone responses to maintain proteostasis.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Although many studies have elucidated the mechanisms that drive HS-induced activation of stress response genes across species, little is known about the mechanisms that repress constitutively expressed genes. Using nascent RNA-sequencing, we determined that CLAMP (Chromatin-linked adaptor for MSL complex proteins) is a critical GA-binding transcription factor (TF) that drives 75% of the Heat shock (HS) induced repression in Drosophila, a well-established model for understanding the mechanisms of heat stress-regulated gene regulation. Using Micro-C, we demonstrate for the first time that heat stress induces widespread changes in local 3D chromatin organization at chromatin loops, which are significantly associated with HS-induced transcriptional changes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CLAMP regulates 3D chromatin loop formation and HS-induced repression through both direct and indirect mechanisms. Overall, we demonstrate that CLAMP is the first sequence-specific transcription factor identified that targets HS-dependent transcriptional repression by suppressing 3D chromatin loop anchor formation during HS and also present the highest resolution heat stress 3D genomic dataset available in Drosophila, which provides a key resource for generating mechanistic insight into how temperature regulates 3D genomic contacts.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

We leveraged fMRI-based pattern similarity, receptive field modeling, and eye tracking to test this hypothesis in humans performing a memory-dependent visual search task. In the hippocampus, differentiation of competing memories predicted the accuracy of memory-guided eye movements. In visual cortex, preparatory coding of remembered target locations predicted search successes, whereas preparatory coding of competing locations predicted search failures due to interference. These effects were linked: stronger hippocampal memory differentiation was associated with lower competitor activation in visual cortex, yielding more precise preparatory representations.

Efficient migration is critical for antitumoral T cells to locate and eliminate cancer cells. To investigate the upper limits of cell speed, we developed a hybrid stochastic-mean field model of bleb-based cell motility. Our model demonstrates that cell-matrix adhesion-free bleb-based migration is highly inefficient, challenging the feasibility of cell swimming/adhesion-independent migration as a primary motility mode. Instead, we show that T cells can achieve rapid migration by combining bleb formation with adhesion-based forces. Supporting our predictions, our three-dimensional gel experiments confirm that T cells migrate significantly faster under adherent conditions than in adhesion-free environments. These findings highlight the mechanical constraints of T cell motility and suggest that modifying tissue adhesion properties in a controlled manner could enhance immune cell infiltration into tumors. Our computational and experimental work provides insights for optimizing T cell-based immunotherapies.

One example is identification of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) types and their visual response properties, which is fundamental for developing future electronic implants that can restore vision. Approach: The electrical image (EI) of a RGC, or the mean spatio-temporal voltage footprint of its recorded spikes on a high-density electrode array, contains substantial information about its anatomical, morphological, and functional properties. However, the analysis of these properties is complex because of the high-dimensional nature of the EI. We present a novel optimization-based algorithm to decompose electrical image into a low-dimensional, biophysically-based representation: the temporally-shifted superposition of three learned basis waveforms corresponding to spike waveforms produced in the somatic, dendritic and axonal cellular compartments. Results: The decomposition was evaluated using large-scale multi-electrode recordings from the macaque retina. The decomposition accurately localized the somatic and dendritic compartments of the cell. The imputed dendritic fields of RGCs correctly predicted the location and shape of their visual receptive fields. The inferred waveform amplitudes and shapes accurately identified the four major primate RGC types (ON and OFF midget and parasol cells) substantially more accurately than previous approaches.

After estimating a latent cell ordering, statistical models are used to determine which genes exhibit changes in expression that are significantly associated with progression through the biological trajectory.

As such, the results can be di[ff]icult to interpret, and biological conclusions often rest on subjective visual inspections of the most dynamic genes.

In addition, extensions to estimating equations and mixed models allow for reliable trajectory testing under complex experimental designs. After validating the accuracy of scLANE under several different simulation scenarios, we apply it to a set of diverse biological datasets and display its ability to provide novel biological information when used downstream of both pseudotime and RNA velocity estimation methods. scLANE is freely available as an R package and is also accessible via a web server leveraging high performance computing resources at https://sclane.rc.ufl.edu/.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Unlike previous diffusion models, which often fail to capture the nuanced combinatorial patterns of regulatory elements, D3 effectively recapitulates cell-type-specific activity and motif organization. We also show that D3 learns informative representations even in the absence of conditioning labels, outperforming genomic language models and supervised models trained on naive one-hot encodings.

By overexpressing or knocking down expression of c-di-AMP synthase genes, we made strains producing different levels of c-di-AMP, which we linked to changes in secondary differentiation status. Increases in c-di-AMP resulted in an earlier increase in transcription of EB-associated genes, and this was further manifested in earlier production of EBs.

Elucidation of molecular mechanisms in HALI could identify therapeutic targets in ALI. In the current study, we examined in vivo effects of HALI on Beclin-1 (BCN1), a molecule that regulates autophagy and cell death. Effects of HALI on BCN1 and autophagy markers were examined in wildtype mice. Analysis of BCN1 and autophagy was completed via Western blot, RT-qPCR, and immunohistochemistry. In wildtype mice, HALI led to increased BCN1 in the lung and in the alveolar epithelium. HALI resulted in significant alterations in markers of autophagy in the lung, including reduced microtubule-associated protein 1B-light chain (LC3B)-II/-I ratios, suggesting reduced autophagic flux. HALI caused increased LDH release in human alveolar type-II cells derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (AT2siPSC), as well as reduced LC3B-II/-I ratios. We previously showed that inhibition of the tyrosine kinase receptor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is protective in HALI. EGFRWa5/+ mice, which have genetically reduced EGFR activity and improved survival in HALI, showed increased total BCN1, reduced phosphorylated-(p-)/total BCN1 ratios, and decreased LC3B-II/-I ratios in the lung in HALI compared with wildtype. Administration of wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor which decreases BCN1-mediated autophagy, led to increased mortality in HALI in wildtype mice.

We show that hypothalamic orexin/hypocretin-producing neurons (HONs) are exceptionally precise movement-trackers, encoding net body movement across multiple classified behaviors with a high degree of precision, independent of head acceleration. This tracking was so precise, that video analysis of the mouse body movement reliably served as a low-cost biometric for HON population activity. The movement tracking was independent of internal nutritional states, and occurred in a communication bandwidth distinct from HON encoding of blood glucose. At key projection targets, orexin/hypocretin peptide outputs correlated with self-initiated movement in a projection-specific manner, indicating functional heterogeneity in HON outputs. Finally, we found that body movement was not encoded to the same extent in other key neural populations related to arousal or energy.

We applied FORCE training to leaky integrate-and-fire spiking networks and their matched rate-based counterparts across various dynamical tasks, keeping the FORCE hyperparameters identical. We found that at slow learning rates, spiking and rate networks behaved similarly: FORCE training identified highly correlated weight matrix solutions, and both network types exhibited overlapping hyperparameter regions for successful convergence. Remarkably, these weight solutions were largely interchangeable--weights trained in the spiking network could be transferred to the rate network and vice versa while preserving correct dynamical decoding. However, at fast learning rates, the correlation between learned solutions dropped sharply, and the solutions were no longer fully interchangeable. Despite this, rate networks still functioned well when their weight matrices were replaced with those learned from spiking networks. Additionally, the two network types exhibited distinct behaviors across different sizes: faster learning improved performance in rate networks but had little effect in spiking networks, aside from increasing instability. Our results indicate that some of the difficulties in training spiking networks stem from the inherent spike-time variability in spiking systems--variability that is not present in rate networks. These challenges can be mitigated in FORCE training by selecting appropriately slow learning rates. Moreover, our findings suggest that the decoding solutions learned by FORCE for spiking networks approximate a cross-trial firing rate-based decoding.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Here we demonstrate that this prewetting transition becomes exquisitely sensitive to lipid composition when membranes have compositions near the boundary of liquid-ordered/liquid-disordered phase coexistence. In simulation and reconstitution, we couple polyelectrolytes to membranes of saturated lipids, unsaturated lipids, and cholesterol, and find that the coexistence of prewet and dry surface phases is dramatically potentiated by proximity to the membrane phase transition. In cells, we employ an optogenetic tool to characterize prewetting both at the plasma membranes (PM) and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and find that prewetting is potentiated or inhibited by perturbations of membrane composition. Prewetting can also mediate membrane adhesion, with avidity dependent on membrane composition. This effect is demonstrated in cells through the potentiation or inhibition of ER-PM contact sites. The strong correspondence between results in simulation, reconstitution, and cells demonstrates a new role for membrane lipids in regulating the recruitment and assembly of soluble proteins.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we describe the immunophenotypic identification of a CD34- colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) progenitor subtype, termed late CFU-E (lateC), that arises in an Epo-dependent manner during human early erythropoiesis (EE). LateC cells lack CD235a (glycophorin A) but have high levels of CD71 and CD105, characterized as Lin-CD123-CD235a-CD49d+CD117+CD34-CD71hiCD105hi. Analysis of ex vivo cultures of bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells showed that acquisition of the CD71hiCD105hi phenotype in lateC occurs through the formation of four other EE subtypes. Of these, two are CD34+ burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cells, distinguishable as CD71loCD105lo early BFU-E (earlyB) and CD71hiCD105lo late BFU-E (lateB), and two are CD34- CFU-E, also distinguishable as CD71loCD105lo early CFU-E (earlyC) and CD71hiCD105lo mid CFU-E (midC). The EE transitions are accompanied by a rise in CD36 expression, such that all lateC cells are CD36+. Patterns of CD34, CD36, and CD71 indicate two differentiation routes; in one earlyB lose CD34 to form earlyC, and in another, earlyB gain CD36 and CD71hi expression prior to losing CD34 to form midC, bypassing the earlyC stage. Regardless of the route, the transition from midC to lateC requires Epo. All five EE subtypes could be prospectively detected in human BM cells and, upon isolation and reculture, exhibited the potential to continue differentiating along the erythroid trajectory. Finally, we find that all five EE populations can also be detected in cultures of cord blood-derived CD34+ cells at levels similar to those observed in BM CD34+ cell cultures.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

We sought to build a transcriptomic, cellular, and spatial atlas of human arterial cells across multiple different arterial segments to understand these phenomena. Analysis of multiple isogenic arterial segments from healthy donors revealed a significant stereotyped pattern of cell type-specific segmental heterogeneity in healthy arteries. Combining single cell with spatial transcriptomic revealed cellular heterogeneity not captured by commonly used cell-type marker genes. Determinants of arterial transcriptomic identity are predominantly encoded in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells (SMC), and their differentially expressed genes are particularly enriched for different vascular disease-associated genetic risk-loci and risk-genes. Adventitial fibroblast-specific heterogeneity in gene expression coincides with a disproportionally large number of vascular disease genetic signals, suggesting a previously unrecognized role for this cell type in disease risk. Adult arterial cells from different segments cluster not by anatomical proximity but by embryonic origin. Global regulon analysis of disease related segment-specific gene expression program in fibroblast and SMC enriches for binding sites of transcription factors that are developmental master regulators whose expression persists into adulthood, suggesting an important functional role of the same developmental master regulators in adult gene expression and disease. Lastly, non-coding transcriptomes across arterial cells contain extensive variation in lncRNAs expressed in cell type- and segment-specific patterns, rivaling heterogeneity in protein coding transcriptomes. Differentially expressed LncRNA demonstrate enrichment for non-coding genetic signals for vascular diseases, suggesting a potential global role of segmental specific LncRNAs in regulating inherited human vascular disease risk.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

A total of seventeen species of Tephritidae fruit flies were detected in this survey. The Bactrocera carambolae fruit fly has been discovered for the first time in our survey area, indicating spread of its range towards the north-west region from its previous detection sites (Chattogram and Sylhet Divisions) in Bangladesh. Among the detected pest species, we identified six abundant species: Bactrocera dorsalis, Zeugodacus cucurbitae, Zeugodacus tau, Bactrocera rubigina, Bactrocera zonata, and Dacus longicornis. The most abundant species was the polyphagous fruit pest B. dorsalis, comprising 76.83% of all captured flies. The species Z. cucurbitae was the second most abundant, representing 13.82% of the total trapped flies. The fitted curve to survey data using Gaussian mixture model revealed the existence of overlapped subgroups in the population of B. dorsalis and Z. cucurbitae.

While all eutherian mammals have placentas composed of fetal-derived trophoblasts that mediate maternal-fetal exchange, their anatomical and histological structures vary across species due to evolutionary divergence. Despite the cellular heterogeneity of porcine trophoblasts in vivo, understanding the mechanisms driving porcine placental development has been limited by the lack of in vitro models replicating this heterogeneity. In this study, we derived swine trophoblast organoids (sTOs) from full-term porcine placentas, retaining key transcriptional signatures of in vivo trophoblasts. To identify conserved cell populations, we integrated Visium spatial transcriptomics from mid-gestation porcine placentas with single-cell transcriptomics from sTOs. Spatial transcriptomics revealed novel markers of the porcine uterus and placenta, enabling precise separation of histological structures at the maternal-fetal interface. The integration of tissue and sTO transcriptomics showed that sTOs spontaneously differentiate into distinct trophoblast populations, with conserved gene expression and cell communication programs. These findings demonstrate that sTOs recapitulate porcine placental trophoblast populations, offering a powerful model for advancing placentation research.

However, our understanding of the zooplankton physiological response to nutrient variability in their living environment, particularly at the gene expression level, remains limited. This knowledge gap hinders our understanding of their physiological processes, which are essential for the biogeochemical cycle. To investigate the impact of coastal environmental nutrient heterogeneity on zooplankton community physiology, we conducted zooplankton samplings during the summer season in the western, southern, and eastern Coastal Hong Kong Waters. Meta transcriptomics analysis was employed to unravel the community composition and gene expression profiles of the sampled zooplankton. Our study revealed distinct patterns of differential gene expression associated with nitrogen and amino acid metabolism functions within the sampled zooplankton communities across the different sampling regions. Furthermore, we found several KEGG pathway members of gene modules which are classified as metabolism functions that highly correlated with nutrient concentrations. Importantly, these gene expression patterns corresponded to the observed heterogeneity in dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorous concentration within coastal waters environment. To further validate our findings, we conducted reanalysis on the zooplankton model organism, Daphnia magna, transcriptome data under laboratory nitrogen and phosphorous imbalanced treatment which the result supported the gene ontology functions identified in the zooplankton community meta transcriptome.

Previous studies suggest that anionic lipids are necessary for this binding. However, these studies largely focused on unmodified aSyn, while physiological aSyn is N-terminally acetylated (NTA). Our work challenges the long-standing paradigm that anionic lipids are necessary for aSyn binding by demonstrating that NTA diminishes aSyn's reliance on anionic membrane charge, revealing that membrane packing defects (i.e., interfacial hydrophobicity) alone can drive membrane binding. Using fluorescence microscopy and circular dichroism spectroscopy, we monitored the binding of NTA-aSyn to membrane vesicles with different lipid compositions. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine concentrations were varied to control surface charge, while phospholipid tail unsaturation and methylation were varied to modulate lipid packing. We also formulated cholesterol-containing membranes that mimicked the lipid composition of synaptic vesicles. In these membranes, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to visualize and quantify membrane packing defects. Our results demonstrate that membrane packing defects are necessary for NTA-aSyn binding and that defect-rich membranes are sufficient for NTA-aSyn binding regardless of membrane charge. These findings provide a molecular mechanism by which lipid structural properties, such as poly-unsaturation, can regulate aSyn binding to physiological membranes.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

The thermal stability of NBD1 was also evaluated through its tertiary constrained noncovalent interaction networks or thermoring structures. The results demonstrated that Trikafta binding to flexible TMD1 and TMD2 rearranged their interactions with the R domain upon phosphorylation, coupling tightened cytoplasmic TMD1-TMD2 interactions to tightened Mg/ATP-dependent NBD1-NBD2 dimerization, which stabilized NBD1 above human body temperature. In essence, while the F508 deletion primarily causes a thermal defect in NBD1, leading to a gating defect at the TMD1-TMD2 interface, Trikafta allosterically reverses these effects.

In this study, we propose a model relating corrective ground reaction forces (Fcorr) to preceding COM position (PCOM) and velocity (VCOM). We first checked the model's validity by simulating an inverted pendulum model with known intrinsic and feedback parameters, to see whether and to what extend we could effectively identify the feedback parameters. Next, we tested the model in 15 young adult volunteers in standing. Our model effectively reconstructed Fcorr in both simulations (Fcorr: 0.77~0.99) and human experimental data (Fcorr: 0.92~0.98). The effective delay in the mediolateral direction (239 +/- 20 ms) was significantly shorter than in the anteroposterior direction (271 +/- 28 ms). Additionally, position gains were significantly larger in the mediolateral compared to anteroposterior direction, with values of -1.09 +/- 0.04 and -1.03 +/- 0.02 times critical stiffness, respectively. No significant differences between the directions were found in velocity gains. Our model can be used to identify feedback control in human standing without applying external perturbations or measuring physiology activity.

E.", "abstract": "To rebuild tissue form and function, injured organs accelerate the differentiation of replacement stem cell progeny. Here we demonstrate that injury-induced factors open the throttle on faster differentiation by streamlining the archetypal signaling circuit that patterns cell fates. During normal turnover of the adult Drosophila intestine, fates are patterned by a conserved lateral inhibition circuit: In stem cell pairs, mutual activation of Notch receptor by Delta ligand feeds back to create opposing states of high Notch/low Delta and low Notch/high Delta; cells terminally differentiate once their Notch activity exceeds a fate-deciding threshold. After feeding flies a gut-damaging toxin, we perform in vivo imaging of real-time intestinal repair and trace Notch reporter dynamics in single cells. We find that tissue damage causes the speed of Notch signal activation to accelerate dramatically; faster activation expedites terminal differentiation by propelling cells past the critical Notch threshold more quickly. Combining single-cell analyses with dynamical modeling, we show that faster activation results from aberrant elevation of Delta ligand due to loss of time-delaying circuit feedback. Injury abolishes feedback via a cytokine-JAK-STAT relay from damaged cells to stem cells, causing stem cells to deactivate the Notch co-repressor that normally turns off Delta. Thus, organ injury unmasks latent plasticity in Notch-Delta lateral inhibition to propel the differentiation of new replacement cells. By unifying temporal and spatial fate control in a single, adaptable signaling circuit, organs tune stem cell dynamics to meet environmental challenges.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

We hypothesised that body function constrains both the sense of ownership and sensorimotor control of the body movements. We studied these relationships in the context of control of unilateral goal-directed forward arm reaching movements made with a virtual arm. In addition, we expected that children possess more adaptable body representations compared to adults, facilitating greater acceptance of virtual bodies with altered sensorimotor contingencies. We tested 5-7 and 8-10-year-old children, and young adults. Participants took part in an animal feeding game within a Virtual Reality environment. At each age, we manipulated the virtual arm length (visual gain) to alter reaching functionality in three groups: compared to a normal (100%) condition, reaching arm length was slightly reduced (80%); slightly increased (120%); or greatly increased (400%). Parameters representing reach kinematics, subjective perception of arm length, and subjective limb embodiment were assessed during and after reaching with normal and altered control gain. In addition to changes in their reach kinematics, changes in subjective embodiment and reaching affordance were recorded compared to baseline reaching without altered visual gain. We found that the altered reaching functionality reduced Subjective ratings of limb ownership during exposure to the 400% visual gain modification in the group of adults only. In contrast, changes in reach kinematics occurred in all the age groups of children and adults, with age group-specific adjustments in the motor control strategy, characterised by altered magnitude and spatiotemporal placement of peak velocity as well as smoothness of reaching. Finally, at all ages subjective reaching affordance estimates were enhanced following exposure to the two functionality conditions with increased arm length.

We find that cells exhibit a minimal response to Wnt at certain frequencies, a behavior we term anti-resonance. We developed both detailed biochemical and simplified hidden variable models that explain how anti-resonance emerges from the interplay between fast and slow pathway dynamics. Remarkably, we find that frequency directly influences cell fate decisions involved in human gastrulation; signals delivered at anti-resonant frequencies result in dramatically reduced mesoderm differentiation.

Earlier rainfall onset was associated with more phenologically advanced specimens, a relationship that showed phylogenetic signal. Few climate predictors explained variation in specimen reproduction. The lack of association between specimen reproduction and climate may arise from phenological shifts that buffer impacts of climate, interactions with other species, or challenges in estimating total reproduction from specimens. Our results highlight the value of specimen-tailored growing season conditions for reconstructing climate, incorporating evolutionary relationships in assessing responses to climate, and the complexities of estimating fitness from specimens.

We studied the specimens by using optical and electron beam microanalysis techniques and argue that the cameral deposits consist of primary aragonite and calcite fabrics. A fibrous microstructure, which is bilaterally symmetrically arranged with irregularities, is documented. Thin organic sheets originally delimited radial growth sectors. Based on these observations, we propose a new growth model that explicitly involves the cameral sheets. These sheets acted as an extension of the pellicle and held a thin film of supersaturated liquid in the otherwise emptied chambers by the cameral sheets via the capillary effect. Ions were supplied through the siphuncle, such as in living Nautilus, and enabled the precipitation of aragonite and calcite fabrics. This model goes beyond previous interpretations, resolves contradictory observations and has functional implications, suggesting that cameral sheets and deposits were an adaptation to increased growth rates.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

We use herbarium specimens to explore climate niche evolution across 14 annual species of the Streptanthus (s.l.) clade (Brassicaceae), which originated in deserts and diversified into cooler, moister areas. To understand how climate niches evolved, we used historical climate records to estimate each species' 1) classic annual climate niche, averaged over specimen collection sites; 2) growing season niche, from estimated specimen germination date to collection date, averaged across specimens (specimen-specific niche); and 3) standardized seasonal niche based on average growing seasons of all species (clade-seasonal niche). In addition to estimating how phenological variation maps onto climate niche evolution, we explored how spatial refugia shape the climate experienced by species by 1) analyzing how field soil texture changes relative to the climate space that species occupy and 2) comparing soil water holding capacity from each specimen locality to that of surrounding areas. Specimen-specific niches exhibited less clade-wide variation in climatic water deficit than did annual or clade-seasonal niches, and specimen-specific temperature niches showed no phylogenetic signal, in contrast to annual and clade-seasonal temperature niches. Species occupying cooler regions tracked hotter and drier climates by growing later into the summer, and by inhabiting refugia on drought-prone soils. These results underscore how phenological shifts, spatial refugia, and germination timing shape \"lived\" climate.

Here, we identify a molecular pathway by which melatonin promotes sleep by activating BK channels (Slo1) via MT1 receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the master circadian clock of the brain. In melatonin-proficient CBA/CaJ mice, knockout of either MT1 or Slo1 reduces REM and NREM sleep during the rest phase (daytime), accompanied by prolonged action potentials and diminished afterhyperpolarization in SCN neurons. These electrophysiological and behavioral changes are minimal during the active phase (nighttime). Strikingly, Slo1 expression in the SCN peaks during the daytime, contrary to previous reports, but aligning with its sleep-promoting function. Slo1, but not MT1, deletion also triggers spontaneous seizures, highlighting broader functions beyond circadian control. Structural mapping identifies critical domains mediating MT1-Slo1 coupling.

Cholinergic signaling systems modulate neural excitability to influence information processing in the BLA. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are of particular interest because aberrant mAChR signaling in BLA circuits is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, cognitive impairment, substance use, and age-related cognitive decline. This study evaluates mAChR activation in BLA principal neurons (PNs) in juvenile rat brain slices using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. We found that bath application of carbachol (CCh,) produces a pirenzepine sensitive excitatory response in BLA PNs voltage clamped near the resting potential, which depends on an underlying biphasic change in membrane resistance, indicating an involvement of multiple effectors. More specifically, we observed that CCh excites BLA PNs by inhibiting the afterhyperpolarization (AHP), by reducing a steady state inhibitory current, and by promoting an afterdepolarization (ADP). We further identify and characterize a CCh-induced and calcium-activated non-selective cation current (ICAN) that underlies the ADP in voltage clamp. Overall, our findings provide new insights into specific effectors modulated by activation of pirenzepine sensitive mAChRs expressed by BLA PNs. We also reveal new details about the time- and voltage-dependence of current carried by the CCh -activated ICAN like current in BLA PNs, and highlight its ability to promote a suprathreshold ADP capable of generating sustained firing after a brief excitatory stimulus. Improved understanding of these effectors will provide potentially valuable new insights on the wide range of mechanisms through which cholinergic system dysfunction can lead to impaired executive function.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

From the fluorescence traces, we extract neural assemblies from higher-order correlations in neural activity. Physiologically, we show that these assemblies exhibit properties consistent with Hebb's theory, including more reliable responses to repeated natural movie inputs than size-matched random ensembles and superior decoding of visual stimuli. Structurally, we find that neurons that participate in assemblies are significantly more integrated into the structural network than those that do not. Contrary to Hebb's original prediction, we do not observe a marked increase in the strength of monosynaptic excitatory connections between cells participating in the same assembly.

While these analyses often rely on phylogenetic trees, increasing evidence suggests that non-treelike evolutionary events, such as hybridization and horizontal gene transfer, are prevalent in the evolutionary histories of many species, and in such cases, tree-based models are insufficient. Phylogenetic networks can capture such complex evolutionary histories, but current methods for accurately inferring them lack scalability. For instance, state-of-the-art model-based approaches are limited to around 30 taxa. Implicit network inference methods like NeighborNet and Consensus Networks are fast but lack biological interpretability. Here, we introduce a novel method called InPhyNet that merges a set of non-overlapping, independently inferred networks into a unified topology, achieving linear scalability while maintaining high accuracy under the multispecies network coalescent model. Our simulations show that InPhyNet matches the accuracy of SNaQ on datasets with 30 taxa while drastically decreasing the overall network inference time. InPhyNet is also more accurate than implicit network methods on large datasets while maintaining computational feasibility. Re-analyzing a phylogeny of 1,158 land plants with InPhyNet, we recover known reticulate events and provide evidence for the controversial placement of Order Gnetales within gymnosperms.

In contrast, somatic cancer research - long dominated by the Somatic Mutation Theory - has stagnated due to fragmented, mutation-centric approaches that lack a unifying conceptual framework and have yielded only limited clinical progress3. GCC research identifies non-somatic human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) as the cells of origin for GCCs1,4. In somatic cancers, although the cancer stem cell theory is gaining acceptance, cancer stem cells are assumed to be of somatic origin, with their exact identity undefined5. Accumulating experimental evidence and clinical observations challenge the traditional separation between GCCs and somatic cancers, including malignant somatic transformation (MST) - the emergence of somatic cancer phenotypes from GCCs, often without new mutations2, 6-8 - suggesting that hPGCs may also initiate somatic cancers. However, no experimental model of MST has been established9. Merkel cell polyomavirus-positive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a highly aggressive somatic cancer with paradoxically stable genomes resembling those of GCCs10-12, offers a unique model to test germ cell theory-based somatic oncogenesis.

However, the cellular resolution is lost and only a complex linear combination of signals from multiple cells is observed. Thus, gene expression changes cannot be attributed to individual cells or cell populations. Cell-type deconvolution methods infer cellular compositions from bulk transcriptomics data. State-of-the-art approaches use single-cell data to build molecular reference profiles and identify powerful cell-type markers for improved deconvolution. In this context, we propose Dynamic celltype deconvolution ensembles for Mapping in mixed Conditions (DynaMiCs) for the integration of single-cell and bulk transcriptomics data. Specifically, DynaMiCs dynamically extracts information from single-cell experiments to (1) provide more accurate estimates of cellular compositions, and (2) establish a mapping between bulk and single-cell data. Consequently, DynaMiCs enables the investigation of how cell populations change in both quantity and molecular characteristics between different phenotypes, informed by single-cell experiments.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

While the structures and sequence preferences of DBDs have been extensively characterized, the role of IDR-mediated interactions in chromatin binding and nuclear organization remains poorly understood, in part because these interactions have been difficult to measure in living cells. Here, we use a recently developed single-molecule technique, proximity-assisted photoactivation (PAPA), to investigate how IDRs influence TF associations with each other and with chromatin, focusing on the factors Sp1 and Klf1. We find that the number and patterning of aromatic and basic residues within IDRs govern both TF self-association and chromatin binding. Remarkably, the isolated DBD of Sp1 binds chromatin weakly and non-specifically. By contrast, the isolated IDR interacts transiently with chromatin-bound full-length Sp1, and these interactions become more stable when even minimal DNA-binding capacity is restored. Replacing Sp1s native DBD with domains from heterologous TFs with differing sequence preferences--or even with nonspecific bacterial DBDs--preserves IDR-mediated interactions and chromatin association. PAPA measurements also reveal extensive heterotypic interactions between Sp1 and other TFs. Together, these results establish PAPA as a powerful method for studying IDR interactions in their native context and suggest that IDRs participate in widespread cooperative associations scaffolded around chromatin. In contrast to classical models, we propose that TF specificity in vivo emerges from ensembles of weak, dynamic, and diverse interactions--not from the intrinsic sequence preferences of DBDs alone.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Triad-LMF consolidates multi-omics datasets, mitigating feature dimension disparities through optimized preprocessing. To enable efficient multimodal information integration, Triad-LMF implements a two-stage hierarchical fusion strategy, where in Local Pairwise Fusion and Global Triadic Fusion are combined via the Two-Feature and Three-way LMF modules, facilitating a progressive transition from local modality interactions to global feature integration.

Here, we used long-read direct RNAsequencing to map transcript isoform changes in mouse ovaries across reproductive age. Comparing young and aged mice after controlled gonadotropin stimulation, we identified widespread alternative splicing changes, including shifts in exon usage, splice site selection, and transcript boundaries. Aged ovaries exhibited increased isoform diversity, favoring distal start and end sites, and a significant rise in exon skipping and intron retention events. Many of these age-biased splicing events altered open reading frames, introduced premature stop codons, or disrupted conserved protein domains. Notably, mitochondrial genes were disproportionately affected. We highlight Ndufs4, a mitochondrial Complex I subunit, as a case in which aging promotes the alternative splicing of a truncated isoform lacking the canonical Pfam domain. Structural modeling suggests this splice variant could impair Complex I function, resulting in increased ROS production. Our data suggest a mechanistic link between splicing and mitochondrial dysfunction in the aging ovary. These findings support the model of the splicing-energy-aging axis in ovarian physiology, wherein declining mitochondrial function and adaptive or maladaptive splicing changes are intertwined. Our study reveals that alternative splicing is not merely a byproduct of aging but a dynamic, transcriptome-wide regulatory layer that may influence ovarian longevity.

Native to the western Palearctic region, it has become established in every continent where its host plants (Pinus spp.) occur.

As a repeat invader with a wealth of information on various aspects relevant for biological invasions, it is highly suitable as a model organism for studying the role of international trade, the planting of non-native trees, and the potential occurrence of bridgehead invasions (where abundant non-native populations precipitate further invasions). In the present study, our specific objectives were to reconstruct the worldwide invasions of H. ligniperda and the pathways involved by using a multi-pronged approach including population genetics, analysis of historic interception data generated from inspections of imports, and records of establishments in the literature. Our review of the native and non-native ranges of H. ligniperda and the chronology of establishments revealed at least 13 separate invasions of non-native regions, beginning with Madeira (Portugal) before 1850, and, most recently, eastern China in 2019. We compared the population genetics of 464 specimens from eight countries in the native range and eight countries in the non-native range. Sequencing of the mitochondrial COI gene revealed the presence of 29 haplotypes in six well-supported clades, based on a Bayesian analysis. Non-native populations had significantly lower haplotype diversity (mean h = 0.219) than populations in the native range (mean h = 0.691). Countries in the non-native range had an average of about two haplotypes compared with about four haplotypes in native countries. In the non-native range, only one or two haplotypes were dominant, and these differed among invaded regions except for haplotype HL-H3 which occurred in Australia, New Zealand and China as well as in four countries in southern Europe, and HL-H4 which was dominant in New Zealand, California, New York State, and eastern China as well as two countries in southern Europe. Analyses of interceptions of H. ligniperda with imports arriving in five countries revealed that between 74% and 99% of interceptions originated from other non-native regions while in the USA, most interceptions were linked to imports from the native range beginning in the 1970s. Based on the combined evidence of the chronology of invasions, interception data, and analysis of haplotype distribution, we conclude that the early invasions (before 1950) probably all originated from the native range, while several of the more recent invasions probably originated from parts of the non-native range (suggestive of a bridgehead effect).

One-third of plots failed to regenerate (< 1750 conifer seedlings/ha) at levels adequate to produce closed-crown forest, whereas one-fifth experienced compositional changes, mainly towards jack pine (JP; Pinus banksiana) dominance. Pre-fire basal area of BS and living Sphagnum ground cover increased BS post-fire regeneration, whereas high-severity crown fires and spring fires reduced it. These findings suggest that mature BS-dominated forests may lose resilience in response to high-severity and spring fires. Given the projected increase in fire severity, and the extension towards an early-fire season in response to climate change, our study suggests that post-fire regeneration failure may become more frequent over the coming decades, with potential negative consequences on ecosystem services that are provided by BS-dominated boreal forests.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "The ability to observe the genomes of past human populations using ancient DNA provides an extraordinary perspective on many fundamental questions in human genetics, including understanding the evolutionary history of variants that underlie human disease and other phenotypes. However, ancient DNA is often damaged and degraded, yielding low-coverage of most nucleotides. Further, many publicly available genotypes for ancient humans are limited to ~1.23 million specific loci. Thus, variants of interest often fall outside these specific positions, limiting the ability of ancient DNA to shed light on many loci. Here, we address this challenge by quantifying linkage disequilibrium (LD) between modern variants and ancient genotyped variants (AGVs) to generate a catalog enabling rapid identification of proxy variants. We identified 260,732,675 pairs of AGVs and modern variants with a minimum LD threshold hold of R squared >= 0.2. Even at R squared >= 0.9, >= 60% of common variants were linked to an AGV in non-African ancestry groups, as were 34% of common variants in Africans. We evaluated the accuracy of the genotypes inferred from proxy variants in two high-coverage ancient genomes finding that > 90% of genotypes were correctly predicted, even in a 45,000 year old individual. We also find that AGVs are significantly older than expected and that many likely are evolving neutrally. We integrate these results in a database that researchers can easily query to identify ancient proxy variants if their variant of interest is not directly genotyped in ancient humans.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

M.; Meliza, C. D.", "abstract": "Postnatal experience is critical to auditory development in vertebrates. The zebra finch (Taeniopygia castanotis) provides a valuable model for understanding how complex social-acoustical environments influence development of the neural circuits that support perception of vocal communication signals. We previously showed that zebra finches raised in the rich acoustical environment of a breeding colony (colony-reared, CR) perform twice as well in an operant discrimination task as birds raised with only their families (pair-reared, PR), and we identified deficits in functional properties within the auditory pallium of PR birds that could explain this behavioral difference. Here, using single-unit extracellular recordings from the L3 subdivision of field L and caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) at three developmental timepoints (18--20, 30--35, and 90--110 days post hatch), we tracked how experience affects the emergence of these functional properties. Whereas CR birds showed stable single-unit response properties from fledging to adulthood alongside improvements in population-level encoding, PR birds exhibited progressive deterioration in neural function. Deficits in PR birds began emerging at 18 days for population metrics and by 30 days for single-unit properties, worsening into adulthood. These included altered spike waveforms, firing rates, selectivity, discriminability, coding efficiency, and noise invariance. Notably, these deficits occurred despite PR birds receiving normal exposure to the song of a male tutor, suggesting that learning to sing is robust enough to compensate for impaired auditory processing. Our findings demonstrate that a complex acoustical environment is necessary for both maintenance and development of the cortical-level auditory circuits that decode conspecific vocalizations.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we combined structural similarity searches, phylogenetics and population genomics with experimental assays of SAMD9/9L functions to resolve the evolutionary and functional dynamics of these immune proteins, spanning from prokaryotes to primates. We discovered structural analogs of SAMD9/9L in the anti-bacteriophage defense system Avs, resulting from convergent evolution. Further, the predicted nuclease active site was conserved in bacterial analogs and was essential for cell death functions, suggesting a fundamental role in defense across different life kingdoms. Despite this ancestral immunity, we identified genomic signatures of evolutionary arms-races in mammals, with remarkable gene copy number variations targeted by natural selection. We further unveiled that the absence of SAMD9 in bonobos corresponds to a recent gene loss still segregating in the population. Finally, we found that chimp and bonobo SAMD9Ls have enhanced anti-HIV-1 functions, and that bonobo-specific SAMD9L polymorphisms confer increased anti-HIV-1 activity to human SAMD9L without compromising its effect on cell translation. These SAMD9/9L adaptations likely resulted from strong viral selective pressures, including by primate lentiviruses, and could contribute to lentiviral resistance in bonobos. Altogether, this study elucidates the interplay between ancient immune convergence across kingdoms and species-specific adaptations within the Avs9 and SAMD9/9L antiviral shared immunity.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Further, the drivers of such changes are uncertain, and quantitative models of the respective contribution of different African regions are lacking. Here we provide a complete reconstruction of the meta-population dynamics over the last 200,000 years by quantitatively integrating an environmental niche model based on archaeological sites within a spatially explicit population genetic framework.

Ancestral state inference tools that account for trait-dependent properties are limited, because of challenges associated with inferring past states in a manner consistent with a phylogenetic tree (and its uncertainty) and with a stochastic process describing how states change over time. In phylogeography, ancestral state inference is used to reconstruct the past locations of viruses, bacteria or other rapidly-evolving organisms, characterizing, for example, how often and when a virus moved among locations, or from one host species to another. However, such reconstructions are sensitive to differences in sampling among different locations or host species, and this can bias the reconstruction of the location of ancestors towards the more widely sampled region/species. Here, we introduce a new method, Sampling Aware Ancestral State Inference (SAASI), which builds on recent advances in state-dependent diversification models and reconstructs ancestral states, and in particular for phylogeographic applications, accounting for sampling differences. Indeed, we find that accounting for sampling changes the inferred historical location of viral lineages and the times of key viral movements. We use simulations to show that with known sampling differences, SAASI infers past viral locations considerably more accurately than standard methods. We apply our method to the spread of the H5N1 virus in the United States in 2024, and explore how robust phylogeographic reconstruction is to differences in sampling and epidemiological rates between wild bird populations, cattle, humans and other species. We find that the key transmission event from wild birds to cattle is estimated to occur later under lower sampling in wild birds (compared to other species) than when sampling is not accounted for. SAASI is rapid and readily scales to trees with 100,000 tips, making it feasible for modern phylogeographic applications.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

We discovered that the induction of lysosomal lipid signaling and lysosomal AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), or the reduction of lysosomal mechanistic-target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, increases the expression of histone H3.3 variant and elevates H3K79 methylation, leading to lifespan extension across multiple generations. This transgenerational pro-longevity effect requires intestine-to-germline transportation of H3.3 and a germline-specific H3K79 methyltransferase, and can be recapitulated by overexpressing H3.3 or the H3K79 methyltransferase.

Breeding for resistant varieties relies on the introgression of partial resistance factors from wild grapes, but virulent strains are rapidly emerging. To decipher the genetic bases of the adaptation to plant resistance in P. viticola, we carried out a QTL mapping study using two F1 populations segregating for the ability to overcome Rpv3.1, Rpv10 and Rpv12. Trajectories of virulence emergence were also compared by conducting a population structure analysis on a panel of diversity. We confirmed the position of AvrRpv3.1 and identified the AvrRpv12 locus, in which strains overcoming Rpv12 presented large deletions encompassing several RXLR genes. Distinct virulent alleles were selected independently in different winegrowing regions. Unlike this standard case of recessive virulence, partial breakdown of Rpv10 was determined by a dominant locus, suggesting a suppressor activity. The virulent haplotype exhibits structural rearrangements and an extended effector repertoire. It corresponds to an admixed genomic segment likely originating from a secondary introduction of P. viticola into Europe.

In a large cohort of patients (n=38) with hippocampal damage due to autoimmune limbic encephalitis, we had reported evidence that extra-hippocampal structural and functional abnormalities in the broader hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network fully mediated the effects of hippocampal damage on several aspects of episodic memory. However, we had not examined the specific diencephalic nuclei affected or the white matter pathways that would help explain these remote effects. In this study, we used recently developed methods of automated segmentation of diencephalic nuclei, as well as a range of analyses of white matter integrity. As expected, we found atrophy in the anterior thalamic nuclei and in the mammillary bodies, but also in the laterodorsal, pulvinar, and dorsomedial nuclei. The extent of atrophy in some of these nuclei was comparable to, if not larger than that observed for the hippocampal formation, even though none of our patients' acute clinical scans disclosed thalamic damage. We also present evidence linking these volumes to patients' episodic memory impairment over and above any correlation with hippocampal/subicular subfield volumes. White matter integrity was strongly compromised in the hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network, and the volumetric relationship between the hippocampal formation and the mammillary bodies was at least partly mediated by the integrity of the fornix across patients, consistent with the assumption of Wallerian degeneration following focal medial temporal lobe damage. However, evidence for the specialisation of the hippocampal-diencephalic-cingulate network in recollection/recall was mixed, and white matter abnormalities extended to regions well beyond this network.

A central question is whether attention operates by enhancing all features of a selected target, or by optimizing neural encoding around the specific demands of the task--i.e., is selective attention fundamentally anchored around task targets or around task goals? Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) while participants performed two speech tasks--comprehension and detection--on identical auditory stimuli. Task difficulty was manipulated by introducing controlled background noise that increased cognitive demands without reducing speech intelligibility. We developed a novel EEG-based method, the Modulation Response Function (MRF), which captures cortical sensitivity to spectro-temporal features via spectrogram reconstruction. Behaviorally, comprehension performance declined with increased difficulty, with greater reliance on semantic cues, while detection performance remained near ceiling. Neurally, both envelope tracking and MRF magnitude were higher during comprehension, reflecting greater cognitive engagement. Critically, spectro-temporal tuning differed across tasks: formant-related modulations were selectively enhanced during comprehension, whereas pitch-related modulations were emphasized during detection. These findings support a discriminative model of attention, where cortical encoding is flexibly reshaped according to cognitive goals, selectively amplifying the features most relevant for successful task performance.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Using a cross-validation procedure that identifies shared structure across individuals, we find that two components successfully generalize across participants, together accounting for about 32% of the explainable variance in brain responses to sentences. The first component corresponds to processing difficulty, and the second--to meaning abstractness; we formally support this interpretation through targeted behavioral experiments and information-theoretic measures. Furthermore, we find that the two components are systematically organized within frontal and temporal language areas, with the meaning-abstractness component more prominent in the temporal regions.

According to the standing model of cortical development, Direct Neurogenesis predominates at early stages of development, and progressively shifts to Indirect Neurogenesis, which predominates at late stages. However, neurogenesis at early stages should be compatible with RGC amplification, and neurogenesis at late stages needs to involve RGC consumption, which seems in conflict with the standing model. Here we studied the modes of neurogenesis along cortical development using multiple approaches, including birthdating, live imaging and MADM clone labeling. Contrary to the established dogma, our data show that Indirect Neurogenesis clearly predominates at early developmental stages, gradually shifting to Direct Neurogenesis at late stages.

Monocular deprivation (MD) in adult mice alters cortical responses, though more slowly and differently than during a critical period in early life. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging in awake adult mice to dissect the roles of VIP and GABA release from VIP interneurons during adult MD and subsequent binocular recovery. We found comparable level of ocular dominance shifts after MD in mice deficient in either peptidergic or GABA signaling, but disrupting GABA signaling impaired recovery of binocular responses. We also showed that running preferentially enhances contralateral eye responses in binocular primary visual cortex. However, this eye-specific modulation of visual responses by running was altered during recovery from MD and was dependent on VIP signaling pathways.

These results suggest that long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-based RNAi is not appropriate for gene silencing in Mollusks as well as other members of the broader Lophotrochozoan clade. The study also finds an abundance of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in both soma and gonads. Differences are also found in piRNA biology. Many invertebrates exhibit somatic piRNAs; however, mollusk piRNAs appear to be restricted to a subset of cells, limiting the potential of piRNA-based RNAi. Further, individual animals also express a unique collection of piRNAs that seem to be only partially determined through inheritance from both parents. Together this work defines the RNAi mechanisms in mollusks, which represent 23% of animals, and provides insights into the phenotypic diversity seen in this group.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "One of the longstanding debates in evolutionary biology is the effect of fluctuating selection on genetic changes in populations. However, the extent to which these periodic forces influence organisms at both genomic and phenotypic levels remains unclear. Furthermore, despite the compelling evidence of fluctuating selection from recent studies, there is a disconnect between empirical findings and theoretical models concerning the underlying mechanisms due to the limited evidence regarding the scale and processes that generate stable genome-wide oscillations. This study aims to elucidate the genetic and ecological factors driving fluctuating selection and to identify the parameters that produce consistent oscillatory patterns in allele frequencies. To address these longstanding challenges, we developed a modeling framework integrating quantitative and population genetics to simulate a population under various selection regimes. Using SLiM, a forward evolution simulator, we varied genetic (heritability and genomic architecture) and ecological (selection pressure and season length) parameters. Unlike previous models focusing on selection acting directly on loci, our approach evaluates individual fitness based on the shift in the seasonal optimum relative to the mean phenotype. We also applied spectral analysis to detect periodicity, indicating cyclical selective environments. Our simulations shed light on conditions sustaining oscillations in allele frequencies over time. Spectral analysis successfully identifies the periodic patterns from allele frequency, even under highly complex selection regimes. Not only does our study clarify the conditions that yield persistent oscillatory behaviors, but these parameters are also relatively easy to predict from natural population, providing a possibility of empirically testing these models.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Insecticide regulation relies on the assumption that model bee species adequately represent responses to exposure across the diversity of insect taxa, despite over 479 million years of evolutionary divergence and a limited understanding of how exposure effects vary across insect orders. Here, using comparative whole-brain transcriptomics, we show differences in molecular responses to modern insecticides across evolutionary distant pollinator lineages: butterflies, flies, and bees. Within each of the four species studied, different insecticides (sulfoxaflor and clothianidin) triggered broadly similar gene regulatory responses. In surprising contrast, exposure impacts differed sharply among species, with no genes or pathways being consistently affected. Strikingly, we found that sulfoxaflor, approved based on its supposed safety for bees, causes more disruptions in non-bee pollinators than the restricted neonicotinoid clothianidin, revealing a critical blind spot in current assessment protocols. Our findings demonstrate that over large evolutionary timescales, species-level differences can outweigh variations in insecticide chemical structures in shaping the effects of insecticide exposure. These interspecific differences likely reflect distinct physiological and metabolic traits shaped over tens to hundreds of millions of years. Together, our findings highlight the urgent need to reevaluate insecticide safety assessments to incorporate phylogenetic diversity, potentially explaining why regulatory efforts have failed to halt pollinator declines despite stricter testing requirements.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

C.; Hawkes, K.; Kim, P.", "abstract": "Humans are distinguished from our closest living relatives, other great apes, by our extended postmenopausal longevity, later first births, and shorter birth intervals. Those features likely evolved as ancestral grandmothers' foraging subsidised dependents in habitats lacking foods that youngsters could manage for themselves. If so, as female post-fertile years increased, older years increased in males too. Those still-fertile old males in the paternity competition pushed average male reproductive success below the female average. According to R. A. Fisher, Mendelian inheritance requires equal contributions from both sexes to descendant gene pools. Higher average reproductive success in one sex makes tendencies to overproduce it pass to more grandchildren, equalizing averages in descendant generations. Yet, men's lower average reproductive success persists, their fertility lasting decades longer than women's. Here, we present a simple mathematical model to investigate this phenomenon. We show that a male-biased adult sex ratio is consistent with a offspring sex ratio of 1:1. Assuming a stable age distribution, we show that if male fertile careers are twice as long as those of females, the corresponding reproductive value of males is larger than that of females, which acts to balance the effect of higher female reproductive success. We propose that extended male fertility balances the sex difference in average reproductive success, maintaining Fisher's equilibrium under human life history conditions.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

The latter are often the first, most powerful mating barriers to evolve during speciation, but understanding their genetics is hampered by the context-dependence of mate choice. We circumvented this challenge by using allele-specific expression analyses in F1 hybrids of sexually isolated cricket species, Teleogryllus oceanicus and T. commodus. Female crickets choose mating partners based on species-specific male advertisement songs, and we found extensive cis-regulatory divergence in neural tissues exposed to conspecific, heterospecific, or mixed-species songs. Genes with divergent expression were implicated in learning, memory and transcriptional regulation, and they showed elevated population genetic differentiation in allopatry but not sympatry. This implies that genes recruited during evolutionary divergence of mate recognition systems may be homogenised by gene flow. Regulatory divergence was asymmetrical between the two species; divergent selection on genes associated with female perception of male song was more prominent in T. oceanicus than in T. commodus. Evolved differences in gene regulation are strongly associated with sexual signal perception in closely related species, supporting the idea that rapid cis-regulatory evolution of mate recognition can accelerate speciation.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Using low-coverage whole genome sequencing of Callithrix species, we investigated Callithrix evolutionary history, species genetic diversity, and the genomic basis of derived small body size and exudivory. Our phylogenetic species tree shows that Callithrix likely originated in southeastern Brazil and migrated northward to the semi-arid regions of central and northeastern Brazil. We show that there is greater genetic similarity between smaller and more exudivorous Callithrix species relative to larger and less exudivorous species, and that the genus likely experienced extensive past reticulation. Based on these results, we argue that the Callithrix migration from the Atlantic Forest biome to the relatively more extreme environments of Cerrado/Caatinga biomes progressively reduced body size and increased exudivory specialization in Callithrix marmosets. We also identified species-specific candidate genes under putative positive selection for traits that include body growth, bone development, reproduction, fat metabolism, insulin signaling, and liporegulation. In conclusion, we increased genomic resources for understudied Callithrix species, while providing the most comprehensive overview of marmoset genomic diversity to-date, and identify several candidate genes under positive selection for traits related to small body size and exudivory.

To contribute to this understanding, here we use the interactions between Paraburkholderia endosymbionts and their Dictyostelid social amoeba hosts as a model system to investigate the role of dispersal, a fundamental ecological process, in shaping the distribution and evolution of endosymbiotic interactions. We first found that patterns of endosymbiont diversification were highly biogeographic, suggesting a significant degree of dispersal limitation. We then experimentally mediated the dispersal of several endosymbiont species into environments with multiple host species and found that each symbiont was able to sustain a high prevalence in each host population. The benefit/detriment of these mediated interactions did not change with increasing phylogenetic distance from what is suspected to be the focal amoeba host species in nature. Taken together, our findings suggest Paraburkholderia endosymbionts are generally pre-adapted to occupy a variety of Dictyostelid host environments, and their distribution among host populations is subject to a high degree of dispersal limitation.

While bacteria can utilize L-threonate as a sole carbon source by converting it to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, a glycolysis intermediate, through a three- or four-step metabolic pathway, the corresponding processes in plants remain uncharacterized. Remarkably, an Arabidopsis gene encodes a unique protein containing domains homologous to all three enzymes involved in the bacterial three-step pathway. We designated this protein as L-threonate metabolizing domains (LTD) and investigated its functional role in plant L-threonate metabolism. Despite extensive efforts, recombinant expression of LTD was unsuccessful, likely due to its large protein size. Therefore, a reverse genetic approach was employed, using ltd knockout Arabidopsis lines to explore LTD function. Under continuous dark conditions, where ascorbate degradation is facilitated, LTD transcription was significantly upregulated, leading to increased L-threonate dehydrogenase (LtnD) activity. Knockout lines of LTD exhibited no detectable LtnD activity under both light and dark conditions, alongside elevated levels of L-threonate compared to wild-type plants. These results indicate that LTD is essential for L-threonate metabolism in Arabidopsis. The LTD gene is highly conserved among land plants but is absent in green algae, providing a hypothesis that the rise in ascorbate concentrations during plant evolution necessitated a more active metabolism of ascorbate degradation products.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

A key aspect of this response is the release of heat shock factors (Hsfs) from Hsp70-mediated attenuation under heat-shock conditions, making Hsp70 a central regulator of HSR. However, the role of Hsp70 co-chaperones in this process remains largely unexplored in plants. Our study identifies AtDjB3, a heat-inducible class II J-domain protein (JDP), as a critical modulator of HSR. We present microscopy and cell fractionation-based evidence to demonstrate that the loss of AtDjB3 impairs Hsc70-1 recruitment to heat-induced protein aggregates, thereby maintaining HsfA1d bound to Hsc70-1 in the cytoplasm. This inhibited the expression of many heat-inducible genes, including HSP70s, HSP90, HSP18.2, FES1A, HSFA2, and HSFA7A. Consistent with this, AtDJB3 mutants displayed compromised thermotolerance, as evidenced by their inability to survive a prolonged heat stress of 37{degrees}C. Conversely, overexpression of AtDJB3 conferred enhanced thermotolerance, further supporting its positive regulatory role in the HSR. We propose that AtDjB3 not only contributes to the solubilization of heat-induced protein aggregates but also promotes Hsf activation by diverting Hsc70-1 to these aggregates, thereby releasing Hsfs to drive the transcriptional heat shock response.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase (LRR-RK) MIK2 is an exceptionally versatile receptor involved in the perception of the vast family of Brassicales-specific endogenous SCOOP peptides as well as potential MAMPs derived from Fusarium and related fungi.

We identified a MIK2-clade protein from tomato, which shares properties of AtMIK2 in the perception of the Fusarium elicitor but not of SCOOP peptides.

Loss of m6A modification enhances resilience to heat stress by increasing transcript levels of heat-responsive genes and stabilizing their mRNAs. Upon heat shock, plants transiently reduce m6A levels by modulating key methylation machinery genes. This m6A deficiency enriches the H3K4me3 histone mark at heat-responsive gene loci, boosting their transcription. The combined effect of m6A-regulated chromatin changes and mRNA stability facilitates the accumulation of heat shock proteins essential for cellular protection and stress response.

Recent studies on TM homeostasis (thylakostasis) have highlighted the essential role of the TM remodeling protein VIPP1 (Vesicle Inducing Protein in Plastids 1). As a member of the ESCRT-III/PspA/VIPP1 superfamily, VIPP1 forms large ring- and filament-like homo-oligomeric structures that exhibit a membrane remodeling activity. The oligomerization status was proposed to be modulated by the intrinsically disordered C-terminal tail (Vc), whereas its functional role remained unclear. Notably, this Vc region is conserved not only in photosynthetic VIPP1 but also in the PspA proteins of extremophilic species, implicating its role in membrane stress responses. To investigate the role of the Vc region in VIPP1 assembly, we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays in Arabidopsis chloroplasts and identified chloroplast-localized HSP70 proteins as major interactors. Among the two isoforms, cpHsc70-1 was found to be specifically required for modulating VIPP1 oligomeric assembly and dynamics in response to heat stress. Genetic analyses revealed that cpHsc70-1 facilitates the disassembly of VIPP1 oligomers, similarly to Vps4 ATPase in ESCRT-III; loss of either the Vc region or cpHsc70-1 impaired VIPP1 disassembly, resulting in more static oligomeric structures. Furthermore, cpHsc70-1 exhibited a broader role in chloroplast proteostasis, as the cphsc70-1 mutant showed impaired accumulation of GFP-fusion proteins. Together, our findings uncover a crucial crosstalk between proteostasis and thylakostasis in chloroplasts, coordinated by cpHsc70-1 and VIPP1 in response to membrane stress.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Standard screening methods for HLB therapeutic treatments typically involve various laboratory-based assays to select treatments with antimicrobial properties3, which then advance to greenhouse and eventually field testing in a workflow that takes multiple years. Unlike traditional lab-first screening, we present a design of experiments framework, referred to as \"Grove-First\", that rapidly screens treatments with regulatory-friendly profiles in commercial citrus groves using trunk injection to select treatments that improve tree health and fruit yield over the course of a single growing season. Using this framework, we identified candidate treatments with effects comparable to or better than the standard oxytetracycline (OTC) on visual tree-health and/or yield indices in an initial screen of HLB-positive 8-year-old Valencia sweet orange trees. Expanded trials in commercial citrus groves allowed us to validate the initial screening results at other locations and in other citrus varieties. Grove-First rapidly accelerated the identification and large-scale field testing of HLB therapies, some of which are available for growers to use immediately and others that require further field testing and/or regulatory actions.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Lesion appearance traits reflecting specific interactions between particular host and pathogen genotypes were consistently associated with lesion growth, whereas overall effects of host genotype and environment were modest. Both host cultivar and cultivar-by-environment interaction effects on lesion growth were highly significant and moderately heritable (h2 [&ge;] 0.40).

Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB) caused by the phloem colonizing bacterial pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas) was suggested to be a pathogen triggered chronic immune disease.

Here, we show CLas triggers phloem cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and callose deposition in photosynthesis tissues, but little or none in non-photosynthesis tissues of citrus. We further demonstrate that CLas triggers ROS production in chloroplasts. Overexpression of flavodoxin (Fld), an electron shuttle, in chloroplasts reduced ROS production, cell death and HLB symptoms, but not phloem callose deposition induced by CLas. Knockout, silencing, and overexpression of phloem callose synthase genes CsCalS7a, CsCalS7b, or CsCalS7c demonstrated that phloem callose deposition also caused phloem cell death. Trunk injection with 2-deoxy-d-glucose, a callose deposition inhibitor, reduced fruit drop and increased fruit yield of HLB symptomatic trees in field trials. Using tomato-Ca.

With climate change intensifying drought and expanding disease incidence, it is critical to understand how combined abiotic and biotic stresses influence plant defense. We investigated the transcriptomic response of a susceptible soybean cultivar to ASR infection under normal and water-limited conditions at four infection stages (12, 24, 72, and 192 hours after-inoculation). We observed a biphasic expression of defense-related genes, particularly resistance gene analogs (RGAs), with an early peak at 12 hours and a late resurgence at 192 hours. Combined stress induced a greater number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) than rust alone, especially at early infection. Among the differentially expressed RGAs (RGADEs), over 64% belonged to the TM-LRR class, and NBS-LRR genes were the most enriched at known ASR resistance loci, particularly Rpp2. Water limitation strongly modulated gene expression at late stages, revealing stress-specific transcriptional reprogramming.

Regulatory mechanisms of light harvesting and alternative electron pathways are critical in dissipating and distributing energy under fluctuating light intensities (FL), but less is known about downstream metabolic regulations. Here, we compared the cellular responses of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii grown under FL to cells acclimated to constant high (HL) or low light (LL), either under high (2 %) or low (0.04 %) CO2. Under low CO2, the physiology of FL cells resembled HL cells and proteomics revealed an induction of the ATP consuming carbon-concentrating mechanism, and photorespiration particularly under FL. High CO2 promoted growth under FL, albeit by a lesser extent than under HL and led to higher ATP contents than under low CO2. To fuel ATP production under low CO2, cells upregulated mitochondrial respiration under FL, while enhanced cyclic electron flow and redox shuttling between intracellular compartments was most evident under FL and LL. Chloroplastic carbon metabolism rapidly responded to light changes, independent of CO2 availability, whereas metabolites associated with mitochondrial bioenergetics responded slower, and remained abundant under high CO2. The accumulation of enzymes involved in starch synthesis and breakdown under FL, together with the transient accumulation of hexoses and hexose phosphates, indicated that cells relied on sugars as a transient carbon pool to meet changing metabolic demands under FL. We conclude that the interplay between light intensity and CO2 availability drives critical energy trade-offs, balancing photoprotection, repair, and carbon allocation, that regulate growth under FL.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Hard red spring (HRS) wheat is an important wheat class in the US and is primarily grown in the Northern Great Plains. Despite a long history of breeding efforts in this region, long-term quantification of genetic gains for key traits has remained limited. This study analyzes over sixty years of data from the USDA-coordinated Hard Red Spring Wheat Uniform Regional Nursery (HRSWURN) to evaluate genetic advancements in agronomic traits across multiple phases. A significant positive genetic gain of 0.61% per annum was observed for grain yield in HRS wheat released in the Northern US region, which is lower than the expected gains needed to meet future wheat demand. The change was 0.07% for test weight, -0.04% for days to heading, and -0.16% for plant height. Notably, sustained yield improvements have not affected grain protein levels since they were first measured in 1995, indicating that ongoing selection has effectively balanced grain yield and protein despite their negative correlation (r = -0.31). Assessment of genetic gains over 20-year phases suggested slowing rates of genetic gains for grain yield but did not indicate any plateaus. The realized genetic gains were generally higher for individual breeding programs when breeding for target environments, with the public breeding program in Minnesota observing gains of approximately 1% per annum.

Despite extensive studies for more than 20 years, the structure, substrate recognition and transport mechanism of DUR3 have remained unknown.

ZmDUR3 adopts an amino acid-polyamine-organocation (APC) superfamily fold and is structurally distinct from animal facilitative urea transporters. Our structure provides important insights into urea recognition by DUR3 and suggests that a pair of acidic residues is potentially involved in proton coupling during urea transport.

Stomatal density (SD) is a tractable model system for exploring how high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) data could be exploited by a new spatial analysis approach to better understand a developmentally and functionally important trait. SD is a composite trait, resulting from various components related to cell identity and size, which are themselves governed by a series of spatio-developmental processes. Data from 180 recombinant inbred lines of maize (Zea mays (L.)) were analyzed by a new Stomatal Patterning Phenotype (SPP) to: (1) describe the average spatial probability distribution of the nearest neighboring stomata; (2) derive a core set of component traits related to cell size, cell packing and positional probabilities; (3) build a structural equation model of component traits underlying SD; and (4) identify stomatal patterning quantitative trait loci (QTL). The core set of SPP-derived traits explained 74% of the variation in SD. Analyzing SPP component traits allowed some loci previously identified as generic SD QTL to be recognized as specific to lateral versus longitudinal elements of stomatal patterning.

Plants were cultivated under controlled glasshouse conditions with two water treatments: ponded (PW) and limited water (LW) maintained at 60-65% field capacity throughout the vegetative stage. Under LW, plants exhibited decreased photosynthetic efficiency, stomatal conductance, and stomatal density but increased cuticular and epicuticular wax (CEW) deposition, which helped conserve water. The rice cultivar Sherpa exhibited reduced sensitivity to regulation of gas exchange, stomatal adjustments and photosynthetic efficiency, and the greatest CEW deposition among the japonica varieties, indicating potential for improved WUE. Thousand grain weight showed no significant differences between the two water treatments. Brown rice yield and milling recovery were also unaffected. Spectral analysis of dehulled seeds suggested that LW stress increased protein content but had no effect on lipids and starch.

Therefore, we turned to gene editing as a tool to address these problems. We utilized two CRISPR systems (Cas9 and Cas12a) and two papaya genes, CpPDS (phytoene desaturase) and CpMLO6 (Mildew Locus O 6), to establish efficient genome editing systems of papaya. The systems were delivered by an optimized protocol of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (AMT) of embryogenic callus suspension cultures derived from hypocotyls. Accordingly, we transformed papaya with five plasmid constructs, each of which expressed one or two guide RNAs (gRNAs) for gene editing using either Cas9 or Cas12a. All except two T0 transgenic plants tested produced mutations with the majority containing indels of over 90%. Furthermore, successful mutation of the CpPDS gene using both Cas9 and Cas12a produced albino phenotypes as expected for disrupting a gene for carotenoid biosynthesis. Successful mutagenesis was achieved with seven out of eight gRNAs. Homozygous and/or biallelic mutants were generated from transformation using all five constructs, suggesting the feasibility of obtaining transgene-free homozygous segregating mutants by selfing in the second generation.

Here, we introduce GraphKcat, a deep learning framework that integrates enzyme-substrate 3D binding conformations for precise kinetic parameter prediction. The method employs Chai-1 to generate enzyme-substrate complex conformations, followed by a developed multi-scale hierarchical graph neural network to systematically characterize active site features from all-atom (AA) level to coarse-grained (CG) level, which are subsequently fused with LLMs embedded substrate, sequence, and environmental related information for prediction.

However, a critical but often overlooked challenge is the presence of error in empirical datasets, including sequencing errors, misalignments, and inaccuracies in gene tree estimation. This issue is particularly pressing in the context of phylogenetic networks, which can contain an arbitrary number of parameters and are thus highly susceptible to overfitting. Errors in the input data can lead to artificially inflated network complexity, misrepresenting evolutionary history with non-biological reticulations. In this study, we systematically examine how different sources of data error influence network inference and show that many widely used methods are vulnerable to these distortions. We find that inaccuracies in gene tree estimation and sequence alignment degrade the reliability of inferred networks. These issues are exacerbated when the number of reticulations that an algorithm can infer exceeds the true number of reticulations in the phylogenetic network. Our analysis underscores the importance of accounting for data error when applying network inference methods and provides practical recommendations for minimizing its impact.

{"title": "Maximum Entropy in the Gaussian Network Model: A Thermodynamic Reference State for Protein Dynamics", "doi": "10.1101/2025.05.18.654696", "authors": "Erman, B.", "abstract": "This paper presents a rigorous proof that the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) with uniform spring constants maximizes entropy subject only to constraints imposed by the native contact topology. We demonstrate that this entropic optimality establishes the GNM as a fundamental thermodynamic reference state for protein dynamics, rather than merely a computational convenience. Our analysis shows that proteins, as soft matter systems, are predominantly governed by entropic considerations, with thermal fluctuations distributed among their degrees of freedom in a manner that maximizes configurational entropy. The uniform-spring constant GNM provides the least biased representation of protein dynamics, explaining its remarkable success in predicting experimental observables including NMR-measured correlations. We discuss how applying additional constraints to this maximum-entropy reference state, such as non-uniform spring constants or specific covariance requirements, inevitably reduces entropy while increasing Helmholtz free energy. This reference state framework offers new insights into allosteric mechanisms, drug binding effects, and the evolutionary balance between thermodynamic optimality and functional specialization in proteins. Previous approaches that constrained GNM fluctuations while maximizing entropy are contextualized within this theoretical foundation, highlighting pathways for model refinement while maintaining entropic principles.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

D.; Ali, M. Y.; Garcia Martin, J. M.; Zhao, X.; Sylvain, S.; Trybus, K. M.; Solmaz, S. R.", "abstract": "Nesprin-2 is a subunit of LINC complexes, which span the nuclear envelope and have key roles in mechanotransduction and nuclear positioning during brain and muscle development. Nesprin-2 interacts with the plus-end directed motor kinesin-1 and the dynein adapter Bicaudal D2 (BicD2), which in turn recruits the minus-end directed motor cytoplasmic dynein to position the nucleus during neuronal migration of postmitotic neurons, but the molecular details of these interactions are elusive. Here we present a structural model of a minimal Nesprin-2/BicD2 complex. A structure prediction with a PAE score in the high confidence range was obtained from AlphaFold and experimentally validated by mutagenesis, binding assays and biophysical studies. The core of the binding site is formed by spectrin repeats of Nesprin-2, which form an alpha-helical bundle with the cargo-binding domain of BicD2. The minimal Nesprin-2 fragment also interacts robustly with full-length BicD2. The BicD2-binding site is separated by a ~65 residue intrinsically disordered linker from the LEWD sequence motif that acts as kinesin-1 recruitment site, and we propose that both kinesin-1 and BicD2/dynein interact with Nesprin-2 simultaneously. We propose that structurally distinct interactions between BicD2 and its cargo adapters Nesprin-2, Nup358 and Rab6, as well as distinctions in the adjacent kinesin-1 recruiting sites could finetune overall motility for these transport pathways that have important roles in brain and muscle development. Mutations of Nesprin-2 and BicD2 cause devastating brain and muscle developmental diseases, including Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy and spinal muscular atrophy, and results may help devise therapies for these diseases.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Vagal ganglia are comprised of embryologically distinct nodose and jugular neurons, but little is known of their specific contribution to nociceptive reflexes. Using a novel TRPV1Flp mouse in combination with P2X2Cre, Tac1Cre, intersectional reporter mice and AAV we mapped and modulated distinct nociceptive afferents. TRPV1+P2X2+ neurons were found exclusively in the nodose ganglion and were activated by abmATP and capsaicin but rarely expressed Tac1. TRPV1+P2X2+ fibers innervated the lungs (many projected into the alveoli) but not the trachea. Centrally they innervated the nucleus tractus solitarius (nTS). >90% of TRPV1+Tac1+ neurons were found in the jugular ganglion and were activated by capsaicin but not abmATP. TRPV1+Tac1+ fibers innervated the lungs (although none projected into the alveoli) and the trachea submucosa. They terminated solely in the paratrigeminal complex (Pa5). Many TRPV1-Tac1+ neurons were found in both nodose and jugular ganglia that innervated the trachea and large pulmonary airways. These projected to both nTS and Pa5. Using intersectional chemogenetics we selectively stimulated lower airway afferent subsets using intravenous injections of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO). Activation of TRPV1+, TRPV1+P2X2+ or TRPV1+Tac1+ fibers evoked bradycardia and bradypnea. Activation of Tac1+ fibers evoked tachycardia and tachypnea. Activation of vagal TRPV1-Tac1+ neurons only evoked tachycardia.

To address this knowledge gap, we developed CAR T cells targeting B7-H3 in immune-competent osteosarcoma models and evaluated the intrinsic and extrinsic effects of deleting a potent negative regulator called Regnase-1 (Reg-1). Deletion of Reg-1 not only improved the effector function of B7-H3-CAR T cells but also endowed them with the ability to create a proinflammatory landscape characterized by an influx of IFN{gamma}-producing endogenous T cells and NK cells and a reduction of inhibitory myeloid cells, including M2 macrophages.

In this study, we identified hippuric acid, an aromatic gut microbe-derived metabolite, as a potent enhancer of pro-inflammatory responses using a murine bacterial infection model and a non-targeted liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics. Administering hippuric acid intraperitoneally in murine models of Escherichia coli infection or LPS-induced inflammation significantly heightened pro-inflammatory responses and innate immune cell activation. In vitro, hippuric acid selectively potentiated M1-like macrophage polarization (LPS + IFN{gamma}) but had no effect on M2-like polarization (IL-4). Hippuric acid further enhanced responses to diverse MyD88-dependent TLR ligands, but not TRIF-dependent TLR3, implicating a possible mechanism of action via activation of TLR-MyD88 signaling. Genetic deletion of MyD88 abrogated the pro-inflammatory effects of hippuric acid both in vitro and in vivo, confirming its dependence on the MyD88 pathway. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses revealed that hippuric acid promoted cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid accumulation, linking microbial metabolism to lipid-driven immune activation. Notably, hippuric acid similarly enhanced pro-inflammatory responses in human macrophages, and its elevated levels correlated with increased sepsis mortality, highlighting its potential clinical relevance.

Reverse electron transfer (RET), defined as the upstream flow of electrons from the quinone pool to complex I, is a major source of pathological reactive oxygen species (ROS) under stress conditions. Using an in vivo model of brain IR, we show that RET-supporting substrates (succinate and glycerol 3-phosphate) accumulate during oxygen deprivation. Rapid oxidation of these substrates by brain mitochondria upon reoxygenation drives massive ROS production, while also leading to over-reduction and dissociation of the complex I flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor. The resulting FMN-deficient complex I becomes catalytically impaired, unable to oxidize NADH or to produce ROS. To mitigate RET and preserve complex I function, we used transgenic mice xenotopically expressing alternative oxidase (AOX). This enzyme bypasses complexes III and IV by directly oxidizing the reduced quinone pool and passing electrons onto molecular oxygen. AOX expression did not alter complex I abundance, supercomplexes assembly, or basal respiration rates, but effectively diverted electrons from the quinone pool, decreasing RET flux via complex I and limiting ROS generation during IR. This attenuation of RET preserved complex I FMN binding, suppressed oxidative stress, and conferred neuroprotection in vivo. Our findings reveal a novel strategy for rewiring mitochondrial electron flux to mitigate initial IR brain injury, highlighting modulation of the quinone pool by AOX as a potential therapeutic strategy for IR.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

We found evidence of strong and variable selection, with particular genotypes favored more than five-fold in certain years and locations. Fecundity showed evidence of classical local adaptation, with accessions generally performing better close to their home. However, southern accessions usually had the highest fecundity---but were far more sensitive to harsh winters and slug herbivory, which strongly decreased both survival and fecundity. Accessions originally sampled on beaches had low fecundity in all environments, but massively outperformed all other accessions in the selection experiments, presumably due to an advantage during seedling establishment associated with their very large seeds.

Sequence-based methods are easier to apply to large-scale proteins since they do not rely on high-quantity structures.

In this study, we propose DPStab, a sequence-based deep learning solution that accurately predicts protein stability changes upon single residue mutations. DPStab transfers a protein large language model as a core component and incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to capture the contact changes around mutated positions for {Delta}{Delta}G and {Delta}Tm prediction. To address data imbalance and the antisymmetric nature of mutation effects, DPStab employs a self-distillation inference strategy under the supervision of an antisymmetric constraint. Benchmarking demonstrates that DPStab achieves state-of-the-art performance in both {Delta}{Delta}G and {Delta}Tm prediction. Practical evaluations confirm DPStab's capability in accurately ranking protein stability on large-scale datasets and effectively identifying critical structural contacts impacting stability.

Current variant effect predictors often fall short in this domain due to computational burdens, reliance on multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), and limited ability to generalize to TMP-specific constraints. Here we present Memo-Patho, an alignment-free deep learning framework specifically optimized for TMP mutation pathogenicity prediction. Memo-Patho integrates global and local representations from protein language models (PLMs) and predicted structural features. Furthermore, it introduces a contrastive pre-training strategy that learns discriminative features by comparing benign and pathogenic mutations within the same protein backbone. This design enables the model to capture functional disruptions in challenging contexts without structural or evolutionary alignments. Memo-Patho outperforms state-of-the-art predictors on two types of TMP benchmark datasets (accuracy up to 0.93) and unseen-protein generalization tasks, showing strong agreement with evolutionary conservation profiles. Its predictions are further validated on a manually curated KCNQ1 dataset of 55 ion channel variants, achieving an accuracy of 0.84 and outperforming existing tools. The model also supports high-throughput scanning, efficiently analyzing over 15000 variants in under 80 minutes. Our results establish Memo-Patho as a fast, generalizable, and biologically grounded approach for variant effect prediction in TMPs.

However, the mechanisms by which early-life dietary interventions influence adult physiology and longevity remain poorly understood. Here, using Drosophila as a model, we demonstrate that protein restriction during the larval stage (early-life protein restriction, ePR) promotes adult lifespan by reducing storage protein levels. Stable isotope tracing reveals that dietary amino acids obtained in the larval stage are retained into adulthood, especially incorporated into ribosomal proteins. This is mediated by larval serum protein 2 (Lsp2), a major storage protein, whose expression is durably downregulated by ePR. Both dietary (ePR) and genetic (Lsp2-RNAi) reduction of the protein storage lead to decreased ribosomal protein levels and translation activity in early adulthood. Notably, these storage proteins are enriched in aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine, and larval dietary tyrosine restriction alone is sufficient to suppress translation and promote longevity. These findings show that storage proteins mediate the effect of larval nutrition on adult longevity via controlling translation. Our study uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism of nutritional memory that links early-life nutrition to adult physiology and lifespan.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Hence, EE provides us with a behavioral model and neuronal targets to identify 'anti-craving' relevant mechanisms.

Chemogenetic inhibition of cue-reactive neurons in PL blocked cue-evoked sucrose seeking, thereby confirming the function of these neurons in sucrose cue memory. EE boosted the baseline excitability of 'originally', or before EE exposure, cue-reactive, excitatory pyramidal cells in PL. Furthermore, their sucrose cue-specificity was lost resulting in their persistent activation and non-cue selective activation or 'excitatory overdrive'. Furthermore, EE reduced recruitment of cue-reactive, inhibitory interneurons reflecting 'inhibitory underdrive'.

Pathological tau accumulates at sites of invagination, inducing structural abnormalities in the nuclear envelope and piercing into the nuclear space.

Oxylipin chemical signaling by diatoms has been extensively studied in the Mediterranean Sea where oxylipins are linked to grazing with subsequent insidious effects on copepod reproduction 6 -13. Culture studies with diatoms have shown that stress, growth phase, and viral infection also impact oxylipin production 14 -16. This study provides the first glimpse into the role of oxylipins as biomarkers and chemical signals during diatom viral infection at sea. Biomarkers for lysis and senescence were identified in laboratory experiments and observed at elevated concentrations in meta-lipidomes collected in the California Coastal Ecosystem (CCE) where diatoms had recently been lysed by viruses 17. Deck-board incubations with natural communities showed that oxylipins stimulate particle-attached and surface-ocean microbes in a dose and community-dependent manner, while inhibiting microzooplankton grazing and phytoplankton growth rates. Carbon export was two times higher at the Post-lytic site than elsewhere along the transect consistent with the viral shuttle, whereby viruses facilitate carbon export. We previously reported enhanced enzymatic activity at the Post-lytic site 17, suggestive of the viral shunt, whereby carbon is remineralized or attenuated into non-sinking dissolved organic matter. Here we layer geochemical evidence to show that lysis of oxylipin producing diatoms amplified the vertical flux of carbon from the surface ocean even in the presence of viral shunt processes.

We utilized the Drosophila Genomic Reference Panel (DGRP), consisting of 205 fully sequenced inbred lines, and measured relative expression levels of all core clock genes in 120 lines via qPCR at a single time point (two hours after light onset).

To address this critical gap, this work presents SKiD (Structure-oriented Kinetics Database), a comprehensive, structured database integrating kcat and Km values with the corresponding 3D structural data. This is accomplished by integrating data from existing bioinformatics resources using automated programs to process the data and enhancing it with computational predictions. The erroneous data encountered during data integration is manually resolved. Metadata such as literature and assay conditions (e.g., pH and temperature) are preserved.

However, inconsistencies across studies have hindered a comprehensive understanding of their role in AD and their potential as reliable diagnostic biomarkers. To address this, we conducted a cross-cohort integrative analysis (CCIA) of raw 16S rRNA sequencing data and metadata from the largest available dataset to date, encompassing 1,522 samples across 10 independent studies. We identified consistent microbial signatures distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. Significant alterations were observed in both -diversity and community composition between AD and control groups, while lesional and non-lesional sites within AD patients showed no significant differences. Given the impact of confounding factors on the skin microbiota, we applied MMUPHin framework to correct for batch effects and performed subgroup analyses based on different batches. Differential taxa were identified using Permutation testing, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and LEfSe analysis. These features were used to develop predictive models with four machine learning algorithms, achieving high diagnostic accuracy in an independent validation cohort (AUROC = 0.83). Our study provides a comprehensive reference of skin microbial alterations in AD, offering valuable insights into host microbe interactions and highlighting their potential as diagnostic biomarkers for early detection and targeted therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Cervical mucus can thicken to prevent ascension of sperm into the upper reproductive tract or thin to permit fertilization. Current reproductive studies of mucus viscoelastic properties rely on subjective visual appraisal of cervical mucus changes. Our goal was to use particle tracking microrheology (PTMR) to objectively assess cervical mucus viscoelastic properties and associate these measurements with in vitro measures of sperm velocity. Methods: Using cervical mucus obtained from rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) at necropsy, we used to PTMR to measure viscoelasticity (*) under stepwise, serial dilutions. In parallel we measure sperm velocity using custom sperm tracking and analysis workflows. Results: We report that both mucus * and sperm velocity displayed a concentration-dependent behavior, where * increased as mucus concentration increased, and sperm velocity correspondingly decreased. Viscoelasticity and sperm velocity were strongly negatively correlated (p<0.001). Conclusions: PTMR and sperm tracking in mucus provide quantitative measure of viscoelastic mucus changes.

In VitA deficient (VAD) mice, acquisition of effector responses is impeded, but little is known about maintenance and expression of previously acquired effector function under the VAD conditions. We examined the impact of VAD on progression of autoimmune diseases using two models of uveitis, experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) induced by active immunization and spontaneous uveitis in retina-specific T cell receptor transgenic (R161H) mice, and in the model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). VAD was induced by dietary lack of VitA from before birth, or by daily injections of a pan-RA receptor inhibitor BMS493 in adult mice fed with the standard diet. VAD mice were essentially resistant to induction of EAU or EAE and displayed impaired effector T cell responses. Defective priming/acquisition of effector function by VAD T cells was also evident. By contrast, spontaneously uveitic R161H mice fed with VAD diet, in which priming of pathogenic T cells occurs before onset of full VAD, only moderately attenuated uveitis compared to VitA sufficient R161H mice. To reconcile somewhat different results between induced model and spontaneous model of uveitis, we examined EAU in partial VAD mice or adoptive transfer into VAD hosts. The results supported that effector T cells primed in VitA-sufficient environment were able to function in VAD environment and induced EAU. We conclude that although priming of naive T cells in the VAD environment is defective, effector function acquired under VitA sufficient conditions is maintained and can be expressed under VAD conditions. Because dietary lack of VitA is rarely profound and may be seasonal, our findings may shed light on immunity and autoimmunity in geographical regions where dietary VitA is limiting.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing, in situ hybridization, and live reporters to define the identity of blood cell states from a basal chordate, Ciona robusta. We find evidence that C. robusta circulating blood contains a differentiation hierarchy that gives rise to at least eight major morphotypes, constituting approximately half of mature blood cell states. The mature cell states include phagocytes, as well as cells variously expressing vanadium-binding proteins, carbonic anhydrases, pattern recognition receptors, cytokines, and complement factors. Despite the expression of homologs to vertebrate immune components, extensive divergence between tunicate and vertebrate immune cells obscures cell state homology.

M.; Rizuan, A.; Mohanty, P.; Mittal, J.", "abstract": "Protein aggregation, which is implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, typically involves a transition from soluble monomers and oligomers to insoluble fibrils. Polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts in proteins can form amyloid fibrils, which are linked to polyQ diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD), where the length of the polyQ tract inversely correlates with the age of onset. Despite significant research on the mechanisms of Httex1 aggregation, atomistic information regarding the intermediate stages of its fibrillation and the morphological characteristics of the end-state amyloid fibrils remains limited. Recently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations based on a hybrid multistate structure-based model, Multi-eGO, have shown promise in capturing the kinetics and mechanism of amyloid fibrillation with high computational efficiency while achieving qualitative agreement with experiments. Here, we utilize the multi-eGO simulation methodology to study the mechanism and kinetics of polyQ fibrillation and the effect of the N17 flanking domain of Huntingtin protein. Aggregation simulations of polyQ produced highly heterogeneous amyloid fibrils with variable-width branched morphologies by incorporating combinations of {beta}-turn, {beta}-arc, and {beta}-strand structures, while the presence of the N17 flanking domain reduces amyloid fibril heterogeneity by favoring {beta}-strand conformations. Our simulations reveal that the presence of N17 domain enhances aggregation kinetics by promoting the formation of large, structurally stable oligomers. Furthermore, the early-stage aggregation process involves two distinct mechanisms: backbone interactions driving {beta}-sheet formation and side-chain interdigitation. Overall, our study provides detailed insights into fibrillation kinetics, mechanisms, and end-state polymorphism associated with Httex1 amyloid aggregation.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

The promise is that they are able to constrain underlying kinetic models much more efficiently than bulk kinetics, but the challenge is that completion times alone can incompletely determine complex reaction topologies. Gamma distributions or mechanistic models have often been used to estimate kinetic parameters for such data, but the gamma distribution relies on homogenous processes contributing to the rate-limiting behavior of the system. Here, we introduce hypoexponential analysis to estimate heterogeneous kinetic processes. We demonstrate that hypoexponential fitting can indeed estimate rate constants separated by 2-3 orders of magnitude. We then apply this approach to measurements of SARS-CoV-2 entry, showing that ACE2 reduces the number of rate-limiting steps but does not change the rates of these kinetic processes. We propose a kinetic model whereby SARS-CoV-2 entry is driven by a mixture of ACE2-accelerated and ACE2-independent spike protein activation events.

Variations in the primary amino acid sequence of IAPP can influence its aggregation rate and animals expressing IAPP variants that do not form amyloids, do not develop T2D. Conversely, specific single amino -acid changes in IAPP are enough to accelerate its aggregation rate. Understanding how mutations impact IAPP aggregation can help gain mechanistic understanding into the process of pathogenic amyloid formation of this peptide and preventively identify mutations that may contribute to the risk of developing T2D. Here, we employ deep mutational scanning to measure the ability to nucleate amyloids for 1663 IAPP variants, including substitutions, insertions, truncations and deletions and identify variants that increase amyloid formation in all mutation classes. Our results point at a continuous stretch of residues (15-32) which likely is structured in IAPP amyloids and that matches the core of the early aggregated species formed by IAPP in vitro. Inside this region, mutations have a more drastic effect in the 21-27 NNFGAIL segment, suggesting tighter structural constraints for this stretch in IAPP amyloids. Finally, by comparing this mutational atlas to that of another amyloid, Amyloid beta (A{beta}42), the peptide that aggregates in Alzheimer's Disease, we find that the effects of mutations that slow down nucleation correlate between the two amyloids, but that when it comes to mutations that accelerate nucleation one single amyloid dataset cannot be used to predict mutational effects in the other.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Specifically, {Omega}-shaped clathrin assemblies function as the coat of endocytic vesicles, while flat clathrin assemblies, also known as flat clathrin lattices, serve as signaling hubs for various signaling pathways. Multiple flat clathrin lattices exist on the cell membrane, and these lattices grow after epidermal growth factor stimulation (EGF) and then return to baseline. In this work, we used a particle-based model to simulate the assembly and disassembly of flat clathrin lattices to capture these dynamics. We found that the formation of flat clathrin lattices is highly dynamic, that is, cluster number, size and dwelling time often change even in the absence of any stimulus. Moreover, these key features are affected by adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) number, clathrin-clathrin binding rate, and clathrin diffusion coefficient. Specifically, an increase in AP-2 number leads to the transition from no cluster, short-lasting multiple small clusters, to a long-lasting single giant cluster. An increased clathrin-clathrin binding rate or decreased clathrin diffusion coefficient both result in an increased cluster number, reduced cluster size, and shortened dwelling time. Furthermore, we also predicted that under EGF stimulation, simultaneous changes in the AP-2 number, the clathrin-clathrin binding rate, and the clathrin diffusion coefficient can reproduce the experimentally observed trend of FCLs: an increase in cluster number and size in the first 30 minutes, followed by a decrease after 30 minutes.

In this study, we employ microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, mutational scanning and binding free energy calculations together with dynamic network modeling to dissect how engineered DARPin proteins K27, K55, K13, and K1 engage KRAS through diverse molecular mechanisms ranging from effector mimicry to conformational restriction and allosteric modulation. Mutational scanning across all four DARPin systems identifies a core set of evolutionarily constrained residues that function as universal hotspots in KRAS recognition. KRAS residues I36, Y40, M67, and H95 consistently emerge as critical contributors to binding stability. Binding free energy computations show that despite similar binding modes K27 relies heavily on electrostatic contributions from major binding hotspots while K55 exploits a dense hydrophobic cluster enhancing its effector-mimetic signature. Allosteric binders K13 and K19 , by contrast, stabilize a KRAS-specific pocket introducing new hinges and bottlenecks that rewire the communication architecture of KRAS without full immobilization. Network-based analysis reveals a strikingly consistent theme: despite their distinct mechanisms of recognition, all systems engage a unifying allosteric architecture that spans multiple functional motifs. This architecture is not only preserved across complexes but also mirrors the intrinsic communication framework of KRAS itself, where specific residues function as central hubs transmitting conformational changes across the protein. By integrating dynamic profiling, energetic mapping, and network-modeling our study provides a multi-scale mechanistic roadmap for targeting KRAS, revealing how engineered proteins can exploit both conserved motifs and isoform-specific features to enable precision modulation of KRAS signaling in oncogenic contexts.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that a simple model, including only protein-protein and protein-chromatin interactions, effectively explains the aberrant looping observed around oncogenes, such as PBX3, in cells expressing the NUP98-HOXA9 chimeric protein, which is associated with leukemia. In this scenario, looping occurs through a switch-like mechanism controlled by the concentration of the chimera and its affinity with chromatin. Moreover, when incorporating the presence of extruding factors in a more complex model, similar results are observed, indicating a mild dependence of this looping mechanism on loop-extrusion activity.

While metformin's therapeutic potential has been proposed in various inflammatory conditions, its role in modulating PDGF signaling in TED remains unexplored. Methods: OFs were isolated from TED (n= 14) and non-TED subjects (n=4). OFs were treated with PDGF{beta} (25 ng/mL) and/or AMPK activators metformin (1-5 mM) and AICAR (0.4-1 mM).

In addition, degrading HA via hyaluronidase PH20 overexpression impaired liver function manifested by increased serum aminotransferase (ALT) activity levels. These findings challenge both the role of HA modulation in 4-MU's action and the strategy of targeting HA to treat liver fibrosis. Additional mouse models also excluded the possibility that 4-MU modulates intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) to inhibit liver fibrosis. Ablation of gut microbiota partially abolishes 4-MU's anti-liver fibrosis effect. However, the anti-liver fibrosis effect of 4-MU was lost in the lower-dose group, and the high dose's effect in reducing ALT disappeared over time despite its liver fibrosis-reducing effect. Based on these findings, we argue that the lack of efficacy of 4-MU at a translatable dose and lack of a clear mechanism that allows further improvement of 4-MU's efficacy make 4-MU impractical for development as an anti-liver fibrosis treatment.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Recent work has identified the summer solstice (21 June) as a phenological \"switch point,\" with pre-solstice warming advancing autumn bud set and post-solstice warming delaying it. However, the flexibility of this switch point remains poorly understood. We performed trans-solstice climate manipulation experiments on potted European beech (Fagus sylvatica) saplings to test (i) how spring leaf-out timing and June-August temperatures influence growth cessation (bud set), and (ii) whether daytime and nighttime temperatures before and after the solstice have different effects, given that trees primarily grow at night. Each day delay in spring leaf-out delayed bud set by 0.24 {+/-} 0.06 days on average. July cooling delayed bud set by 4.9 {+/-} 2.6 days in late-leafing individuals but had no effect in early-leafing ones. Conversely, August cooling advanced bud set by 4.4-4.5 {+/-} 2.6 days in all trees. Daytime cooling before the solstice had no effect, while after the solstice it advanced bud set. Nighttime cooling always delayed bud set. Our findings support the Solstice-as-Phenology-Switch model and highlight the central role of developmental progression in constraining the growing seasons of temperate trees. Faster early-season development-especially under nighttime warming-advances the point at which trees become sensitive to late-season cooling, thereby triggering senescence earlier. To improve growing season length projections, phenological models must account for these developmentally-mediated and diel-specific responses to warming.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Digital twins offer an ideal tool for overcoming this gap because they enable estimation, tracking, and forecasting of unmeasured physiological states. Here, we introduce CereBRLSIM (Cerebral Blood Regulation Latent State Inference and Modeling), a digital twin that integrates physiological knowledge and patient data to infer CVR function and predict cerebral dynamics.

Through systematic X-ray crystallographic analysis of human syntenin-1's PDZ1-PDZ2 tandem, we resolve nine high-resolution structures that uncover fundamental differences in conformational plasticity between these sequentially similar domains. Pairwise root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) analysis of 20 PDZ1 structures across multiple crystal forms reveals substantial structural variability concentrated in the Lys119-Ile125 and Ala181-Glu184 loops - key regions governing ligand specificity within PDZ1's binding cleft. In stark contrast, PDZ2 maintains remarkable structural conservation across all crystallographic environments, indicating divergent evolutionary constraints on these tandem domains. Crucially, comparative analysis of isotropic B-factors demonstrates their inadequacy in capturing the full scope of conformational heterogeneity, emphasizing the necessity of multi-structure comparisons for mapping dynamic landscapes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations implemented through GROMACS corroborate these crystallographic observations, showing elevated residue-specific fluctuation (RMSF) values in PDZ1's ligand-binding interface compared to analogous PDZ2 regions. This consistency across experimental and computational approaches confirms that PDZ1's conformational diversity represents an inherent biophysical property rather than crystallographic artifact. The observed dynamic asymmetry suggests a functional division of labor: PDZ1's structural plasticity enables broad ligand recognition via conformational selection mechanisms, while PDZ2's rigid architecture likely stabilizes the tandem domain arrangement. These findings provide an atomic-level rationale for syntenin-1's pleiotropic roles in cellular signaling and establish a structural blueprint for developing domain-selective therapeutics.

M.; Maiti, P. K.", "abstract": "N-linked glycans are important in the elicitation and the activity of many broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1. The high conformational flexibility of glycans hindered detailed atomistic investigations of and glycan-bNAb interactions, including glycan shielding of bNAbs. Importantly, how these interactions vary across different HIV-1 clades remains unclear. The variability in the number and location of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) on the envelope (Env) protein across clades can lead to differences in glycan dynamics and topology, potentially affecting Env-bNAb interactions and the clade-specific efficacy of bNAb-based therapies. Here, we combined comprehensive glycan conformational sampling, using the software glycoSHIELD, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model fully glycosylated trimeric Env for six HIV-1 strains, one from each of the clades A, B, C, G, CRF01 AE (01 AE) and CRF07 BC (07 BC). We assessed the interactions of 50 different bNAbs, drawn from all the major bNAb classes, with each of these strains, quantifying glycan shielding, glycan-bNAb interactions, and their clade-specific variations for each bNAb in microscopic detail. Our findings reveal that while glycans cover most of the exposed surface area in all clades, the amount of accessible surface varies, with clade B having the minimum and clade 07 BC the maximum antibody accessible surface area. The number of glycan conformers per glycosylation site also varies with clades, even for conserved sites. Overall, we observed that bNAbs interact with more glycans than previously reported in experimental and computational studies. Important variations emerge in Env-bNAb interactions with clades and bNAb-class. These atomic-level insights will be valuable for improving bNAb-based therapies and vaccine design strategies against HIV-1.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Fast inactivation is an essential auto-inhibitory mechanism and requisite component of sodium channel physiology. Recent structural and electrophysiological results are inconsistent with the canonical ball and chain model of fast inactivation thus necessitating an updated theoretical framework. Here, we use encoded fluorescence spectroscopy and high-resolution electrophysiology to capture key steps in the fast inactivation mechanism, from voltage-sensor activation to pore occlusion, an ultra-fast process which occurs in less than 2 milliseconds. Upon depolarization, activation of the domain IV voltage sensor initiates cytoplasmic DIII_DIV linker movement and quickly repositions the IFM motif into a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the pore. This triggers a structural rearrangement of the pocket. The phenylalanine of the IFM motif contacts the pore-forming helices via a hydrophobic interaction with S6 of DIV and an aromatic/hydrophobic interaction with S6 of DIIII. These two interactions occur only after both S6 segments rotate, thus exposing the hydrophobic gate into the pore producing the fast inactivation. Based on the current results, we propose an alternative lock and key model to explain the molecular mechanism of fast inactivation.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

The radiobiological factors unique to carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT), such as high linear energy transfer (LET) and less dependence on oxygen, make it well-suited to overcome the PDAC TME. Here, we utilized clonal syngeneic KPC pancreatic tumor cell lines and tumors to examine this postulate and to identify underlying factors that impact the response of PDAC to CIRT. While KPC cell lines exhibited radiobiologic effectiveness (RBE) greater than 3, subcutaneous tumors in the mouse hind leg showed lower RBEs 1.3 based on quintupling time at a LET of 75 keV/um. Four days after CIRT, we observed widespread transcriptomic changes in the tumor immune microenvironment (TME), suggesting increased infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells, elevated expression of anti-tumor T cell cytokines, MHC class I molecules, and co-stimulatory signals. Fewer immunologic changes were observed following photon irradiation. By seven days after CIRT, tumor-supportive transcriptomic programs characterized by pro-tumor cytokines, M2 macrophages, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) emerged, promoting resistance and limiting the durability of tumor growth delay. These findings suggest that CIRT may offer a favorable platform compared to conventional photon radiation therapy for combining with immunotherapies. Furthermore, these data highlight the risk of using in vitro survival data alone in treatment planning and indicate that underlying TME factors impact the response of PDAC in vivo.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

The present work identifies, and provides corrections for, common methodological pitfalls in PPI analysis that compromise model validity. Firstly, if the seed time series is extracted with prewhitening, the temporal structure of the signal is altered and subsequent deconvolution of prewhitened data becomes suboptimal. Furthermore, prewhitening again during model fitting results in double prewhitening of the seed regressor. Secondly, a failure to mean-centre the task regressor when calculating the interaction term can also lead to model misspecification and potentially spurious inferences. By using simulations and empirical language fMRI data from the Australian Epilepsy Project, we demonstrate the adverse effects of these issues, and how they are resolved when corrected. A systematic review of current practices revealed widespread model misspecification, and underreporting of methods, in published PPI studies. We provide clearer reporting guidelines, and advocate for appropriate methods for handling of prewhitening and mean-centring to ensure the validity of PPI analyses.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Different strategies are currently evaluated to enhance drug delivery across the BBB, among which the development of vector molecules that target specific receptors expressed by BBB endothelial cells and involved in receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT). In this process, therapeutic cargos conjugated to optimized molecular vectors can undergo trans-endothelial transport and delivery in the brain parenchyma. The transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is enriched in brain endothelial cells and is one of the most studied receptors for drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS). Several antibodies and molecules derived thereof that target TfR1 have been developed, but few display trans-species reactivity, hindering preclinical or clinical development. In the present study, we selected and characterized cross-species reactive Variable domain of Heavy chain only antibody from camelids (VHH), and in particular the C5 and B8, that bind rodent, rhesus monkey and human TfR1. When fused to a human Immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1) Fc region, the C5 or B8 monomers or homodimers were up taken by engineered CHO cells expressing the rodent, human and rhesus monkey TfR1, and by rodent or human brain endothelial cells. Key human TfR1 amino-acid residues of the C5 and B8 epitopes were identified based on the generation of human TfR1 mutants. Assessment of their functional binding revealed an original binding region at the interface of the TfR1 dimer. Following systemic injection in mice of VHH-Fc fusions displaying different properties in terms of affinity and avidity toward TfR1, we demonstrated improved brain uptake compared to control molecules encompassing an irrelevant VHH. Brain delivery efficiency of the parental and optimized VHHTfR1 was further demonstrated using Neurotensin (NT)-induced hypothermia as a read-out in wild-type mice and in B-hTfR transgenic mice expressing the human TfR1 ectodomain. We established in vitro-in vivo correlations between the human TfR1 binding properties determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of VHH-NT affinity variants, and their potential to induce hypothermia in B-hTfR mice. We identified key human TfR1 binding parameters leading to efficient BBB transcytosis i.e: a rapid dissociation rate and intermediate affinity. Some of the C5 and B8 variants we engineered presented promising cross-species reactivity towards the murine but also rhesus monkey TfR1. We also generated variants with very similar human-rhesus monkey TfR1 binding properties and optimal affinities for TfR1-dependant transcytosis.

Adipocytes play a critical role in the development of obesity-induced insulin resistance, with several signaling pathways influencing insulin sensitivity. Among these, p38 MAP kinases are essential for adipose tissue physiology and the regulation of processes such as differentiation, thermogenesis, and inflammation. p38 activation is mediated by the upstream kinases MKK3 and MKK6 in response to inflammatory signals. While MKK6 inhibition promotes browning and thermogenesis and protects against obesity, the role of MKK3 remains unclear. Here, we investigated the function of MKK3 in adipose tissue. In human adipose tissue samples, MKK3 expression was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and negatively correlated with glycated hemoglobin, a marker of hyperglycemia. Using whole-body and adipose-specific Mkk3 and p38-beta knockout mice, we found that Mkk3 activation in adipose tissue during obesity enhances insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, adipose tissue from Mkk3- or p38beta-deficient mice exhibited elevated basal p70S6K activity compared with wild-type controls. This increased p70S6K activity was linked to higher serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) and impaired insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation, contributing to worsened insulin resistance.

Progress has been limited by the lack of short-lived, genetically tractable model organisms with functional DNA methylation systems. The jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, offers a unique solution. It combines a functional DNA methylation system with a short lifespan and established tools for experimental manipulation. We previously developed an epigenetic clock in Nasonia, but whether this clock reflects plastic, environmentally driven ageing processes was unknown. Here, we test this directly by experimentally inducing larval diapause, a naturally occurring developmental arrest triggered by environmental cues. Diapause extended median adult lifespan by 36% and significantly slowed the rate of epigenetic ageing. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing across multiple adult timepoints, we show that while diapaused adults initially emerge epigenetically older, their subsequent epigenetic ageing proceeds 29% more slowly than non-diapaused controls. Clock CpGs were enriched for gene ontology terms related to conserved nutrient-sensing and developmental pathways, including insulin/IGF signaling and mTOR, supporting the established mechanistic link between development and epigenetic ageing.

However, the need for frequent dosing with pills or injections often leads to suboptimal medication adherence and reduced effectiveness-an issue common to many chronic conditions. Long-acting drug delivery implants offer a compelling alternative by enabling autonomous, multi-year drug release, thereby improving real-world adherence and treatment outcomes. However, user acceptability and access are limited by need for invasive insertion and surgical end-of-life removal, particularly in low-resource settings, as well as by limited drug loading and suboptimal drug utilization efficiency, which constrain both the duration of therapy and the range of drugs that can be effectively delivered. To address these limitations, we developed the Monolithic Shape-shifting Absorbable Implants for Chronic Care (MoSAIC) platform-a minimally invasive, fully bioresorbable system that integrates compacted drug formulations with a space-efficient device architecture. This approach reduces implant size, eliminates the need for surgical removal, and prolongs therapeutic duration compared to existing implants. We develop compacted formulations of the contraceptive drug levonorgestrel (LNG), and other poorly water-solubility drugs, demonstrating exceptional drug loading (100% w/w) and multi-year sustained drug release via surface-mediated dissolution in rats. When incorporated into MoSAIC devices, these formulations enable high-efficiency drug loading and zero-order drug release kinetics with geometrically tunable rates and durations. As a result, MoSAIC systems can be designed to be smaller, less invasive, and/or longer lasting than current contraceptive implants such as Jadelle(R) and Nexplanon(R). The MoSAIC platform expands access to reversible contraception and supports long-term medication adherence, with the potential to improve health outcomes and quality of life. More broadly, it provides a flexible approach for delivering other potent, low-solubility therapeutics and lays the foundation for a \"dose it and forget it\" paradigm in chronic disease management, where adherence is designed into the therapy itself.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Upon activation, DCs undergo changes in their transcriptome, phenotype, and function, depending on the tissue microenvironment. The role of DC activation during human chronic inflammation has yet to be explored. To address this, we aimed to investigate activated DCs across a range of chronically inflamed human tissues, with a focus on cervical lymph nodes (LNs). We performed scRNAseq and flow cytometry on healthy, acutely, chronically inflamed, and cancer-associated human cervical (LNs) and identified a novel inflammation-associated DC (iaDC) cell state, found only within chronically inflamed LNs. iaDCs were defined by a unique cytokine expression profile (CXCL9, CXCL10, IL1B) and could be phenotypically distinguished from other activated DCs by their elevated expression of CD1C, CD206, CD319, and CD274. Functionally, we found that IFNg signaling induces DC2s to enter the iaDC cell state and that this process can be abrogated by inhibition of JAK-STAT signaling. Using spatial transcriptomics, we observed LN iaDC residing within a specific chronic inflammatory niche, which was enriched for inflammatory monocytes, NK cells, and effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Extrapolating our findings to other chronic inflammation-associated diseases, we similarly observed the emergence of iaDCs within the intestines of treatment-resistant Crohns Disease patients, synovial membranes and lymph nodes of rheumatoid arthritis patients and lungs of sarcoidosis patients. Similarly to the lymph node, iaDCs were found to reside in conserved chronic inflammation-associated spatial niches within the small intestine of affected individuals and displayed equivalent transcriptional characteristics and surrounding cellular neighborhoods. Collectively, these data highlight a previously unexplored role of iaDCs in human chronic inflammatory diseases and propose a conserved spatially restricted iaDC-populated chronic inflammatory niche associated with resistance to therapy. These findings highlight novel avenues to shape inflammatory trajectories by targeting iaDCs and their spatial niches, for example, by inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Applied to dense terrylene samples with 150 ms acquisition time, our method significantly reduces reconstruction error compared to Richardson-Lucy deconvolution and ThunderSTORM multi-emitter fitting. The results confirm the ability to resolve emitters separated by 35 nm at 580 nm wavelength, corresponding to sevenfold resolution improvement beyond the Rayleigh criterion.

A.", "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are key agents of genome evolution across all domains of life. These mobile genetic elements can cause mutations through transposition or by promoting structural rearrangements. Stress conditions can amplify TE activity, either by impairing TE suppression mechanisms or through stress-induced interactions between transcription factors and TE sequences, offering a route for rapid genetic change. As such, TEs represent an important source of adaptability within populations. To investigate the interplay between environmental stress and eukaryotic TE dynamics relevant to infectious disease, we examined how heat stress and nutrient limitation affect TE mobility in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans, using a collection of clinical and environmental isolates. Seven distinct mobile element families, encompassing diverse retrotransposons and DNA transposons, were captured mobilizing to confer antifungal resistance, including a novel element, CNEST, which belongs to the CACTA, Mirage, Chapaev (CMC) supergroup. Heat stress at human body temperature (37 degrees Celsius) significantly increased the mobilization of a subset of these TEs, leading to higher rates of acquired antifungal resistance. Whole-genome assemblies revealed that, compared to retrotransposons, DNA transposons were hypomethylated and approximately uniformly distributed throughout the genome, features that may contribute to their frequent mobilization. We further assessed TE-driven genomic changes within hosts using serial isolates from patients with recurrent cryptococcal infections and from isolates passaged through mice. While we observed evidence of TE copy number changes near chromosome ends, we found no indication of TE-mediated alterations near gene-coding regions across any of the serial isolates. Finally, TE mobility was isolate- and strain-dependent, with significant variation even among clonally related isolates collected from the same patient, emphasizing the role of genetic background in shaping TE activity. Together, these findings reveal a complex, dynamic relationship between environmental stress, genetic background, and TE mobility, with important implications for adaptation and acquired antifungal resistance in C. neoformans.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

M.; Cummings, J.; Garman, E.; Solomon, J.; Soriano Martinez, K.", "abstract": "Many organisms carry extra, non-essential chromosomes known as B chromosomes (Bs), which are selfishly transmitted at super-Mendelian levels to offspring. This heightened transmission, termed drive, occurs during gametogenesis, usually in one of the two parents. In some cases, Bs can experience an opposing process, drag, which reduces their transmission. If these processes occur together in the same organism, one in each parental sex, then they may facilitate the spread of Bs while countering their accumulation in the genome to harmful levels. While previous studies have elucidated mechanistic aspects of B drive, little is known about drag or other factors that govern the inheritance of these selfish genetic elements. Here we examined the inheritance of Paternal Sex Ratio (PSR), a single-copy B in the jewel wasp, Nasonia vitripennis, which is transmitted paternally to offspring. PSR drives by converting female-destined embryos into PSR-transmitting males. Using genetic manipulation, we produced exceptional PSR-carrying females, which were used to assess B transmission potential. We found that females transmit PSR at unexpectedly low levels compared to univalent chromosomes in other organisms. This reduced transmission stems from remarkable loss of PSR from the egg's nucleus upon entry into meiosis, an effect that may be caused by an absence of microtubule-based spindle fibers in meiosis I-arrested wasp eggs. We also found that PSR is strictly limited to a single copy per genome, suggesting that two PSR copies are lethal during development. Our findings reveal the successful inheritance of this selfish B chromosome involves a restriction to a single copy and hidden female meiotic drag in addition to its strong paternal drive.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Nbs towards soluble proteins are routinely developed via alpaca immunization or directed evolution in yeast cell-surface display. However, for membrane proteins, the targets are generally detergent-solubilized, and there remains a need for Nb development methods against membrane proteins in a native-like membrane environment. To address this need, we present a protocol for Nb selection via extraction of membrane proteins into amphiphilic polymers such as styrene-maleic acid to produce purified membrane proteins in stable liponanoparticles. Proof of generality is demonstrated by applying the pipeline to four membrane-resident enzymes of differing fold, oligomerization state, and membrane topology (reentrant membrane helix, transmembrane, membrane-associated). Following screening for optimal stabilization into liponanoparticles, Nbs were selected against four target proteins from glycoconjugate biosynthesis pathways. The selected Nbs showed high affinity and selectivity towards their target proteins with KD apparent values ranging from 15 nM to 200 nM, depending on the Nb-protein conjugate. In accordance with their tight binding, various Nb-protein complexes were found to be stable to size-exclusion chromatography purification. The Nbs were also amenable to sortase-mediated ligation, enabling their conversion into molecular probes for the target membrane protein. The ability to select for such high-affinity Nb against membrane proteins in SMALP will facilitate their widespread application in cell biology and biomedical applications.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

To examine how neuronal mTOR signaling discriminates between distinct stimuli, we quantified phosphorylation events and protein co-association networks in primary mouse cortical neurons. Unexpectedly, neuronal mTOR activation by IGF or glutamate triggered dissociation-rather than the anticipated assembly-of protein complexes involving mTOR complex1 (TORC1), mTOR complex 2 (TORC2), and translational machinery, distinguishing neurons from proliferative cells. Applying in vitro homeostatic scaling paradigms revealed distinct combinatorial encoding of synaptic scaling direction: both up- and down-scaling induced dissociation of translational complexes, but downscaling uniquely included dissociation of upstream pathway regulators. Cortical neurons from Shank3B knockout mice, modeling autism-associated Phelan-McDermid Syndrome, displayed baseline hyperactivation of the mTOR network, which reduced the dynamic range of network responses to homeostatic scaling and pharmacological inhibition.

We describe the synthesis and characterize reaction rates of 29 tetrazine amino acids (20 of which are new) and compare their encoding ability into proteins using evolved Tet ncAA encoding tRNA/RS pairs. For these systems, we characterized on-protein Tet stability, reaction rates, and ligation extents, as the utility of a bioorthogonal labeling group depends on its stability and reactivity when encoded into proteins. By integrating data on encoding efficiency, selectivity, on-protein stability, and in-cell labeling for Tet tRNA/RS pairs, we developed the smallest, fastest, and most stable Tet system to date. This was achieved by introducing fluorine substituents to Tet4, resulting in reaction rates at the 10^6 M^-1 s^-1 level while minimizing degradation. This study expands the toolbox of bioorthogonal reagents for Tet-sTCO-based, site-specific protein labeling and demonstrates that the Tet-ncAA is a uniquely tunable, highly reactive, and encodable bioorthogonal functional group.

In this study, we focus on Nup98-HOXA9 (NHA9), a chimeric transcription factor implicated in leukemogenesis, in which two FG-repeat-rich IDRs derived from Nup98 get fused to the C-terminal part of transcription factor HOXA9.

We found that the FG domain has different conformational compactness in the monomeric state, oligomeric, and densely packed condensate state. Notably, the oligomeric state exhibits micelle-like organisation, with the DNA-binding domain exposed at the periphery. While their architecture is non-random, their sizes depend on NHA9 concentration, consistent with non-core-shell spherical micelles. Molecular dynamics simulations support the expansion behaviour of NHA9 FG domain as oligomeric assemblies grow in size and reveal micelle-like structural features in oligomeric assemblies.

The transfection efficiencies of PSP condensates for delivering DNA and mRNA were also significantly greater than those of a commercial transfection agent.

Concurrently, black-brane geometries, long studied in gravitational physics, can find unexpected analogues in the interplay of active matter dynamics and the brain s neuroanatomical organization. Motivated by these parallels, we posit a generalized holographic framework and interrogate its validity through the fluid/gravity duality; a correspondence linking hydrodynamic equations to gravitational spacetime metrics. In this work, we explore the holographic principles at the Navier-Stokes regime, demonstrating that holography can model key neurophysiological mechanisms: cerebral autoregulation (the brain s hemodynamic self-stabilization) and neurovascular coupling (the dynamic neuron-bloodflow interplay). This work bridges holography, active matter physics, and neuroscience, proposing a unified framework to decode the brain s multiscale organization, its resilience to perturbations, and its computational capabilities. By grounding neurovascular physiology in gravitational duals, we open pathways to reinterpret brain function through the lens of emergent spacetime geometry.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

This raises the hitherto untested possibility that heterogeneity of the untransformed tumor stroma can actively fuel malignant progression. As biological heterogeneity is inherently difficult to define and control, we here chose a highly reductionist bottom-up approach and let tumor cells invade into micro-engineered environments harboring obstacles with precision-controlled geometry. We find that not only the presence of obstacles, but more surprisingly their spatial disorder, causes a drastic shift from a collective to a single-cell mode of invasion. Combining live-imaging and perturbation experiments with minimal biophysical modeling, we demonstrate that cellular detachments result both from local geometrical constraints and a global temporal integration of the heterogeneity experienced during the invasion process. We show that different types of microenvironments map onto different universality classes of invasion dynamics, which can quantitatively explain our findings. We thus identify generic physical principles for how the mode of cancer cell invasion depends on environmental heterogeneity, with implications to understand tumor evolution in vivo.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Reports to date have focused primarily on analyzing the drug-induced evolution of lung cancer cells in in vitro preclinical models with limited complexity and a relative lack of characterization of actionable biological programs to induce durable responses. Here, we challenged this paradigm and employed a lineage tracing single-cell RNAseq method to track the evolution of primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and tumor xenografts in response to the standard-of-care EGFR inhibitor osimertinib, with a focus on understanding drug persistence and resistance. Our single-cell lineage tracing-RNAseq system revealed the presence of a discrete set of lineages with distinct transcriptional phenotypes over the course of the treatment. We identified two lineage populations that became predominant during drug treatment and resisted therapy in the PDOs and tumor xenografts. These lineages were present before treatment and harbored Hedgehog pathway and FOXD1 transcriptional programs, respectively. These specific transcriptomic lineages were otherwise undetectable by lower-resolution profiling. Functional studies confirmed the protective role that the baseline expression of the Hedgehog pathway and FOXD1 programs in the lineage tumor cell sub-populations exerts upon targeted therapy. The potential clinical relevance of these regulatory programs was validated by cross- analysis of single-cell transcriptomic data obtained from human NSCLC specimens. Overall, our approach identified pre-existing seeds of resistance before therapy and convergent, adaptive mechanisms supporting tumor residual disease and resistant states. This study highlights the utility of high-resolution tracing of tumor clonal heterogeneity with matched single-cell profiling to reveal occult cell states and molecular mechanisms of therapy resistance and develop counteracting strategies.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Despite its economic impact, understanding of the molecular interactions between Z. tritici and its host remains limited, particularly the functions of many uncharacterized candidate effectors. To explore the roles of candidate effectors in modulating host immune responses, we selected seven Z. tritici genes with elevated expression during the early biotrophic phase and the transition to necrotrophy in a susceptible interaction. These candidates were transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana, both with and without their predicted signal peptides. AlphaFold structural predictions revealed that two candidates share similarity with proteins of known function: a sterol-binding protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a necrosis-inducing effector from Valsa mali. Effector activity did not always correlate with expression timing, and the presence of a signal peptide significantly influenced the activity of candidate effectors on host defense responses. Several effectors consistently attenuate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while none suppress PBR1-mediated cell death, indicating they do not target this NLR or its downstream signaling. Two candidate effectors, Mycgr3107904 and Mycgr394290, induce cell death in N. benthamiana while also modulating the ROS burst, suggesting potential dual functions at different stages of infection. These findings provide new insights into how Z. tritici effectors modulate plant immunity during disease progression, either to evade host recognition or establish infection.

However, a comprehensive multimodal characterization and understanding of the transcriptional programs driving these transitions remain incomplete. Methods: To comprehensively define the phenotypic diversity of VSMCs during atherosclerosis progression, we performed in-depth profiling using cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing in a VSMC lineage-tracing atherosclerotic mouse model. Insights from these datasets guided the design of targeted in vitro experiments to investigate candidate regulatory mechanisms. Results: Single-cell multi-omics revealed extensive cellular heterogeneity within atherosclerotic plaques, including a rare population of VSMC-derived macrophage-like cells, whose presence was confirmed by histological analysis. These studies also identified a substantial population of VSMC-derived foam cells, comprising approximately 70% of all foam cells in the lesions. These cells exhibited activation of gene programs associated with lipid metabolism, proliferation, and tumor-like features. The transcription factor Bhlhe40 emerged as a key regulator of this phenotypic transition, with elevated expression in VSMC-derived foam cells during disease progression. Functional knockdown of Bhlhe40 suppressed VSMC phenotypic switching and foam cell characteristics, underscoring its potential role as a driver of VSMC modulation. Conclusions: These findings advance our understanding of VSMC phenotypic modulation in atherosclerosis and highlight Bhlhe40 as a key regulator of this process. Elucidating the mechanisms governing VSMC plasticity may offer new therapeutic opportunities to reduce cardiovascular risk by targeting disease-driving cellular transitions.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Culex tarsalis is a widely distributed mosquito species in North America and is an important vector of West Nile virus (WNV). Previous studies have shown that co-infection with insect-specific viruses (ISVs) can modulate WNV replication in Cx. tarsalis, highlighting the importance of characterizing the virome of this species. Here, we investigated the virome of Cx. tarsalis populations across 5 states of the Midwestern United States using sRNA-seq. We analyzed samples from 17 geographic locations which were collected under suboptimal field conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, presenting challenges related to sample integrity. Despite these challenges, sRNA-seq proved to be a reliable method for virome analysis. We identified seven viruses associated with Cx. tarsalis, along with their respective sRNA (siRNA and piRNA) profiles.

To assess whether white-tailed deer continued to be infected with B.1.641 and to test for spillover into other species, we established a surveillance program in Ontario by sampling wildlife via existing monitoring programs and through active surveillance of captive and wild animals. Between 2022 to 2024, we tested 2,839 animals, identifying one active SARS-CoV-2 infection (a likely spillover of a recombinant XBB.2.3.11.3 lineage), but no cases of B.1.641. Overall, 93 animals (6.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, including 89 white-tailed deer, two Virginia opossums (Didelphis virginiana), one American mink (Neogale vison), and one river otter (Lontra canadensis). In Southwestern Ontario, where B.1.641 was originally detected, 15.2% of deer samples were seropositive. Generalized Linear Models demonstrated that seropositive deer were more likely to be found in areas with a higher fall deer harvest and human population density, and closer to previous B.1.641 cases.

Being able to identify and improve the management of those who may be at risk requires robust screening methods. The use of circulating molecular markers provides a promising and non-invasive solution to this problem to allow necessary and successful intervention. The role of inflammation has been continuously demonstrated to play a key role in the onset of sPTB with intrauterine inflammation being a key driver. Here we sought out to explore the inflammatory proteome using a nested case-control approach using samples from pregnant participants in the INSIGHT cohort. Objectives To explore the maternal blood proteome in the second trimester using the Olink Explore panel to identify inflammatory proteins associated with sPTB and assess their predictive value, both independently and in combination with cell-free RNA (cfRNA). Study Design We conducted a nested case-control study to investigate inflammatory protein profiles during the second trimester of pregnancy. A total of 138 maternal blood plasma samples were analyzed using a targeted proteomic assay quantifying 384 inflammation-related proteins. Differential expression analysis and a LASSO-logistic regression model with Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) were applied to evaluate the association between inflammatory biomarkers and spontaneous preterm birth (sPTB) outcomes. Results Using predictive modelling of the maternal blood proteome, 16 inflammation-related proteins were identified as key discriminators of sPTB risk, with proteins such as PGF, COL9A1, CST7, CXCL6 and GALNT3 emerging as major contributors for predicting sPTB risk. Using inflammation-related maternal proteins alone to predict sPTB (<35 weeks) achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.66-0.84). The incorporation of both cfRNA and proteomic data into an integrated model, improved the area under the curve to 0.85 (95% CI: 0.78-0.92). The integrated model highlighted inflammatory biomarkers that are not only implicated in preterm birth but also in essential physiological mechanisms such as placental function, tissue remodelling, and extracellular matrix composition, which are critical to maintaining pregnancy and preventing premature labour. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that an integrated approach using both cfRNA and proteomic signatures of the second trimester maternal blood plasma yields a more comprehensive biomarker profile for predicting preterm birth risk. This multimodal strategy not only enhances the predictive accuracy but also captures a broader array of biological signals across multiple organ systems. Compared to relying solely on inflammatory proteome markers, this multiomic method offers a deeper molecular characterisation of preterm birth risk in the maternal blood plasma.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

E.; Ruan, X.", "abstract": "RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play essential roles in all major steps of RNA processing. Genetic studies in human and mouse models support that many RBPs are crucial for maintaining homeostasis in key tissues/organs, but to what extent the function of RBPs is conserved between humans and mice is not clear. Our recent study using a chimeric humanized liver mouse model found that knocking down human HuR in human hepatocytes resulted in a broad upregulation of human genes involved in fatty acid catabolism. This regulation is human-specific, as the knocking down of mouse HuR in the liver of traditional mouse models did not show these effects. To further study this human-specific role of HuR, we co-overexpressed HuR with PPAR, a master transcription factor that promotes fatty acid catabolism, in cultured cells. We found that HuR suppressed the expression of PPAR induced fatty acid catabolism genes in human cells but not in mouse cells. We provide evidence supporting that the human-specific suppressive effect of HuR is independent of PPAR expression or location. The regulatory effects of HuR are also independent of its role in regulating mRNA stability. Using the human HMGCS2 gene as an example, we found that the suppressive effect of HuR cannot be explained by decreased promoter activity. We further provide evidence supporting that HuR suppresses the pre-mRNA processing of HMGCS2 gene, leading to accumulated intron/pre-mRNA expression of HMGCS2 gene. Furthermore, overexpression of HuR blocked and knocking down of HuR sensitized PPAR agonist-induced gene expression. By analyzing published RNA-seq data, we found compromised pre-mRNA processing for fatty acid catabolism genes in patients with fatty liver diseases, which was not observed in mouse fatty liver disease models. Our study supports the model that HuR suppresses the expression of fatty acid catabolism genes by blocking their pre-mRNA processing, which may partially explain the mild effects of PPAR agonists in treating fatty liver diseases in humans as compared with studies in mice.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

The analysis of these two genetic markers frequently discloses discordant patterns (mito-nuclear discordance) that can arise simply as a consequence of their different effective population sizes (Ne). Species-specific sex-biased dispersal may contribute to the mito-nuclear discordance observed in natural populations. However, the relative contribution of genetic drift versus sex-biased dispersal in driving mito-nuclear discordance remains insufficiently evaluated. Here, we use forward genetic simulations to address this knowledge gap. Our findings support the baseline level of mito-nuclear discordance arising from distinct genomic Ne, but show that this inherent discordance is magnified by sex-biased dispersal patterns. We demonstrate that female-biased dispersal leads to a marked spatial mismatch between mitochondrial and nuclear diversity across the simulated populations, thereby reducing the spatial concordance between mitochondrial and nuclear markers. Conversely, male dispersal patterns appear to increase, although to a reduced degree, the intrinsic level of discordance between nuclear and mitochondrial geographical marker distribution.

Ongoing studies aim to understand their functions in order to evaluate their potential as anti-cancer therapeutic targets. Evidence suggests the existence of subcategories of CG genes, depending on location on autosomal or sex chromosomes, reliance on DNA methylation for transcriptional regulation, and profile of expression during gametogenesis and early embryogenesis. To clarify this issue, we developed CTexploreR, a R/Bioconductor package that integrates an up-to-date reference list of human CG genes (n=146) with multiple bulk and single-cell methylomic and transcriptomic datasets. Based on promoter methylation profiles and responsiveness to a DNA methylation inhibitor, 74% of the CG genes were classified as DNA methylation dependent (Methdep). Intriguingly, most X-linked CG genes (69/70) fell into this category, thereby implicating DNA methylation dependency in the well-documented over-representation of testis-specific genes on the X chromosome. We further observed that, whereas X-linked Methdep CG genes become demethylated and activated in pre-spermatogonia in the fetal testis, most of them resist DNA demethylation in female germ cells and remain therefore silent in fetal and adult oocytes. Importantly, a number of X-linked Methdep CG genes (e.g. FMRN1B, GAGE2A, MAGEB2/C2, PAGE2, VCX3A/B) maintained this maternal-specific imprinting after fertilization, and were expressed exclusively in female preimplantation embryos, which inherit a paternal X chromosome.

The Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus vaccine plasmid pWRG/VEEV, encoding the glycoprotein (E)3, E2, 6K and E1 genes was used as the prototype for this process development. The current effort yielded >95% pure and >80% supercoiled pWRG/VEEV plasmid preparations at 50-g wet cell weight scale. These data showed feasibility of manufacturing, highly pure pWRG/VEEV plasmid DNA using a cGMP compliant manufacturing process.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

It is an integral membrane protein with twelve transmembrane -helices that complicates studies with the full-length ABCA4 transporter. We have engineered the full-length ABCA4 by transforming its membrane helices, creating a soluble homolog (ABCA4s). Most hydrophobic residues in the membrane helices were substituted with structurally compatible but hydrophilic residues. The re-engineered ABCA4s was expressed in insect cells, and it was found in the cytosolic extract, which was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography.

In this study, we investigated how diabetic conditions affect endothelial barrier integrity and identified the molecular mechanisms contributing to this dysfunction. Using a 3D microfluidic model that recapitulates in vivo vascular architecture and flow, we demonstrated that high glucose (HG) and high fat (HF) conditions significantly impair endothelial barrier function, as demonstrated by increased dextran permeability and loss of VE-cadherin from the cellular membrane site. Metabolomic profiling and functional assays revealed a shift toward glycolysis, marked by elevated lactate levels and upregulation of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), which contributed to barrier disruption. Pharmacological inhibition of LDHA effectively restored barrier function, underscoring the pathogenic role of glycolytic reprogramming. Transcriptomic analyses of mouse and human DKD datasets further identified connexin 43 (Cx43) as a candidate mediator of this dysfunction. Cx43 expression was progressively regulated in diabetic mouse kidneys and across multiple cell types in human DKD samples. In vitro, Cx43 overexpression in endothelial cells enhanced glycolytic flux, suppressed oxidative metabolism, disrupted VE-cadherin localization, and promoted angiogenic sprouting. Collectively, our findings establish a mechanistic link between Cx43-driven metabolic reprogramming and endothelial barrier dysfunction in DKD, highlighting Cx43 as a potential therapeutic target for preserving vascular integrity in diabetic conditions.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

When the bacteria Acetobacter aceti were introduced into a mixture of ethanol and limestone powder, the pH came down rapidly, and dissolution of limestone into calcium acetate was observed. After the ethanol was fully consumed, pH rose gradually, and calcium carbonate crystals were reprecipitated. All the reaction rates have been determined, and the products have been characterised.

Expanding this space to include noncanonical amino acids (NCAAs) offers new opportunities for probing novel interactions and engineering proteins with enhanced or entirely new functions. Some NCAAs also offer practical advantages, such as increased proteolytic stability and reduced immunogenicity, as they are rarely encountered by the human immune system. Here, we present RareFold, a deep learning model capable of accurate structure prediction for proteins containing both the 20 canonical amino acids and an additional 29 NCAAs. By treating each amino acid as a distinct token, RareFold learns residue-specific atomic interaction patterns, enabling precise modelling of chemically diverse sequences. This tokenised representation also supports sequence-structure co-optimisation, allowing efficient inverse design. We leverage this capability in EvoBindRare, a design framework for generating linear and cyclic peptide binders that incorporate NCAAs. Applying EvoBindRare, we design binders targeting a ribonuclease and experimentally validate these, obtaining M affinity in both the linear and cyclic cases. RareFold thus enables binder design with an expanded chemical vocabulary, opening the door to next-generation peptide therapeutics with improved stability, specificity, and immune evasion.

We began by computing interaction scores between extensive libraries of drugs/compounds and proteins to generate \"interaction signatures\" that model compound behavior on a proteomic scale. Compounds with signatures most similar to those of drugs approved for a given indication were considered potential treatments. These compounds were further ranked by degree of consensus in corresponding similarity lists. We benchmarked performance by measuring the recovery of approved drugs in these similarity and consensus lists at various cutoffs, using multiple metrics and comparing results to random controls and performance across all indications. Compounds ranked highly by consensus but not previously associated with the indication of interest were considered new predictions. Our benchmarking results showed that CANDO improved accuracy in identifying glioma-associated drugs across all cutoffs compared to random controls. Our predictions, supported by literature-based analysis, identified 23 potential glioma treatments, including approved drugs like vitamin D, taxanes, vinca alkaloids, topoisomerase inhibitors, and folic acid, as well as investigational compounds such as ginsenosides, chrysin, resiniferatoxin, and cryptotanshinone. Further functional annotation-based analysis of the top targets with the strongest interactions to these predictions identified vitamin D3 receptor, thyroid hormone receptor, acetylcholinesterase, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, tubulin alpha chain, dihydrofolate reductase, and thymidylate synthase.

This approach yielded sinonasal malignancies with diverse histologies, including sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated sinonasal carcinoma, and sinonasal neuroendocrine tumors characteristic of olfactory neuroblastoma. Surprisingly, rather than observing distinct sgRNA profiles across sinonasal tumor subtypes, common recurrent mutations were identified in Nf1 (79%), Rasa1 (74%), and Trp53 (68%) across malignancies with distinct histologies. Utilizing an orthogonal approach, we confirmed that Nf1/Trp53 were required for sinonasal tumorigenesis. Given that loss-of-function in NF1 and RASA1 may lead to increased Ras activity and downstream MEK signaling, we tested small molecule targeting of the RAS-MAPK pathway in sinonasal malignancies. Indeed, both tumor cell lines derived from our loss-of-function approach as well as from human sinonasal malignancies displayed significant sensitivity to MEK inhibition in standard in vitro culture and organoid models.

We investigated whether pharmacologically inducing autophagy could alter the senescent phenotype and help ameliorate AD pathology. We discovered that Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC), a natural compound found in Curcuma longa, stimulates autophagy in primary astrocytes. We found that autophagy and senescence exhibit an inverse relationship in aging astrocytes, with increased expression of senescent proteins and downregulation of autophagic proteins. However, treatment of aged astrocytes with BDMC reversed the senescent phenotype by ameliorating the impaired autophagy. Interestingly, the senescent phenotype persisted when autophagy was downregulated by knockdown of AMPK. Additionally, BDMC-induced autophagy aided in the removal of amyloid beta that was administered externally to the astrocytes. Further, to validate these results in a mouse model of AD, we confirmed that BDMC can significantly penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in mice. Therefore, we administered 50 and 100 mg/kg b.w. of BDMC to transgenic 3xTg-AD mice for two months. In their hippocampus, the Control 3xTg-AD animals showed more senescent cells and lower autophagy levels. In contrast, autophagic proteins were significantly upregulated while senescence indicators, such as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) proteins, were sharply downregulated in the brain of treated animals. Additionally, we discovered that the treated mice's hippocampus had a significantly lower amyloid beta load.

To address this question, we studied the effect of domain insertion on the function of NADPH-dependent sulfite reductase (SiR) from Escherichia coli, a dodecameric protein containing eight hemoprotein subunits and four flavoprotein subunits. SiR mutational tolerance was first mapped using systematic peptide insertion, and a subset of variants retaining activity were subjected to domain insertion. When a ligand-binding domain was inserted at locations tolerant to peptide insertion, including sites proximal and distal from the intersubunit interfaces, more than half of the resulting variants presented cellular activity that is enhanced by an endocrine disruptor.

We investigated the role of PKC{delta} in macrophages using a macrophage-specific PKC{delta} knockout mice model (LysMcrePKC{delta}flox/flox). PKC{delta} deficiency in macrophages triggers an early lymphocytic immune response, increases neutrophil recruitment, and reduces inflammatory macrophages in the lungs, leading to higher Mtb burden and exacerbated pathology. Experimental and omics analysis further revealed that dysregulation of antimicrobial effector functions is detrimental to macrophage's ability to restrict bacterial growth in vitro. Importantly this defect was mitigated by exogenous GM-CSF supplementation and/or overexpressing PKC{delta} in macrophages.

Here, we uncover a pivotal role of minor temperature shifts in transition of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) from commensal to virulent lifestyles, mediated via an RNA thermosensing (RNAT) element within the untranslated region of the global regulator CiaR. By positively regulating the expression of the surface adhesin, Phosphorylcholine (PCho), in response to elevated temperature, CiaR potentiates pneumococcal infection. Engineering the RNAT structure to create translation restrictive or permissive versions allowed us to demonstrate how modulation in expression of CiaR could alter pneumococcal invasion capability, influencing infection outcomes. Moreover, intranasal administration of PCho mitigated SPN-induced bacteraemic pneumonia.

However, a global understanding of TE dynamics driving effector evolution at population scale and across lineages is lacking. Here, we focus on 16 AVR effector loci assessed across a global sampling of 11 reference genomes and 447 newly generated draft genome assemblies across all major M. oryzae lineages and outgroups. We classified each effector based on evidence for duplication, deletion and translocation processes among lineages.

Each AVR was integrated in a distinct genomic niche determined by the TE activity profile contributing to the diversification at the locus. We quantified TE contributions to effector niches and found that TE identity helped diversify AVR loci. We used the large genomic dataset to recapitulate the evolution of the rice blast AVR1-CO39 locus.

While MMEJ has been detected in normal tissues, its presence is puzzling given its error-prone nature, and its physiological role remains poorly defined. Recent studies implicating MMEJ in mitosis suggest a potential function in normal proliferative cells. Here, we show that MMEJ is not uniformly active across tissues but is selectively enriched in proliferative tissues, including thymus, spleen, testes, and liver, while markedly reduced in post-mitotic tissues such as brain, heart, kidney, and lung. This differential activity is supported by tissue-specific expression of key MMEJ components (e.g., Ligase III, MRE11, XRCC1, PARP1, Pol {theta}) and inhibitory factors (e.g., WRN, RAD51, ATM). Moreover, proliferative tissues preferentially utilize short microhomologies (~10 nt), whereas post-mitotic tissues rely on longer microhomologies ([&ge;]13 nt), indicating a shift in repair pathway choice. These findings reveal that MMEJ is a tightly regulated, context-dependent repair pathway. Its activity is tolerated in proliferative tissues due to ongoing cell turnover, while its suppression in long-lived, post-mitotic cells is likely essential to preserve genomic stability. This study assigns a physiological role to MMEJ in healthy tissue homeostasis and highlights its relevance for designing targeted DNA repair-based therapeutic strategies across diverse tissue types.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Thus, quantifying the extent and location of proposed mining operations is key to mitigating the impacts on threatened species.

The Philippine Eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi), a critically endangered tropical forest raptor endemic to the Philippines, faces increasing threats from mining activities that destroy and fragment its tropical forest habitat. Here, we integrate Species Distribution Modelling with gap and hotspot analysis to assess the spatial overlap between Philippine Eagle nest habitat and mining concessions across a protected area network on Mindanao, where the largest population remains. Using a landscape-scale SDM built with remote sensing covariates and eagle occurrence data, we identified high-suitability nest habitats and projected these into the Eastern Mindanao Biodiversity Corridor (EMBC). Hotspot analysis revealed that 41 % of the total mining concessions area contained high-suitability nest habitat, highlighting significant conservation risks. Additionally, 46 % of indigenous ancestral domains contain high-suitability nest habitat, emphasizing the importance of indigenous land management in safeguarding eagle habitats. Our gap analysis demonstrated that 35 % of the EMBC protects high-suitability nest habitat, which here represents the remaining montane tropical forest. To mitigate mining impacts, we propose targeted nest surveys in high-risk areas, implementation of mining moratoriums near critical nesting zones, and strengthening indigenous and protected area land management.

In this work we show using in vitro and in vivo approaches, that the CHAP domain of PcsB predominately functions as an iso-D-Glutaminyl-Lysyl D,L-endopeptidase, with particular substrate specificity for Lys-containing, amidated PG, cleaving between the second and third amino acids of the peptidoglycan stem peptide. The catalytic activity of PcsB is regulated and activated by conformation changes of the coiled-coil region of PcsB and in part by a short helical region immediately adjacent to the CHAP domain to guard against PcsB hydrolytic activation outside of its cell division specific functional requirement. This work supports a model for the overall biological activity of the FtsEX-PcsB complex, in which ATP hydrolysis by FtsE in the cytoplasm, drives conformational changes in FtsX and PcsB resulting in the liberation of the hydrolytic CHAP domain of PcsB from its regulatory helix to allow PG stem peptide cleavage that splits the septal disk and marks a region of the peptidoglycan sacculus for subsequent cell division remodelling.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a novel approach based on molecular dynamics simulations that utilizes statistical thermodynamic signatures of water at protein interfaces to improve the accuracy of water placement in cryo-EM maps, with apoferritin as a model benchmark system. The interaction energy of solvent with the protein is insufficient to distinguish between high- and lower-consensus water positions, consistent with reports of earlier work. Instead, we employ a detailed statistical thermodynamic analysis based on the excess chemical potential (WT) - a measure of the thermodynamic balance between the interaction energy of an interfacial water molecule with the protein and its free energy of interaction with all of the other solvent molecules. WT is proportional to the log ratio of the local density of water molecules at the protein interface to the bulk density. 85% of the top 100 water locations with the most favorable excess chemical potential values are observed in one or more high resolution Cryo-EM maps deposited in the PDB, and 70% of the top 200 water locations indexed by excess chemical potential are observed in the cryo-EM maps.

Investigating the development process is vital for uncovering the formation of complex biological systems.

Although spatial transcriptomics provides spatial context for gene expression, existing algorithms focus mainly on identifying spatial regions without further exploring their developmental connections. In this study, we propose an algorithm for detecting spatial-temporal domains in tissue to trace developmental path (stTrace) using spatial transcriptomics. stTrace integrates the degree of cell development, gene expression, and spatial location to identify \"spatial-temporal domains\", regions where cells share similar functions and developmental stages within the tissue. Moreover, hierarchical relationships exist among these regions, reflecting developmental connections between cells in the tissue. Our experiments on mouse embryo and human breast cancer data revealed that stTrace can detect more refined regions than traditional spatial domain identification algorithms. Furthermore, the directions of developmental paths inferred from hierarchical relationships are consistent with the dynamic trajectories derived from single-cell velocity.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce EYKTHYR, a computational framework that integrates gene expression and chromatin accessibility within a spatially aware model to identify TFs driving spatial gene programs. EYKTHYR mitigates dropout effects by leveraging interpretable, low-dimensional embeddings of gene expression and chromatin accessibility -- both linear with respect to their input -- enabling robust identification and scalable inference of spatial transcriptional regulators. Applied across diverse spatial multiome datasets, EYKTHYR consistently outperforms existing approaches, accurately identifying TFs that coordinate spatial gene programs in mouse brain development and regulate T-cell states within tumor microenvironments.

While these databases provide more observations, they often do not have observations that match the system of interest exactly. Here, we investigate what information can be gleaned from these general databases in the context of modeling a specific system - cell signaling. Ultimately, our goal is to better determine models of specific systems, thereby increasing their utility. We use this framework to integrate measurements from the protein data bank (PDB) and UniProt (FASTA) and to quantify what information is gained from these measurements when modeling cell signaling. We choose to investigate the utility of these databases in the context of dynamic cell signaling models because experimental measurements of the variables of interest (protein dynamics) are still quite limited. We find that we can successfully integrate measurements from these databases to improve parameter estimation of the cell signaling models. The impact of the database-derived measurements on model predictions depends on the complex relationship between model prediction and parameter values.

The larvae of anopheles were collected from October 2022 to April 2023 using dipping method, and reared to adult stage. The An. gambiae were exposed to alphacypermethrin 0.05% (Acyp_1X), permethrin 0.75% (Perm_1X), and deltamethrin 0.05% (Delth_1X) then tested using WHO bioassay standard protocol for insecticide resistance monitoring. As results, we found an extremely high resistance to permethrin in Gashora (Bugesera district), Mubuga (Karongi district), Rwaza (Musanze district), Kirarambogo (Gisagara district) with mortality rate of 42%, 48%, 69% and 70% repsectively.

A3 is exclusive to this lineage, having emerged after the divergence from marsupials. This raises the question of how marsupials, which lack A3, defend against retroviruses. An uncharacterized A3 homologue, APOBEC5 (A5), is present in marsupial genomes and in some other vertebrate taxa. Here, we use in silico and in vitro approaches to investigate whether A5 serves as a functional antiviral counterpart to A3 in marsupials and whether marsupial genomes contain evidence of past A3-like activity against retroviral infections. We find that A5 was present in the last common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates but has been lost independently in multiple lineages. A5 exhibits unique structural and post-translational features not observed in APOBEC3 or other APOBEC proteins and has a broad subcellular and tissue distribution, suggesting a multifunctional role. Mutagenesis assays demonstrate that A5 functions as a DNA mutator and modestly restricts the infectivity of a model retrovirus, HIV-1, and that this activity is counteracted by the HIV-1 protein, Vif. Furthermore, analysis of the gray short-tailed opossum genome reveals distinct patterns of A3-like restriction in two groups of recently integrated retroviruses, providing direct evidence of an ongoing evolutionary conflict between marsupial APOBEC proteins and retroviruses. This study presents the first characterisation of A5 as a novel AID/APOBEC family member and reveals that marsupials possess an antiviral function homologous to placental A3, shedding light on the evolutionary dynamics of vertebrate antiviral immunity.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Modeling analyses of circadian-controlled immune responses to three vaccine types demonstrate that vaccine-specific differences in time-of-day-dependent immunity originate from distinctions in the circadian-regulated activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. This divergence is amplified by bistability in the dendritic cell homing process, resulting in long-term distinctions in adaptive immunity across vaccine types.

This study aimed to characterise differences in resting-state brain signal complexity between individuals with ASD and neurotypical controls using multiscale entropy (MSE). Methods: Resting-state fMRI data were obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I), a large multi-site dataset including 397 participants (179 with ASC, 218 neurotypical controls; ASD: Mean age 16.43 years old, SD 7.17 years old; CON: Mean age 15.75 years old, SD 5.67 years old). Voxel-wise multiscale entropy (MSE) features were extracted across multiple temporal scales. Group comparisons were conducted using voxel-wise t-tests and mixed-effects models to identify region- and scale-specific alterations in brain signal complexity. Results: Individuals with ASD showed reduced MSE in prefrontal regions at coarser time scales and elevated MSE in posterior midline regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, at finer scales, followed by a decline across coarser scales. This pattern suggests a shift toward uncorrelated randomness in posterior regions and reduced long-range complexity in frontal areas. No significant associations were found between MSE features and ADOS scores.

Although often co-occurring with other psychological and neurodevelopmental conditions such as anxiety, depression and autism spectrum disorders, alexithymia is believed to be associated with unique alterations within the socio-emotional brain networks. With the semantic and neuromodulatory brainstem systems playing a key role in social and affective cognition, the current work aimed to study their contributions to alexithymia in unprecedented detail. First, we attempted to identify resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the social semantic hubs (superior anterior temporal lobe) and monoamine-producing regions (dorsal raphe, ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus) linked to each alexithymia domain. Secondly, by deploying tractography and graph analysis of the associated structural network, we intended to identify their potential anatomical correlates. Alexithymia was strongly associated with dysconnectivity within the semantic network, and altered functional connectivity between the neuromodulatory brainstem regions and cortical areas crucial for social cognition and emotion regulation, including medial prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule. On the anatomical level, these findings were paralleled by negative links with network modularity, suggestive of less specialised neural processing, and decreased clustering coefficient of the semantic node in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Despite observing associations with trait-anxiety and emotion suppression for some of the highlighted findings, these phenomena did not mediate the effects of alexithymia. Therefore, the current work highlights the existence of functional and structural alterations within socio-emotional networks as neural markers of alexithymia.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

In addition to their aggregation defect, activated platelets lacking RAP1 (Rap1mKO) exhibited a marked impairment in surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), a negatively charged phospholipid with procoagulant activity. However, the mechanisms by which RAP1 regulates PtdSer exposure are unclear. Here we investigated the hypothesis that RAP1 regulates platelet PtdSer exposure through cross-talk with small GTPases of the Rho family. Consistent with their defect in PtdSer exposure, Rap1mKO platelets showed reduced procoagulant activity in vitro and in vivo when compared to controls. Stimulated Rap1mKO platelets exhibited elevated RHOA-GTP levels, and inhibition of the RHOA effector, Rho associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK), partially restored PtdSer exposure in these cells. A milder defect in PtdSer exposure was observed for platelets from Tln-1mR35/118E mice, i.e. mice with impaired RAP1-Tln-1 interaction but otherwise intact RAP1 signaling. ROCK inhibition fully restored PtdSer exposure in Tln-1mR35/118E platelets. Opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, a cellular response critical to PtdSer exposure, was impaired in Rap1mKO platelets and restored by pretreatment of cells with the ROCK inhibitor.

By storing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the form of neutral lipids, LDs can either mitigate or exacerbate lipotoxic damage. However, the role of LDs in regulating cellular fatty acid distribution, membrane unsaturation and ferroptosis susceptibility remains poorly understood. Here, we show that inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT)-mediated LD biogenesis in PUFA-supplemented triple-negative breast cancer cells induces widespread lipidome rearrangements and membrane phospholipid acyl-chain remodelling, promoting lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis sensitivity. Lipidomic analyses reveal that LDs efficiently sequester exogenous PUFAs within triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters, significantly altering the unsaturation profiles of these neutral lipids. When LD formation is impaired by DGAT inhibition, PUFAs are redistributed into membrane ester and ether glycerophospholipids, enhancing overall membrane unsaturation, lipid peroxidation, and increasing ferroptosis susceptibility, even in the absence of additional ferroptosis inducers. In contrast, in ferroptosis- and PUFA-resistant lung cancer cells, LDs exhibit a dual role, whereby the mode of ferroptosis induction and PUFA loading determined whether DGAT inhibition promoted or protected against ferroptosis. The pro-ferroptotic function of LDs predominates in these cells, particularly under conditions of ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) deficiency.

These findings led us to hypothesize that modifying MT5-MMP C-terminal domains could serve as an effective strategy to modulate C99 and A{beta}. To test this, here we generated MT5-MMP variants carrying amino acid deletions or substitutions in entire proteinase domains or in selected amino acid clusters in the IC domain. MT5-MMP variants were co-transfected into human cell lines accumulating C99, reminiscent of an AD setting. We identified mutations in the IC domain that induce C99 degradation and a decrease in A{beta} levels, while other mutations have divergent effects on these APP metabolites. Furthermore, high content imaging revealed the importance of MT5-MMP IC modifications in regulating subcellular trafficking of C99 through the endomembrane system and its consequences for C99 processing. Proximity ligation assays also highlighted the importance of the IC domain in MT5-MMP colocalization and potential interaction with C99. In a translational effort, we synthetized and functionalized peptides that mimic the MT5-MMP IC domain and carry mutations that reduce C99 and/or A{beta} levels. One of these peptides reduced C99 levels in an in vitro AD model. Overall, our study highlights the role of selected amino acids in the C-terminal domains of MT5-MMP as the basis for a better understanding of the proteinase's contribution to C99 and A{beta} metabolism. Furthermore, this study provides new insights for designing MT5-MMP-based strategies against AD, exploiting the unique properties of specific mutations in MT5-MMP domains to prevent the accumulation of C99 and A{beta}.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

In stem cells, autophagy is essential for the decision between quiescence, self-renewal and differentiation. We observed that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and thereof derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have a functional autophagy machinery, as shown by starvation-induced autophagic flux and ULK1 activation. Using the human iPSC line iPS11 and thereof derived NPCs (niPS11), we investigated whether genotoxic stress induced by benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide (BPDE) or etoposide can similarly activate autophagy, as previously reported for cancer cell lines. While both BPDE and etoposide induced the DNA damage markers phospho-p53 Ser15 and {gamma}H2AX and slightly altered the expression of DNA repair proteins such as XPC, they did not trigger autophagic flux in either iPSCs or NPCs. After genotoxin treatment, ULK1 activation was only observed in NPCs, but this was not sufficient to trigger a significant downstream autophagic response. Mass spectrometry revealed minimal proteomic changes in iPSCs and moderate changes in NPCs, mainly involving mitotic regulators. These results suggest that genotoxic agents do not strongly affect canonical autophagy in pluripotent stem cells or their neural derivatives despite an otherwise responsive autophagic system.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

T.; Perez, A. M.; Zhang, Y.; Vest, K.", "abstract": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset disease caused by modest alanine expansion at the amino terminus of the nuclear polyadenosine RNA binding protein PABPN1. PABPN1 is expressed ubiquitously and is involved in multiple steps in RNA processing including optimal cleavage and polyadenylation, polyadenylation signal selection, and export of polyadenylated RNAs from the nucleus. Expanded PABPN1 forms aggregates in a subset of muscle nuclei, but PABPN1 levels are paradoxically low in muscle compared to other tissues. Despite several studies in model systems and patient tissues, it remains unclear whether alanine expansion directly impairs PABPN1 function. The molecular mechanisms leading to OPMD pathology are poorly understood. Here we used a proximity labeling approach to better understand the effect of alanine expansion on PABPN1 function in a cell culture model of skeletal muscle. To avoid the confounding factor of overexpression, PABPN1 constructs containing a carboxy-terminal TurboID tag were expressed in skeletal myotubes at near native levels using an inducible promoter. Although non-expanded PABPN1-TurboID was able to complement RNA export and myoblast differentiation defects caused by deficiency of endogenous PABPN1, alanine expanded PABPN1-TurboID was not. Comparative proteomics revealed increased interaction between expanded PABPN1 and RNA splicing and polyadenylation machinery and follow-up studies identified a dominant negative effect on RNA export in differentiated myotubes. These data indicate that alanine expansion can impair PABPN1 function regardless of the presence of wild type PABPN1 and support a model wherein both loss function and dominant negative effects of expanded PABPN1 contribute to OPMD pathology.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Objectives: This study investigated how telomere dysfunction in AT2 cells lacking Telomere Repeat Binding Factor 1 (TRF1) drives lung remodeling in SPC-creTRF1flox/flox mice and its relevance to IPF. Methods: Mouse model of telomere dysfunction was used to conditionally delete TRF1 in AT2 cells. SPC-creTRF1flox/flox mouse lung epithelial cells were used to perform single cell RNA sequencing. AT2 cells from IPF lungs were analyzed by single cell RNA sequencing in an organoid model. Measurements and Main Results: Single cell RNA-sequencing revealed distinct pathological AT2 cells enriched in DNA damage, senescence, oxidative stress, and pro-fibrotic genes, along with fewer normal AT2 cells and increased club cells in SPC-creTRF1flox/flox mice. Pathological AT2 cells showed different early and late-stage gene signatures, with a prominent p53 signature at both time-points. Genetic deletion of p53 in SPC-creTRF1flox/flox AT2 cells improved survival and prevented lung fibrosis. p53 deletion or inhibition improved organoid formation, surfactant protein C expression, and reduced pro-fibrotic gene expression in AT2 cells isolated from SPC-creTRF1flox/flox mice or IPF lungs. Conclusions: These data suggest that the DNA damage response to AT2 cell telomere dysfunction, driven by enhanced p53 activity, mediates early AT2 cell transdifferentiation and senescence, leading to epithelial cell remodeling and fibrosis and that reversing this reprogramming is a potential therapeutic approach for managing IPF.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

To gain insights into the structural and evolutionary characteristics of these networks, we analyzed gene interaction networks across 4756 human polygenic phenotypes, contrasting the network properties of genes associated with polygenic phenotypes against those of non-associated genes. Our results indicate that genes associated with polygenic phenotypes exhibit a significantly higher connectivity in their corresponding gene-interaction networks, with connectivity varying markedly across different trait domains. Notably, genes within highly connected networks are enriched for immune-related biological processes, whereas genes in less connected networks are more involved in neurogenesis. Furthermore, we found that genes embedded in highly connected networks are, on average, under weaker selective constraints than those in lowly connected networks. Overall, our findings provide a systematic analysis of gene interaction networks underlying human polygenic traits and reveal how selective constraints vary with network connectivity. These insights offer a framework for prioritizing genes based on their connectivity within trait-associated networks.

As a critical component of social communication, this skill enables individuals to interpret others emotions and intentions. However, the brain mechanisms driving the development of this skill remain largely unclear due to the difficulty of obtaining data with both high spatial and temporal resolution from young children. By analyzing intracranial EEG data collected from childhood (5-10 years old) and post-childhood groups (13-55 years old), we find differential involvement of high-level brain areas in processing facial expression information. For the post-childhood group, both the posterior superior temporal cortex (pSTC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) encode facial emotion features from a high-dimensional, continuous space. However, in children, the facial expression information is only significantly represented in the pSTC, not in the DLPFC. Further, the encoding of complex emotions in pSTC is shown to increase with age. Taken together, these data suggest that young children rely more on low-level sensory areas than on the prefrontal cortex for facial emotion processing, leading us to hypothesize that top-down modulation from prefrontal cortex to pSTC gradually matures during development to enable a full understanding of facial emotions, especially complex emotions which need social and life experience to comprehend.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Incubated cocaine-craving is associated with increased extracellular glutamate within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and this release, particularly within the prelimbic (PL) subregion, is necessary for incubated cocaine-craving. A potential candidate mediating these incubation-driving effects of glutamate release within the PL are alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. To investigate the role of mPFC AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in incubated craving, male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer cocaine for 6 h/day for 10 consecutive days. Either during early or later withdrawal, rats were infused intra-PL with the AMPAR antagonist NBQX (0 or 1 {nu}g/0.5 {nu}l per side), followed by 30-min tests for cue-induced responding. Immunoblotting was also conducted to relate the expression of incubated cocaine- and sucrose-craving to AMPAR subunit expression within mPFC subregions. Intra-PL NBQX blocked incubated craving expressed in late, but not early, withdrawal. No incubation-related changes in AMPAR subunit expression were detected within the PL or IL of rats of either sex and no estrus-associated changes in subunit expression were detected in female rats exhibiting incubated cocaine-craving. In contrast, elevated GluA1 expression was observed within the IL of male rats exhibiting an incubation of sucrose-craving. Together, these findings indicate a necessary role for AMPARs within the PL in driving incubated cocaine-craving and suggest that AMPARs located within the IL may be involved also in sucrose-craving selectively in males.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

K.-Y.; De Combles De Nayves, V.; Cappe, C.; Zoefel, B.", "abstract": "Perceptual targets are often easier to detect and process if they occur at a predictable time. This perceptual benefit of temporal predictability suggests that neural resources are allocated to specific moments predicted to be most informative, or away from those predicted to be distracting. The sensitivity to sensory information changes with the phase of neural oscillations. An alignment of oscillatory phase according to the predicted time and relevance of expected events has therefore been proposed as a mechanism underlying attentional selection. This hypothesis predicts that opposite phases are aligned to relevant and distracting events so that the former are amplified and the latter suppressed, but such an effect remained to be demonstrated. We presented 25 human participants with acoustic stimuli that occurred at a predictable or unpredictable time during a pitch-discrimination task. Temporal predictability did not only lead to faster reaction times, but it also aligned the phase of beta oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG) in anticipation of the stimulus. Crucially, the aligned phase was opposite, depending on whether the stimulus was relevant or a distractor for the task. Single-trial deviations from the mean aligned phases slowed down behavioural responses, demonstrating functional significance of the observed neural effects. All effects occurred in the absence of rhythmic stimulation, an important but rarely tested criterion to rule out spurious phase alignment from preceding events in a stimulus sequence. We therefore conclude that the alignment of oscillatory phase underlies the selection of sensory information in time. We speculate that beta oscillations allocate neural resources in networks comprising auditory and sensorimotor regions to the expected time of auditory information, facilitating behavioural responses to upcoming events.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

S.; Ravithas, R.; Wagner, W.; Vassalli, M.; Di Russo, J.", "abstract": "Mechanical homeostasis in healthy tissues relies on a dynamic balance of mechanical properties essential for maintaining tissue integrity and function. Over the lifetime, this integrity decays due to structural reorganisation from extracellular remodelling or an imbalance of cell death and proliferation. This is particularly challenging in postmitotic tissues such as the retina, where lack of proliferation requires age-dependent structural adaptation. The retinal pigment epithelium exemplifies this adaptation, compensating for apoptotic events through morphological reconfiguration and cytoskeletal remodelling. To explore the connection between age-related structural changes and mechanical homeostasis, we developed an in vitro model mimicking cell density reduction observed in the human retinal pigmented epithelium during ageing. This model is characterised by reduced cell height, shortened apical microvilli, and alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. The resulting age-associated phenotype leads to significant biomechanical changes, including tissue stiffening, enhanced junctional contractility, and apical cell cortex remodelling. Transcriptional profiling revealed notable shifts in actin-associated gene expression, suggesting potentially altered plasticity when actin remodelling is necessary, as for the phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Structurally aged monolayers exhibit changes in phagocytic activity that mirror those seen in aged individuals. Additionally, we observed an impaired capacity for apico-lateral remodelling during the internalisation of photoreceptor outer segments. This altered activity can be partially corrected by regulating actin network remodelling capacity with inhibitors targeting the actin nucleators ARP2/3 and formins. Overall, our findings suggest that age-related structural changes in the postmitotic retinal pigment epithelium shift its mechanical homeostasis, impacting physiological functions of the outer retina crucial for healthy vision.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

Multiple molecular events are implicated in SAC silencing, including removal of phospho-marks, protein (un)binding, and structural reorganisation of the kinetochore - but we currently lack a quantitative map of how these events unfold through time. Here, we use the levels of the checkpoint protein MAD2 to create a pseudo-timeline of SAC silencing at single kinetochores. We demonstrate how silencing proceeds through an ordered series of molecular events where MAD2-Spindly unbinds first and then the KNL1 catalytic platform disassembles, with a pool of active MPS1 retained. Coincidently, the NDC80 ensemble reconfigures in response to high microtubule occupancy. Kinetochores next switch into a mature attachment state that then undergoes gradual further stabilisation through NDC80 tail dephosphorylation. By preventing biorientation, we also define otherwise hidden kinetochore states involved in error correction cycles. This includes a \"poised\" state which we propose allows for error correction and rapid reactivation of the SAC. These results provide a critical temporal framework for understanding the mechanisms of SAC silencing and error correction at single human kinetochores.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}

The NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 (human NEK8/9) and NEKL-3 (human NEK6/7) are conserved regulators of membrane trafficking in Caenorhabditis elegans and are required for successful molting. Through a genetic approach, we isolated reduction-of-function mutations in piki-1 that suppress nekl-associated molting defects. piki-1 encodes the sole predicted C. elegans Class II phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3Ks), an understudied class of lipid modifiers that contribute to the production of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2). Using a set of genetically encoded lipid sensors, we found that PIKI-1 was responsible for the production of PI(3,4)P2 in the C. elegans epidermis but played only a minor role in the control of PI(3)P levels. Consistent with this, both PI(3,4)P2 and PIKI-1 colocalized to early endosomes, and reduction of PIKI-1 function strongly affected early endosomal morphology and protein composition. Additionally, reduced PIKI-1 function led to excess tubulation of endosomal compartments associated with recycling or the degradation of cellular debris. In contrast to previous studies using mammalian cell culture, PIKI-1 was largely dispensable for clathrin-mediated endocytosis in the context of the worm epidermis, which is a polarized epithelium. Notably, reduction of PIKI-1 function strongly mitigated defects in early endosomes associated with the depletion of NEKL-2. We propose that reduction of PIKI-1 function may suppress nekl molting defects by partially restoring endocytic trafficking within specific compartments, including the early endosome. We also show that inhibition of the PI(3,4)P2-binding protein HIPR-1 (HIP1/HIPR1) suppresses nekl molting defects, suggesting that reduced PI(3,4)P2 levels alter endosomal protein recruitment in a manner that antagonizes NEKL-2 function.", "date": "2025-05-23", "journal": ""}
