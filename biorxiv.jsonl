M.; baker, n. e.", "abstract": "Model organisms may help understand how p53 suppresses tumorigenesis in mammals. In Drosophila, the primary transcriptional target of p53 is the gene encoding the bZip AT-hook protein Xrp1, which is another transcription factor. We report that Xrp1 mediated multiple functions of p53 in the DNA damage response (DDR), contributing to p53-dependent gene transcription and DNA damage-induced apoptosis. In addition to this role as a p53 effector, a p53-independent role for Xrp1 in cell competition has been described. Cell competition can remove cells whose genome has been altered by DNA damage and repair. During cell competition, Xrp1 is induced by RpS12, which acts as a sensor of defective ribosome biogenesis. RpS12-dependent cell competition began as the DDR wound down, and was even more prominent if p53 function was reduced. Such p53 inhibition resulted in persistence of DNA damage revealed by gammaH2Av accumulation. Thus, Xrp1 limited the accumulation of abnormal cells resulting from genotoxicity through both the acute, p53-dependent DDR, and also from subsequent cell competition that removes cells where DNA repair did not restore the normal genome. Both these processes might contribute to the tumor suppressor function of p53 in mammals.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

D.; Chen, M.; Wen, T.; Awasthi, P.; Sterling, C.; Brahmbhatt, D.; Cryns, V. L.; Anderson, R. A.", "abstract": "Phosphoinositide (PIPn) messengers are present in non-membranous regions of nuclei where they are assembled into a phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway that is distinct from the cytosolic membrane-localized pathway. In the nuclear pathway, PI kinases/phosphatases bind the p53 tumor suppressor protein (wild-type and mutant) to generate p53-PIPn complexes (p53-PIPn signalosome) that activate Akt by a PI3,4,5P3-dependent mechanism in non-membranous regions of the nucleus. This pathway is dependent on a source of nuclear PIPns that is poorly characterized. Here we report that a subset of PI transfer proteins (PITPs), which transport PI between membranes to enable membrane-localized PIPn synthesis, also interact with p53 in the nucleus upon genotoxic stress. Class I PITPs (PITP/{beta}) specifically supply the PI required for the generation of p53-PIPn complexes and subsequent signaling in the nucleus. Additionally, the PI 4-kinase PI4KII binds to p53 and the PITPs to catalyze the formation of p53-PI4P. p53-PI4P is then sequentially phosphorylated to synthesize p53-PIPn complexes that regulate p53 stability, nuclear Akt activation and genotoxic stress resistance. In this way, PITP/{beta} and PI4KII bind p53 and collaborate to initiate p53-PIPn signaling by mechanisms that require PI transfer by PITP/{beta} and the catalytic activity of PI4KII. Moreover, the identification of these critical upstream regulators of p53-PIPn signaling point to PITP/{beta} and PI4KII as potential therapeutic targets in this pathway for diseases like cancer.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

The ability to detect a regime shift, such as the onset of a pandemic or the end of a recession, significantly impacts individual decisions as well as governmental policies. However, determining whether a regime has changed is usually not obvious, as signals are noisy and reflective of the volatility of the environment. We designed an fMRI paradigm that examines a stylized regime-shift detection task. Human participants showed systematic over- and underreaction: Overreaction was most commonly seen when signals were noisy but when environments were stable and change is possible but unlikely. By contrast, underreaction was observed when signals were precise but when environments were unstable and hence change was more likely. These behavioral signatures are consistent with the system-neglect computational hypothesis, which posits that sensitivity or lack thereof to system parameters (noise and volatility) is central to these behavioral biases. Guided by this computational framework, we found that individual subjects' sensitivity to system parameters were represented by two distinct brain networks. Whereas a frontoparietal network selectively represented individuals' sensitivity to signal noise but not environment volatility, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed the opposite pattern. Further, these two networks were involved in different aspects of regime-shift computations: while vmPFC correlated with subjects' beliefs about change, the frontoparietal network represented the strength of evidence in favor of regime shifts. Together, these results suggest that regime-shift detection recruits belief-updating and evidence-evaluation networks and that under- and overreactions arise from how sensitive these networks are to the system parameters.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Dec1-disrupted mice develop lifelong glucose intolerance and insulin deficiency, despite normal islet formation and intact Clock/Bmal1 genes. Metabolic dysfunction upon {beta}-cell Dec1 loss stems from poor coupling of insulin secretion to glucose metabolism, reminiscent of fetal/neonatal immaturity. We link stunted maturation to a deficit in circadian bioenergetics, prompted by compromised glucose utilization, mitochondrial dynamics, and respiratory metabolism, which is rescued by increased metabolic flux.

Using the protozoan parasite Leishmania as a model system, we have recently demonstrated that infection causes histone H3 hypomethylation, which is associated with the establishment of an anti-inflammatory phenotype, suggesting that host cell demethylases may play a role in the intracellular survival of these parasites. In this study, we combined pharmacological inhibition with RNA sequencing and quantitative immune-precipitation analysis to investigate the role of the macrophage lysine demethylase LSD1 (KDM1a) in Leishmania intracellular infection in vitro. Treatment of infected macrophages with validated, LSD1-specific inhibitors resulted in a significant reduction in parasite burden. We confirmed the impact of these inhibitors on LSD1 activity within macrophage nuclear extracts using an in vitro demethylase assay and established their LSD1 target engagement in situ by cellular thermal shift assay. RNA-seq analysis of infected and inhibitor-treated macrophages linked parasite killing to a partial reversion of infection-dependent expression changes, restoring the macrophage anti-microbial response and limiting cholesterol biosynthesis. While we ruled out any impact of Leishmania on LSD1 expression or localization, we uncovered significant alterations in LSD1 complex formation within infected macrophages, involving unique interactions with host cell regulatory proteins such as Rcor-1.

Human immunity to C. albicans infection is thought to be largely dependent on neutrophil reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) generation by neutrophils. Despite this, our understanding of innate immune killing and escape by C. albicans is primarily studied in macrophages and the precise mechanisms of evasion are unclear in neutrophils. Here we sought to determine the importance of neutrophil reactive nitrogen species (RNS) production during C. albicans infection in vivo. Using a zebrafish model, we found that C. albicans rapidly downregulated neutrophil RNS below basal levels during the first day post infection, a time at which neutrophil RNS is upregulated in bacterial infections as an important host-defense mechanism, indicating fungal evasion of host neutrophils. We confirmed downregulation of RNS in human primary neutrophils and with clinical Candida spp. isolates, including emerging human pathogens C. auris and C. glabrata. Using a zebrafish arginase 2 transgenic line and a C. albicans car1{Delta} mutant, we show that both host and fungal arginase contribute the reduction in neutrophil RNS. Despite pathogen downregulation, upregulation of neutrophil RNS via Hypoxia inducible factor (Hif)-1 stabilisation, was sufficient to improve C. albicans infection survival, dependent on the presence of neutrophils and Nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2). Finally, restoration of neutrophil RNS, via Hif-1 stabilisation, was synergistic with clinically relevant antifungal treatment, increasing survival and clearance of C. albicans infections. Together, these data demonstrate that restoration of the neutrophil RNS response in C. albicans infection improves infection outcomes, highlighting the potential of targeting Hif-1 and RNS in host directed therapies against fungal infections.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

These behaviors can be reduced to an axis of valence, whereby specific odors evoke approach or avoidance responses. The posterolateral cortical amygdala (plCoA) mediates innate attraction and aversion to odor. However, little is known about how this brain area gives rise to behaviors of opposing motivational valence. Here, we sought to define the circuit features of plCoA that give rise to innate attraction and aversion to odor. We characterized the physiology, gene expression, and projections of this structure, identifying a divergent, topographic organization that selectively controls innate attraction and avoidance to odor. First, we examined odor-evoked responses in these areas and found sparse encoding of odor identity, but not valence. We next considered a topographic organization and found that optogenetic stimulation of the anterior and posterior domains of plCoA elicits attraction and avoidance, respectively, suggesting a functional axis for valence. Using single cell and spatial RNA sequencing, we identified the molecular cell types in plCoA, revealing an anteroposterior gradient in cell types, whereby anterior glutamatergic neurons preferentially express VGluT2 and posterior neurons express VGluT1. Activation of these respective cell types recapitulates appetitive and aversive behaviors, and chemogenetic inhibition reveals partial necessity for responses to innate appetitive or aversive odors. Finally, we identified topographically organized circuits defined by projections, whereby anterior neurons preferentially project to medial amygdala, and posterior neurons preferentially project to nucleus accumbens, which are respectively sufficient and necessary for innate attraction and aversion. Together, these data advance our understanding of how the olfactory system generates stereotypic, hardwired attraction and avoidance, and supports a model whereby distinct, topographically distributed plCoA populations direct innate olfactory responses by signaling to divergent valence-specific targets, linking upstream olfactory identity to downstream valence behaviors, through a population code. This suggests a novel amygdala circuit motif in which valence encoding is represented not by the firing properties of individual neurons, but by population level identity encoding that is routed through divergent targets to mediate distinct behaviors of opposing appetitive and aversive responses.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce an ultra-precision ST deconvolution algorithm (UCASpatial) that enhances the mapping of cell subpopulations to spatial locations by leveraging the contribution of genes indicative of cell identity through entropy-based weighting. Using both in silico and real ST datasets, we demonstrate that UCASpatial improves the robustness and accuracy in identifying low-abundant cell subpopulations and distinguishing transcriptionally heterogeneous cell subpopulations. Applying UCASpatial to human colorectal cancer (CRC), we link genomic alterations in individual cancer clones to multi-cellular characteristics of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) and reveal the co-evolution of tumor cells and TIME at a clonal resolution. We show that the copy number gain on chromosome 20q (chr20q-gain) in tumor cells orchestrates a T cell-excluded TIME, indicative of resistance to immunotherapy in CRC, and is associated with tumor-intrinsic human endogenous retrovirus subfamily H (HERV-H) silencing and impaired type I interferon response. In murine wound healing models, we illuminate the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual cell subsets across various stages of the healing process.

The Igfbp5+ chondrocyte, spatially coordinating with Cd36+ Gpnmb+ Il1b- macrophage and Fmod+ fibroblast, forms a pro-fibrotic community associated with regeneration failure. The cell-cell interactions within this three-cell cluster, mediated by the IL11-IL11RA axis, drive the pro-fibrotic community formation and limit regeneration in C57BL/6 mice.

Self-fertilisation can counter these effects through creating homozygous genotypes and purging deleterious mutations. Although complete asexuality lacks meiotic gene exchange, mitotic gene conversion creates homozygous regions that could limit deleterious mutation accumulation in an analogous manner. We compare mutation accumulation in self-fertilising and facultative sexual populations subject to mitotic gene conversion, and quantify the efficacy of purging in the latter. We first show analytically that purging is most effective with high levels of asexuality and gene conversion, and when deleterious mutations are recessive. We further show using simulations that, when mitotic gene conversion becomes sufficiently high in obligate asexuals, there is a reduction in the mutation count and a jump in homozygosity, reflecting purging. These effects are stronger than predicted from single-locus models, demonstrating how multi-locus purging can further reduce mutation prevalence in asexuals. However, this mechanism is not necessarily as efficient at purging under high self-fertilisation, and elevated rates of mitotic gene conversion seem to be needed for widespread purging compared to empirical estimates.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Inter-individual variability in language and music skills has been repeatedly associated with the structure of the auditory cortex: the shape, size and asymmetry of the transverse temporal gyrus (TTG) or gyri (TTGs). TTG is highly variable in shape and size, some individuals having one single gyrus (also referred to as Heschls gyrus, HG) while others presenting duplications (with a common stem or fully separated) or higher-order multiplications of TTG. Both genetic and environmental influences on childrens cognition, behavior, and brain can to some to degree be traced back to familial and parental factors. In the current study, using a unique MRI dataset of parents and children (135 individuals from 37 families), we ask whether the anatomy of the auditory cortex is related to reading skills, and whether there are intergenerational effects on TTG(s) anatomy. For this, we performed detailed, automatic segmentations of HG and of additional TTG(s), when present, extracting volume, surface area, thickness and shape of the gyri. We tested for relationships between these and reading skill, and assessed their degree of familial similarity and intergenerational transmission effects. We found that volume and area of all identified left TTG(s) combined was positively related to reading scores, both in children and adults. With respect to intergenerational similarities in the structure of the auditory cortex, we identified structural brain similarities for mother-child pairs of the 1st TTG (HG) (in terms of volume, area and thickness for the right HG, and shape for the left HG) and of the lateralization of all TTG(s) surface area for father-child pairs. Both the HG and TTG-lateralization findings were significantly more likely for parent-child dyads than for unrelated adult-child pairs. Furthermore, we established characteristics of parents TTG that are related to better reading abilities in children: fathers small left HG, and a small ratio of HG to planum temporale.

We demonstrate that E. coli exhibits significantly enhanced chemotaxis in lanes with sidewalls compared to open surfaces. We attribute this phenomenon primarily to the intrinsic clockwise circular motion of surface-swimming bacteria and the subsequent alignment effect upon collision with the sidewalls. By varying lane widths, we identify that an 8 m width-approximating the radius of bacterial circular swimming on surfaces-maximizes chemotactic drift velocity. These results are supported by both experimental observations and stochastic simulations, establishing a clear proportional relationship between optimal lane width and the radius of bacterial circular swimming.

The nociceptive sensory neuropeptide alpha calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) was previously detected in synovial fluid and serum of osteoarthritis patients and was also described as trophic factor for chondrocytes, affecting ECM organisation and biomechanical properties. Here, we investigated the potential of CGRP to alter the chondrocyte mechanoresponse, and thus to affect the resilience of cartilage towards mechanical loading. Methods: Tissue-engineered neocartilage based on human articular chondrocytes was treated with 1M CGRP for 24 hours and subjected to an anabolic loading protocol (intermittent dynamic compression, 1Hz, 25%) for the last 3 hours before analysing its molecular mechano-response. Results: Mechanotransduction was largely unaltered by CGRP as demonstrated by ERK activation and stimulation of mechano-regulated gene expression, yet load-stimulated glycosaminoglycan synthesis was disturbed by CGRP. Presence of CGRP did not affect stimulation of WNT5A expression by loading, but decreased DKK3 expression under loading. Importantly, WNT inhibition prevented the negative effect of CGRP on load-stimulated glycosaminoglycan synthesis. Conclusion: Identifying WNT5A as a novel mechano-response gene, we reveal that CGRP can block the load-stimulated proteoglycan production of human chondrocytes in the presence of WNT pathway activity. Thus, our data propose a novel, negative role for the pain-mediator CGRP in the cartilage loading response, compromising its resilience to loading. Overall, our study implicates CGRP as a potential target for osteoarthritis treatment, but also in patient stratification.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

While state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning predictors offer high accuracy, they often lack the transparency required for clinical evidence weighting. To bridge this gap between accuracy and clinical utility, we developed AlphaRING-X. Methods: AlphaRING-X is an open-source framework that integrates local and global protein structural stability features using an efficient implementation of gradient boosting, XGBoost, to predict variant deleteriousness. Local stability is interrogated through a combination of AlphaFold-based modelling and residue interaction network analysis. Changes in global stability upon mutation ({Delta}{Delta}G) are estimated using FoldX. For each prediction, AlphaRING-X quantifies the magnitude and direction of each feature's contribution using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), providing a unified yet interpretable score. We trained and evaluated the model using a gold standard ClinVar dataset of validated neutral and deleterious variants. Results: AlphaRING-X achieved an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.94, significantly outperforming widely used predictors such as CADD. Crucially, it provided unambiguous classification for 95.5% of variants at 90% precision in both neutral and deleterious classes. We analysed each prediction's SHAP values, identifying local connectivity and disorder as the strongest contributors. Conclusions: AlphaRING-X combines high-performance prediction with the interpretability necessary for clinical decision-making. Its flexible, open-source architecture makes it a powerful, transparent tool for enhancing genomic diagnostics and advancing precision medicine.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Different lines of evidence implicate the prefrontal cortex (especially the anterior cingulate cortex, ACC), dopaminergic, and cholinergic substrates in this modulation. We studied here the activity of these substrates at increasing time on task (requiring increasing levels of cognitive effort) in trials within blocks with differing reward levels. In the cortex, while peaking in the ACC, activity associated with time on task was extensive, also including activity decrements outside the default mode network, primarily involving motor and somatosensory regions. Information about reward levels was carried in the ventral striatum, consistent with its motivational role, but did not reflect trade-offs with increasing efforts during time on task. Instead, the ventral tegmental area and parts of the basal forebrain (BF) corresponding to the cholinergic Ch4 nuclei increased in activity with time on task and were sensitive to reward levels. This BF activity is consistent with a cholinergic role in driving compensatory efforts modulated by reward levels. These findings identify the BF as a neuroimaging phenotype associated with sustaining task sets and cognitive efforts.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

To investigate more closely the mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 entry and intracellular trafficking, I reanalyzed the most extensive SARS-CoV-2-human protein-protein interactome dataset currently available. My investigation centered on the Spike S protein, a key player in initiating viral infection by binding to the host cell membrane receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). I first present evidence demonstrating the statistical overrepresentation of actin-binding proteins among the Spike S partners/interactors. Next, I show that a majority of these partners contains a structural domain sharing high similarity with the C-terminal region of the Myosin II heavy chain, Myosin II being known for its roles in muscle contraction and various cellular motility processes. I subsequently demonstrate that this domain is particularly prevalent in actin-binding proteins, intermediate filaments proteins and kinesins, which all are related to the cytoskeleton known to be involved in diverse cellular functions, including endocytosis and intracellular transport - processes crucial for viral infections. Finally, I highlight that the structural domain mentioned above is a bonafide coiled-coil region. I therefore conclude that Spike S might target proteins possessing such regions. Collectively, my findings suggest that the interactions between SARS-CoV-2 Spike S and human proteins, potentially mediated by coiled-coil regions, may have been underestimated.

Previous studies on predator-prey dynamics tracking simple ecological and phenotypic metrics have shown predation to fundamentally alter prey evolution, facilitating defense evolution followed by coevolution and frequency dependent selection between defended and undefended prey genotypes. Here we sought to consolidate these fields by examining genome-wide evolution in five bacterial prey species separately subjected to long-term evolution under ciliate predation. We hypothesized that the presence of predation could change the pattern of clonal dynamics, for example, by more frequently producing selective sweeps if predation-defense-related mutations are under strong selection. For all species, we found mutational signals of prey adaptation, with phenotypic data and genomic mutation targets demonstrating changes in composition between the experimental treatments. Intriguingly, despite higher variant counts, overall temporal clade dynamics across the coevolved prey species were strikingly similar to those of bacteria evolving alone, with constant emergence, competition and quasi-stable coexistence of clades. This study shows that long-term molecular evolution in bacterial prey under predation is more interesting and less predictable than we might expect based on existing coevolutionary theories.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

BPAN is caused by de novo pathogenic variants in the WDR45 gene on the X chromosome. WDR45 gene encodes the protein WDR45/WIPI4, a known regulator of autophagy. A defective autophagy has been observed in cellular models of BPAN disease and is associated with neurological dysfunctions in wdr45 knockout (KO) mice. However, it remains unclear whether the autophagic defect directly contributes to all WDR45 loss-induced phenotypes or whether other WDR45-dependent cellular functions are involved. To investigate this, we generated a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO of CG11975 (dwdr45 KO), the Drosophila homolog of WDR45. Our analysis revealed that dwdr45 KO flies display BPAN-like phenotypes, including impaired locomotor function, seizure-like behavior, autophagy dysregulation and iron dyshomeostasis. Additionally, dwdr45 KO flies exhibit shortened lifespan compared to control flies. These findings demonstrate that dwdr45 KO fly is a relevant in-vivo model for investigating the key cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying BPAN-associated phenotypes. Here we showed that induction of autophagy in dwdr45 KO flies improved both the shortened lifespan and the seizure-like behavior, but did not restore locomotor function. This suggests that defective autophagy contributes to some, but not all, aspects of the phenotypes resulting from loss of dWdr45 function.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Even in populations with causal familial AD mutations, there is variation in disease onset and progression, suggesting that clinical symptoms are modified by genetics and environment. Identification of such modifiers is critical, as mechanisms that promote resilience to high-risk AD mutations, unhealthy diet, or aging represent promising therapeutic targets for AD; global resilience factors that protect against multiple hits are among the highest priority for discovery. Both genetic and environmental protective factors in AD have been identified; however, GxE factors are incredibly difficult to study in human populations given complex genomes, poor self-reporting, limited data from underrepresented groups, and incompletely documented exposomes. Here, we (1) validate novel GxE tools using population of mouse strains that model the polygenic nature of human AD, (2) characterize individuals with cognitive resilience to high-risk genetic and dietary perturbations, (3) define and quantitate roles for genetics, sex, age, and diet, and (4) present data for the discovery of complex interactions that are nearly impossible to elucidate from humans or inbred mice. We found that a high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) diet is not universally damaging, as some strains showed an improved AD-related cognitive outcome when fed a HFHS diet, suggesting the need for personalized recommendations for dietary interventions in AD. Cognitive resilience to AD is polygenic; however, we found a locus on Chr 10 that was modestly associated with cognitive resilience to AD in females, and this association was strengthened by HFHS diet, pointing to an unexpected interaction between specific genetic loci and unhealthy diet in AD risk and resilience.

Here we show that brief pharmacologic inhibition of SUMO conjugation in human pre-adipocytes using TAK-981 primes stable de novo beige differentiation in the presence of the PPARG agonist rosiglitazone. Transient TAK-981 exposure before adipogenic induction produces long-lasting changes in the transcriptome and metabolism of mature adipocytes, including robust induction of canonical beiging markers like UCP1 and increased mitochondrial respiration. Mechanistically, ATAC-seq and transcription factor footprinting revealed immediate and durable chromatin remodeling and early mobilization of CEBP family members, followed by stable activation of CEBPA and PPARG regulatory networks. ChIP experiments demonstrated loss of H3K27me3 and gain of H3K27ac at PPAR response elements within key thermogenic enhancers, with increased PPARG occupancy across the UCP1 regulatory unit. This mechanism is enforced by enhanced cAMP-PKA-p38 signaling, and stabilization of beiging transcriptional activators. Our data support a model in which transient relief of SUMO-mediated repression unlocks dominant regulatory units, notably the UCP1 enhancer cluster, producing a monomorphic, cell type specific reprogramming toward adaptive thermogenesis.

Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K with copanlisib or genetic knockout via CRISPR-Cas9 restored sotorasib sensitivity, suppressed colony formation, and inhibited downstream effectors, including p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-S6, p70S6K, p-GSK3b, and p-PRAS40 in AR cells. copanlisib also sensitized both acquired and primary resistant PDXOs and synergized with sotorasib in restoring drug sensitivity. We found that p4E-BP1 was significantly upregulated in H23AR and H358AR cells, and copanlisib suppressed its expression. The level of p4E-BP1 expression was correlated with Sotorasib sensitivity in PI3K knockout clones, where the most sensitive clone displayed reduced or no p4E-BP1 expression. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of 4E-BP1, either alone or in combination with PI3K knockout, dramatically restored sotorasib sensitivity to levels comparable to parental cells. Suppression of 4E-BP1 hyperphosphorylation required dual inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2, and treatment with AZD8055 or sapanisertib (mTORC1/2 dual inhibitors) significantly dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 and restored sotorasib sensitivity in resistant cells and PDXOs. In contrast, everolimus (a mTORC1-selective inhibitor) did not restore sotorasib sensitivity. In PDX, CDX, and xenograft models in vivo, the combination of sotorasib with either copanlisib or sapanisertib resulted in robust, synergistic, and durable tumor regression at well-tolerated doses. These findings showed the critical role of PI3K/mTOR signaling as a bypass mechanism of resistance to KRASG12C inhibitors.

Recent studies have demonstrated that tRNAs experience exceptionally high rates of transcription-associated mutagenesis (TAM) as well as strong purifying selection. How the mutational input of TAM, which induces a non-uniform distribution of nucleotide substitutions, affects the fitness of tRNA molecules is unclear. Secondary structure in tRNAs is strongly conserved over macro-evolutionary time, suggesting that mutations that disrupt paired sites may be especially deleterious, but TAM-induced mutations primarily involve nucleotide transitions, which tend to preserve base-pairing stability. To examine how TAM affects tRNA molecule fitness and shapes tRNA evolution over short timescales, we analyzed tRNA allelic variation in contemporary Caenorhabditis elegans strains. We propose a model of tRNA microevolution driven by TAM and demonstrate that the observed secondary structure characteristics align with our predicted TAM-biased patterns. Furthermore, we developed a continuous Markov substitution model that incorporates TAM-specific mutational biases. This TAM-biased model fits the C. elegans tRNA data more effectively than standard models, such as the general time-reversible (GTR) model. Based on these results, we conclude that tRNAs in natural populations carry substantial levels of structure-destabilizing mutations, which may be tolerated but nevertheless likely induce meaningful fitness costs. Our findings are consistent with recent experimental studies on tRNA fitness in yeast but challenge prior theoretical and computational analyses that emphasize RNA base-pairing as a primary determinant in genotype-phenotype systems.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

We overcome these limitations by developing species-level consensus TAD maps for human and mouse using a bag-of-genes approach that exposes emergent regulatory structure. To quantify TAD-mediated gene relationships, we leverage a generative AI foundation model computed from 33 million transcriptomes to define a contextual similarity metric, revealing higher-order gene relationships elusive to co-expression analysis. We find that TADs are regions of elevated gene co-regulation, and our analytical framework directly leads to testable hypotheses about chromatin organization across cellular states. We discover that the TAD-linked enhancement of transcriptional context is strongest in early developmental stages and systematically declines with aging. Investigation of cancer cells show distinct patterns of TAD usage that shift with chemotherapy treatment. Enhancing our understanding of cellular plasticity in differentiation and disease, these findings suggest that chromatin organization may act through probabilistic mechanisms rather than deterministic rules.\n\nSoftware availabilityhttps://singhlab.net/tadmap", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

EVs containing mitochondria had a larger size (maximum diameter) when coming from treated cells (1.8 +/- 0.89 um) as compared to control cells (1.63+/- 0.76 um). Moreover, their Young s moduli were higher in the treated condition (3.09 +/- 2.54 MPa in average) as compared to the control condition (1.25 +/- 0.92 MPa in average).

Finally, applying linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms on maximum diameter, height, and distribution of Young s modulus values, we demonstrated the possibility to discriminate between EV subpopulations. Indeed, we successfully managed to a) distinguish EVs containing mitochondria from the empty ones, with an accuracy of 84% and b) discriminate whether these mitochondria-containing EVs originated from control or treated conditions, with an accuracy of 76%. These findings highlight the power of combining morpho-mechanical analysis and machine learning for identifying and discriminating EV subpopulations, no longer requiring any EVs fluorescence labelling.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Fully integrated in the SpikeInterface ecosystem, UnitRefine combines established and novel quality metrics, cascading classification and comprehensive hyperparameter search to provide optimized models for different applications. UnitRefine achieves human-level performance across diverse datasets, spanning species, probe types, and laboratories, including recordings from mice, rats, mole rats, primates, and human patients. Applied to a large brain-wide dataset, UnitRefine doubled single unit yield and improved behavioral decoding performance.

In Drosophila, ovulation is induced by mating but also occurs spontaneously in virgins, with rates varying widely in natural populations: short oocyte retention is ancestral, while longer retention is favored in colder climates. The molecular regulation of spontaneous ovulation remains unclear. Here, we show that disrupting the relaxin/insulin-like peptide Dilp8 or its receptor Lgr3--an orthologue of vertebrate relaxin RXFP1/2 receptors--in follicle cells or specific neurons, respectively, delays ovulation, slows average egg transit time in the reproductive tract, and facilitates oogenesis progression beyond ~2 mature oocytes per ovariole, leading to mature follicle accumulation in the ovary. Mating largely rescues these defects, suggesting the pathway is dispensable post-mating. Dilp8-Lgr3 signaling ensures high oocyte quality by promoting elimination of lower-quality aging oocytes and by antagonizing oogenesis progression via an undefined mechanism downstream of Lgr3+ neurons. Our findings provide a molecular basis for oocyte retention time regulation in Drosophila involving ovarian-nervous system cross-talk, and bring further support for an ancient, conserved role for relaxin-like signaling in regulating ovulation and overall female reproductive physiology.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Unlike conventional T cells, CAR-T cells are activated by intact antigen expressed on tumors, not by peptide/MHC expressed on APCs, restricting their activation to the hostile tumor microenvironment (TME) that may impair preservation of this critical stem-like subset. Indeed, in an autochthonous model of ROR1+ lung cancer that we developed, CAR-T cells targeting the tumor-associated antigen ROR1 were uniformly Tcf1+ prior to infusion but rapidly downregulated Tcf1 in vivo and became terminally exhausted, similar to observations in patients, resulting in faster attrition and no enhancement in response to PD-L1 blockade. We hypothesized that overexpression of AP-1 family transcription factors, which can regulate T cell exhaustion, could enable CAR-Ts to maintain this critical PD-1+Tcf1+ subset within tumors independently of APCs and sensitize them to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Overexpression of the AP-1 TF c-Jun, but not BATF, improved preservation of PD-1+Tcf1+ CAR-T cells within tumors in a cell-intrinsic manner that correlated with increased persistence deeper within tumors. Notably, c-Jun overexpression alone was insufficient to prevent CAR-T exhaustion in the lung TME, in contrast to prior work in xenograft models, with progressive CAR-T dysfunction correlated with PD-1-dependent downregulation of c-Jun. However, c-Jun overexpression dramatically sensitized CAR-Ts to PD-L1 blockade, which restored c-Jun levels in CAR-Ts, drove log-fold expansion of CAR-Ts within tumors, and induced nearly complete eradication of ROR1+ tumor in highly aggressive models of lung cancer. Altogether, our data show that combination with PD-L1 blockade is necessary to unleash the full potential of c-Jun-overexpressing CAR-T cells in aggressive solid tumors like lung cancer and suggest that strategies to enhance formation of intratumoral PD-1+Tcf1+ reservoirs can overcome CAR-T resistance to PD-1 blockade.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

The well-defined structure of hippocampal fields and the segregation of the connections have made this structure a favorite candidate for functional models, that rely on fundamental information such as the number of neurons populating the hippocampal fields. Existing models on the rat rely on neuronal populations obtained from single studies, so we aimed to obtain more representative estimates by analyzing all available data. We identified 89 studies using reliable methodology that provided 264 stereological estimates of principal neuron populations. The resulting averages for males showed 1,000,000 neurons for the granule cell layer (GCL); 50,000 for the hilus; 210,000 for CA3; ~30,000 for CA2; 350,000 for CA1 and 300,000 for the Subiculum.

Our scope included clinically-used and clinically-effective antidepressant treatments, both pharmacological and neuromodulatory. The outcome variable was gene expression, as measured by microarray or RNA-Seq, from bulk dissected tissue from two brain regions linked to depression, the hippocampus and cortex.\n\nMethodsRelevant datasets were identified in the Gemma database of curated, reprocessed transcriptional profiling data using pre-defined search terms and inclusion/exclusion criteria (hippocampus: 6-24-2024, cortex: 7-10-2024). Differential expression results were extracted for all available genes, minimizing bias. For each gene, a random effects meta-analysis model was fit to the antidepressant vs. control effect sizes (Log2 Fold Changes) from each study for each brain region, with exploratory analyses examining traditional and non-traditional antidepressant categories separately.\n\nResultsFor the hippocampus, 15 relevant studies were identified, containing 22 antidepressant vs. control group comparisons. These treatment comparisons represented a collective n=313 samples, approximately half of which received traditional versus non-traditional antidepressants. Of the 16,439 genes with stable meta-analysis estimates, 58 were consistently differentially expressed (False Discovery Rate (FDR)<0.05) following treatment. Antidepressant effects were enriched in gene sets related to stress regulation, brain growth and plasticity, vascular and glial function, and immune function. Comparisons with findings from single nucleus RNA-Seq confirmed antidepressant effects on specific hippocampal cell types, including promoting an immature phenotype in dentate granule neurons. For the cortex, 14 studies were identified, containing 17 antidepressant vs. control group comparisons (collective n=260). Of the 14,344 genes with stable meta-analysis estimates, only one was consistently differentially expressed (FDR<0.05: Atp6v1b2), but the overall pattern of expression correlated with that observed in the hippocampus.\n\nConclusionGenes and pathways that are consistently differentially expressed across treatment categories may serve as linchpins for antidepressant efficacy, providing promising targets for novel therapies. Future work should explore the relevance of these findings to human clinical populations, and explore potential heterogeneity introduced by sex, region, and drug category.\n\nKey PointsO_LIDepression can be treated with traditional antidepressants targeting monoaminergic function, as well as multiple other drug classes and non-pharmaceutical interventions.\nC_LIO_LIUnderstanding the congruent effects of different types of antidepressant treatments on sensitive brain regions, such as the hippocampus and cortex, can highlight essential mechanisms of action.\nC_LIO_LIA meta-analysis of public transcriptional profiling datasets identified genes and functional gene sets that are differentially expressed across antidepressant categories.\nC_LI\n\nPlain Language SummaryMajor depressive disorder is characterized by persistent depressed mood and loss of interest and pleasure in life. Worldwide, an estimated 5% of adults suffer from depression, making it a leading cause of disability. The current standard of care for depressed individuals includes psychotherapy and antidepressant medications that enhance signaling by monoamine neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and norepinephrine. Other treatments include non-traditional antidepressants that function via alternative, often unknown, mechanisms. To identify mechanisms of action shared across different categories of antidepressants, we performed a meta-analysis using public datasets to characterize changes in gene expression (mRNA) following treatment with both traditional and non-traditional antidepressants. We focused on the hippocampus and cortex, which are two brain regions that are sensitive to both depression and antidepressant usage. We found 59 genes that had consistently higher or lower levels of expression (mRNA) across antidepressant categories. The functions associated with these genes were diverse, including regulation of stress response, the immune system, brain growth and adaptability. These genes are worth investigating further as potential linchpins for antidepressant efficacy or as targets for novel therapies.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/648805v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c83a57org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6e2cd2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@140ba4corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@86da60_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

While prior research has focused on tangible incentives (e.g., money or food), the effects of intrinsic incentives -- such as perceived competence -- are less well understood. Across a series of visual estimation experiments, we manipulated observers' subjective sense of confidence in their judgements using either deceptive trial-by-trial feedback or real discrepancies in stimulus reliability. We found that observers prioritised encoding of stimuli associated with lower uncertainty or error, benefiting performance for stimuli already estimated accurately, while further impairing performance for those estimated poorly. These reward-driven biases, while potentially adaptive, impaired overall accuracy in the present tasks by causing resource allocation to deviate from the error-minimizing strategy. To account for these findings, we supplemented a normalization model of neural resource allocation with a simple reinforcement learning rule. Intrinsic and extrinsic rewards cumulatively shaped the values assigned to different stimuli by the model, and the resulting discrepancies biased resource allocation and thereby estimation error, quantitatively matching the data. These findings reveal how intrinsic reward signals can shape resource allocation in ways that are both adaptive and counterproductive, offering a computational basis for the motivational biases underlying cognitive performance.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Since it becomes increasingly more important to track individual mouse behaviours and its influence on brain plasticity, we designed a gated running wheel (gRW) setup allowing to correlate individual wheel running parameters with individual measures of neuronal plasticity, using the established paradigm of OD-plasticity after monocular deprivation (MD). After SC-rearing until adulthood (>P110), group-housed mice were transferred to gRW cages, where each home cage was connected to a compartment with an upright running wheel allowing to track individual wheel activity via implanted RFID chips. Notably, individual running parameters varied enormously: individual mice ran from close to 0 to ~20 km across the 7 days of gRW experience, with on average running 0-3.96 km in 0-3.85 h/d and running bouts lasting from <1 up to 10 min, while running at a speed of 6-26 cm/s. OD-plasticity in V1 after 7 days of MD in the gRW was visualized using intrinsic signal optical imaging, and compared to control gRW-mice without MD. Wheel running during MD restored OD-plasticity of adult SC-mice: without MD, visual stimulation of the contralateral eye induced stronger activation of V1 compared to the ipsilateral eye. In contrast, after MD, V1-activation via both eyes was more balanced indicating OD-plasticity. Most notably, individual running parameters correlated with individual OD-indices after MD: Mice running longer distances, for longer time, at higher speeds and with longer and more frequent bouts displayed a stronger OD-shift, i.e. animals showed more experience-dependent V1-plasticity. In turn, a composite measure of overall running wheel activity derived from principal component analysis of running parameters accounted for 65% of inter-individual variability of OD-index following MD. Together our study demonstrates that interindividual variability of running behaviour is high, and mice intrinsically motivated to run more show enhanced V1-plasticity, underscoring the huge importance of analysing individual behavioural parameters together with any measure of brain plasticity.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Cryo-OrbiSIMS was used in combination with ToF-SIMS to identify metabolite profiles from the biological deposit found on the implants after removal from the tissue which were previously unattainable using tissue sectioning. Machine learning and statistical analysis of the profiles were used to help identify early biointerface responses to the implant, including at 1 day of implantation the observation of elevated sugars and itaconate an immunomodulatory metabolite that modulates FBR. At day 28 inflammation associated markers were observed such as urate and palmitic acid (FA 16:0). Depth profiling revealed two distinct molecular layers in the deposits: amino acids, and nucleic acids were preferentially seen towards the host tissue, consistent with the observation of a cell monolayer in the tissue sections, whereas certain lipids and fatty acids where either at the catheter-deposit interface or towards the host tissue after 28 days.

First, we reanalyze a study of carcinogen exposure in mice, determining that eleven of twenty tested carcinogens produce significant mutation spectrum shifts. Only three of these carcinogens were previously reported to induce distinct mutational signatures, suggesting that many carcinogens perturb mutagenesis by altering the composition of endogenous signatures. Next, we interrogate whether patient ancestry has a measurable impact on human tumor mutation spectra, finding significant ancestry-associated differences across ten cancer types.

The speed with which they exchange components with the cellular environment can influence how fast biochemical reactions occur inside condensates and how fast condensates respond to environmental changes, thereby directly impacting condensate function. While Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) experiments are routinely performed to measure this exchange timescale, it remains a challenge to distinguish the various physical processes limiting fluorescence recovery and identify each associated timescale. Here, we present a reaction-diffusion model for condensate exchange dynamics and show that such exchange can differ significantly from that of conventional liquid droplets due to the presence of a percolated molecular network, which gives rise to different mobility species in the dense phase. In this model, exchange can be limited by diffusion of either the high- or low-mobility species in the dense phase, diffusion in the dilute phase, or the attachment/detachment of molecules to/from the network at the surface or throughout the bulk of the condensate. Through a combination of analytic derivations and numerical simulations, we quantify the contributions of these distinct physical processes to the overall exchange timescale and predict an experimentally testable scaling relationship between the exchange timescale and condensate size. We discover that the exchange dynamics can be accelerated via a pore-mediated pathway in which molecules pass through the pores of the meshwork and attach/detach directly in the condensate interior. Notably, this pathway leads to a new regime in which the exchange timescale becomes independent of condensate size, which we validate through FRAP experiments on a biosynthetic DNA nanostar system.

Classic enzymology, which established metabolite flow before gene sequencing, offers experimentally validated precursor-product relationships that could overcome these ambiguities. We evaluated whether enzymology-defined precursor-product correlations are consistently detectable in human plasma LC-MS data. We detected amino acids, carnitine-related, TCA cycle, and pentose phosphate pathway metabolites in one individual sampled eight times over five years and in 50 adults sampled 6 to 8 times each. In the single participant repeated measures, strong positive correlations were observed for most direct precursor-product pairs. The longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses reproduced these patterns. Precursor-product proportionality, a fundamental principle of enzymology, is detectable in LCMS datasets and remains consistent across studies. Applying these correlations to metabolomics workflows can improve pathway analysis, help metabolite identification, and reveal how genetic variations, diets, therapeutic drugs, and environmental exposures jointly impact metabolic pathways.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

We reconstructed 1011 cells, including syncytial neurons that form a nerve net. The syncytial neurons synapse on the balancer cells and also form reciprocal connections with the bridge cells that span the statocyst. High-speed imaging revealed that balancer cilia beat and arrest in a coordinated manner but with differences between the sagittal and tentacular planes of the animal, reflecting nerve-net organisation. Our results suggest a coordinating rather than sensory-motor function for the nerve net and inform our understanding of the diversity of nervous-system organisation across animals.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Anisotropic cell expansion in the roots longitudinal axis must be coordinated among adjacent cell files and throughout the radial axis. However, links between activities in these developmental axes remain obscure. We identified WALLFLOWER (WFL), a transmembrane receptor-like kinase that accumulates at the inner polar domain of epidermal cells in the root elongation zone. wfl mutant roots show deeper root waves and altered response to gravitropic re-orientation with increased cell length in specific epidermal cell files. wfl phenotypes are rescued by WFL-GFP, but not by an intracellular truncation of WFL, which unexpectedly accumulates at the opposite (outer) polar domain. This suggests WFL function and its localization to the inner lateral plasma membrane domain are tightly coupled. Using advanced imaging techniques, including lifetime and atomic force microscopy, we found several mechano-chemical aspects of the wfl outer and inner cell walls are altered consistent with a function for WFL in maintaining balanced mechanical properties between lateral cell walls during expansion. Overall, this work establishes a clear link between lateral protein polarization in peripheral tissues and longitudinal cell expansion required for adaptive organ growth.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Content-specific networks communicate with a domain-general, supramodal network that is recruited regardless of the type of content. Here, we contrasted visual and auditory working memory tasks to examine interactions between the supramodal network and two content-specific networks. Functional connectivity among visual-biased, auditory-biased, and supramodal working memory networks was assayed by collecting task and resting-state fMRI data from 24 human participants (age 18-43; 11 men and 13 women). At rest, as found previously, the supramodal network exhibited stronger functional connectivity with the visual-biased network than with the auditory-biased network. This asymmetry raises questions about how networks communicate to support robust performance across modalities. However, during auditory task performance, dynamic changes increased auditory network connectivity with supramodal and visual-biased frontal regions, while decreasing connectivity from posterior visual areas to supramodal and frontal visual regions. In contrast, the visual task produced weak changes. Across individuals, auditory working memory precision correlated with the strength of auditory network connectivity changes, while no such brain-behavior link was observed for visual working memory. These results demonstrate an asymmetry in working memory network organization and reveal that dynamic reorganization accompanies performance of working memory tasks.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Establishing a lineage-based viral targeting strategy in mice, we uncover that ETi massively amplifies and diversifies ETd projections across the cortex. Whereas ETd primarily targets the forebrain and midbrain, ETi dominates the hindbrain (e.g., brainstem/spinal action centers, lemniscal sensory stations), hypothalamic, and neuromodulatory regions with cortical area-specific projections. Numerous corticofugal subpopulations derive solely from iNG-ETi. Area-specific spinal projections of ETi but not ETd emerge from the postnatal pruning of an initial cortex-wide population. In the motor cortex, ETd or ETi activation induced distinct movements: either head-trunk, or additionally, coordinated orofacial-forelimb movements, respectively. Thus, two foundational neurogenic pathways with distinct evolutionary history differentially shape the area-specific diversification of cortical output channels.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

To address this, we developed SimSpace, a flexible simulation framework that can generate synthetic spatial cell maps with categorical cell type labels and biologically meaningful organization. Cell type spatial patterns are simulated using a Markov Random Field model, enabling the control of spatial autocorrelation and interaction between cell types. This approach captures a broad range of tissue architectures, from well-separated niches to spatially mixed environments. We evaluate the simulated data using spatial statistics metrics (eg. entropy, Moran's I) and benchmark the results against real spatial transcriptomics and proteomics datasets. Our findings show that the simulations closely mirror key spatial properties observed in biological tissues. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of our framework as a testbed for benchmarking spatial gene detection and cell type deconvolution methods.

We show that these insults remodel the developing cerebellum through distinct processes. Hx arrests granule cell maturation and reduces presynaptic excitatory input to Purkinje cells, whereas MIA perturbs granule cell migration and Purkinje dendritic development. Sequential MIA followed by Hx results in progressive neuronal mitochondrial damage and a reprogrammed circuit state.

We hypothesized HDGECs with depression history would show accelerated grey matter atrophy and disinhibition of striatal-to-default mode network connections over time. Methods: The study utilised the largest longitudinal study of premanifest HD, TrackOn-HD, including structural and resting-state brain scans. HDGECs were stratified by depression history and followed over three annual assessments. Analyses focused on 8 predefined regions spanning striatal and default mode network regions. Here, we applied spectral dynamic causal modelling to examine effective connectivity, alongside voxel-based morphometry of grey matter atrophy and linear mixed models of depressive symptoms. Spectral DCM employed Bayesian model reduction with free energy thresholds [&ge;]0.95 for strong evidence of connectivity changes. Results: The study included 105 HDGECs (53 females, mean age = 43, mean CAG = 43). Depression-related network dysconnection operated independently of regional grey matter atrophy, with HDGECs exhibiting widespread striatal volume loss but no differential atrophy patterns between depression groups. Larger posterior cingulate cortex volumes predicted increased depression severity specifically in HDGECs with depression history, across both Beck Depression Inventory-II ({beta} = 36.79, 95% CI = 2.33-71.25, p = .041) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression Subscale ({beta} = 27.31, 95% CI = 11.12-43.50, p = .002). Spectral dynamic causal models explained 88.6% of variance in depression groups and 90.4% in non-depression groups. Longitudinal effective connectivity analyses revealed distinct dysconnection profiles: HDGECs with depression history showed widespread interhemispheric alterations including progressive inhibitory changes of striatal-DMN circuits and aberrant hippocampal regulatory control, while those without depression exhibited more focal dysconnection. These patterns occurred despite no group differences in grey matter atrophy trajectories over 24 months. Discussion: Depression in HDGECs emerges through network dysconnection that operates independently of regional atrophy. Functional alterations may precede detectable structural breakdown and represent pathological responses to subclinical neurodegenerative processes, suggesting functional connectivity markers may serve as early indicators of depression vulnerability in premanifest HD.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Although the mechanisms of microbial pathogens in suppressing plant immunity have been well investigated, it remains unclear how herbivorous insects overcome receptor-mediated defenses. Here, we show that salivary effectors evolve independently in whiteflies and planthoppers to target defensive RLP4, therefore minimizing the plant immunity. RLP4, as a leucine-rich repeat RLP (LRR-RLP), confers plant resistance against herbivorous insects by forming the RLP4/SOBIR1 complexes. In the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, BtRDP, the Aleyrodidae-specific salivary sheath protein, interacts with RLP4 from multiple plant species and promotes its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Overexpression of NtRLP4 in transgenic plants exerts a detrimental impact on B. tabaci by exploiting the crosstalk between the salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) pathways. Conversely, overexpression of BtRDP or silencing of NtRLP4 effectively alleviates such negative effects. In planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, the Delphacidae-restricted salivary protein NlSP104 also targets and promotes the degradation of OsRLP4 from rice plants.

A key challenge for in vivo DW-SSFP is the sequence's severe motion sensitivity, currently limiting investigations to low or no motion regimes. Here we establish a framework to both (1) model and (2) correct for the impact of subject motion associated with the underlying magnetisation distribution of DW-SSFP. Theory and Methods: An extended phase graphs (EPG) representation of the 1D DW-SSFP signal was established incorporating a motion operator describing rigid body and pulsatile motion. The representation was validated using Monte Carlo simulations, and subsequently integrated into a data fitting routine for motion estimation and correction. The fitting routine was evaluated using both simulations and a voxelwise correction applied to in vivo experimental 2D low-resolution single-shot timeseries DW-SSFP data acquired in the human brain in three healthy volunteers, with a tensor reconstructed from the motion-corrected experimental DW-SSFP data. Results: The proposed EPG-motion framework gives excellent agreement to complementary Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating that diffusion coefficient estimation is robust over a range of motion and SNR regimes. Tensor estimates from the motion-corrected experimental DW-SSFP data give good visual agreement to complementary diffusion-weighted spin-echo (DW-SE) data acquired in the same subject, considerably reducing orientation-dependent motion-induced biases. Conclusion: Temporal information capturing the evolution of the DW-SSFP signal can be used to retrospectively (1) estimate subject motion and (2) reconstruct motion-corrected DW-SSFP data.

Species with longer than expected beaks relative to body size consistently exhibit distinct locomotor, prey-capture, and food-transport strategies.

Building on the SEA CDM, we developed the Ontology-based SEA Network (OSEAN) relational database and knowledge graph, along with a set of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and query tools, and further applied them to represent 1,278 immune studies with over two million samples from three resources: VIGET, ImmPort, and CELLxGENE. Using simple, robust queries and analyses, our research identified multiple scientific insights into sex-specific immune responses, such as neutrophil degranulation and TNF binding to physiological receptors, following live attenuated and trivalent inactivated influenza vaccination. The novel SEA CDM system lays a foundation for establishing an integrative biodata ecosystem across biological and biomedical domains.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

M.; Dridi, D.; Lasram, K.; Ben Abdeljalil, N.; Omezzine, A.; Boughattas, N. A.", "abstract": "Purpose: Ifosfamide (IFO) is an effective chimiotherapeutic agent for sarcomas and germ-cell tumors but its clinical use is limited by severe toxicities, particularly hemorrhagic cystitis and encephalopathy. We recently demonstrated that IFO displays a circadian rhythm of lethal toxicity at LD50, with survival, body weight loss and core temperature strongly dependent on dosing time (Chennoufi MM & Boughattas NA, 2025). That study established the presence of an intrinsic chronotolerance rhythm, but lethality prevented organ-specific analyses. Here, we extend this work by assessing whether sublethal IFO exposure (LD30). Methods: 160 male Swiss albinos mice were synchronized to a 12:12 h light/dark cycle. IFO LD30 was administered at four circadian times: 1, 7, 13, and 19 Hours After Light Onset (HALO). Endpoints included hematology, hepatic enzymes, histopathology (brain, liver, kidney, and bladder) and neurobehavioral function. Organ-specific chronotoxicity patterns were compared to the LD50 chronotolerance rhythm previously reported. Results: Marked circadian rhythms were observed across all endpoints. Dosing at 7 HALO induced the most severe overall toxicity, while administration at 13 HALO significantly reduced hepatic, renal, and bladder injury, encephalopathy-related lesions appeared only at 19 HALO. Hematological suppression and hepatic enzyme elevations also varied by dosing time, with lowest toxicity consistently at 13 HALO. Neurobehavioral impairment followed the same pattern. The optimal tolerance window overlapped with the LD50 peak tolerance found in our earlier study. Conclusion: Sublethal IFO toxicity is strongly time-of-day dependent. Administration at 13 HALO (early active phase) minimizes brain and multi-organ injury and aligns with the chronotolerance peak previously defined at LD50. These complementary findings support the development of circadian-based IFO chronotherapy to improve clinical safety.

This study investigates whether white matter microstructural parameters of the arcuate fasciculus and corpus callosum is associated with cognitive performance across distinct language lateralisation groups. Neuroimaging and cognitive data from 279 healthy adults were sourced from the BIL&GIN database. Participants completed a sentence production fMRI task, diffusion MRI, and cognitive tasks assessing verbal, visuospatial, and arithmetic skills. Significant positive associations were observed in strongly atypical individuals between fractional anisotropy in the splenium and working memory (R2 = 0.96, pFDR = 0.042) and between FA in the genu and visuospatial attention (R2 = 0.92, pFDR = 0.042). ANCOVA revealed that cross-dominant individuals had significantly lower visuospatial attention scores compared to consistently lateralised individuals (pFDR = 0.02). These findings challenge the notion that atypical lateralisation is inherently maladaptive and suggest that white matter pathways may serve as an alternative mechanism for supporting cognitive function in individuals with rightward language dominance. Furthermore, the results highlight the cognitive disadvantages of crossed dominance, implicating disrupted interhemispheric communication as a potential underlying mechanism.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

P.; Rubiano-Buitrago, P.", "abstract": "In classic coevolutionary interactions, host plants are thought to accrue novel chemical defenses which are later countered by detoxification strategies and sometimes sequestration in specialist herbivores. We recently discovered that unusual nitrogen- and sulfur-containing (N,S-) cardenolides in some milkweed species are highly toxic, and broken down to less toxic forms which are sequestered by monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus). Here we isolated and purified five dominant cardenolide toxins from the tropical milkweed, Asclepias curassavica, a globally abundant host plant of monarchs, and fed them to caterpillars individually or in mixture. We hypothesized that the two N,S-cardenolides in A. curassavica (uscharin and voruscharin) would reduce caterpillar growth and sequestration more than other abundant related cardenolides (15-Hydroxy calotropin, frugoside, calactin). Overall, cardenolide treatments caused monarchs to feed more and grow more compared to controls; nonetheless, one N,S-cardenolide (voruscharin) was not stimulatory and caused substantial reductions in growth efficiency. Consuming N,S-cardenolides caused caterpillars to sequester the lowest total amounts of cardenolides, and also reduced their efficiency of sequestration. We next tested the phytochemical diversity hypothesis, that toxin mixtures pose a substantial burden for caterpillars compared to individual compounds provided in equimolar concentrations. We prepared two types of mixtures, one containing equal concentrations of the five compounds and another \"realistic mixture\" where toxin concentrations reflect their natural proportions in leaves. Mixtures had a negative impact on caterpillar feeding, growth, sequestration, and sequestration efficiency compared to the average of single compounds. The equal and realistic mixtures had similar impacts on feeding and growth, but feeding on the realistic mixture resulted in the lowest sequestration. We conclude that as a result of coevolutionary interactions, even sequestering herbivores may be thwarted by highly specialized plant metabolites such as N,S-cardenolides, and that phytochemical mixtures strengthen plant defense. Toxin mixtures likely challenge detoxification and transport of plant defenses, reducing the herbivores growth and sequestration.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Our goal is to enable this in vitro testing by creating a benchtop system that is accessible, easy-to-use, and functions reliably across academic and industry environments, reducing discordant results that arise from discordant approaches. Furthermore, such a system paves the way for standardizing benchtop characterization of future implantable systems by establishing a repeatable and comparable methodology for validating these devices and their capabilities. Approach: We describe the NeuroTest Board (NTB), a low-cost, open-source device that combines a low-noise current source waveform generator with a high-precision data acquisition system. We provide information on its architecture, operation, and performance as an initial benchmark of the potential capabilities of the system. Main results: We demonstrate the use of the NTB to assess electrophysiology systems in two separate applications. In one case, we assess a commonly used laboratory system (the RHD2132 headstage and Open Ephys data acquisition system), while the second case characterizes an investigational neuromodulation device in development for human use (the CorTec Brain InterChange). Following this initial sensing characterization, we explore stimulation-related artifacts that would hamper in vivo data collection. With the NTB, we develop and evaluate artifact mitigation strategies for each system, thus demonstrating an example application of this benchtop testbed.

For instance, directionally biased hand and eye movements can express simple visuo-spatial features during WM maintenance. If such sensorimotor inflections are a form of WM representation, they may also express more multifaceted and task-adaptive information than just spatial location. Here, we ask whether gaze patterns carry item-specific detail about complex stimuli held in mind, and whether gaze prospectively adapts to the behavioral task demands. To do this, we tracked human eye movements (male and female) during WM for naturalistic images, and we manipulated which image features were most taskrelevant (visual or semantic). In two experiments, we found that the eyes moved in complex, item-specific spatiotemporal sequences during WM maintenance. Delay period gaze patterns retraced the scanpaths from stimulus encoding, echoing the 'gaze reinstatement' that aligns with neural pattern reactivation during long-term memory retrieval. Therefore, gaze patterns during WM may reinstate visual encoding processes for maintenance. We also used time-resolved representational similarity analyses, guided by convolutional neural network modeling, to test the specificity of WM gaze patterns across a trial. We found that gaze representations were more distinct when the task prioritized visual detail, and also ramped up in anticipation of the WM probe. Therefore, oculomotor WM signals are malleable to when and how the content will be used. These results suggest that the earliest levels of visual processing reflect prospectively-oriented and functionally flexible WM content representations.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

This is due in part to the lack mouse models that develop robust CAA, hampering our ability to develop therapies that target vascular deficits. To address this, we have explored the use of distinct genetic contexts to enhance the face validity of mouse models for AD. We have previously identified the WSB/EiJ (WSB) strain as a model that shows increased susceptibility to CAA in the presence of the APP/PS1 amyloid driver, compared to the commonly used C57BL/6J (B6) strain. Here, we now perform an in-depth characterization of WSB.APP/PS1 and its WSB wild type (WT) counterpart, assessing male and female mice, at 4, 8, and 12 months of age (M). We show that WSB.APP/PS1 mice show mild CAA at 8M, with robust CAA being apparent at 14M. Transcriptional profiling showed strong correlation to AMP-AD gene expression modules highlighting the human relevance of WSB.APP/PS1 mice and predicted white matter deficits at 14M that was confirmed by immunofluorescence. PET/CT showed blood flow and metabolic deficits, and modifications in small vessel morphology in 8M WSB.APP/PS1 compared to WSB WT mice. We tested whether cerebrovascular reactivity deficits in WSB WT mice may underly the susceptibility to CAA, but interestingly, they did not show age-dependent decline in reactivity that was observed in B6 mice.

Chronic stress can cause structural alterations like grey matter atrophy in key emotion-related areas such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). To identify biological pathways affected by chronic stress in the PFC, researchers have performed transcriptional profiling (RNA-sequencing, microarray) to measure gene expression in rodent models. However, transcriptional signatures in the PFC that are shared across different chronic stress paradigms and laboratories remain relatively unexplored.\n\nMethodsWe performed a meta-analysis of publicly available transcriptional profiling datasets within the Gemma database. We identified six datasets that characterized the effects of either chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) or chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) on gene expression in the PFC in mice (n=117). We fit a random effects meta-analysis model to the chronic stress effect sizes (log(2) fold changes) for each transcript (n=21,379) measured in most datasets. We then compared our results with two other published chronic stress meta-analyses, as well as transcriptional signatures associated with psychiatric disorders.\n\nResultsWe identified 133 genes that were consistently differentially expressed across chronic stress studies and paradigms (false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05). Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (fGSEA) revealed 53 gene sets enriched with differential expression (FDR<0.05), dominated by glial and neurovascular markers (e.g., oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, endothelial/vascular) and stress-related signatures (e.g., major depressive disorder, hormonal responses). Immediate-early gene markers of neuronal activity (Fos, Junb, Arc, Dusp1) were consistently suppressed. Many of the identified effects resembled those seen in previous meta-analyses characterizing stress effects (CSDS, early life stress), despite minimal overlap in included samples. Moreover, some effects resembled previous observations from psychiatric disorders, including alcohol abuse disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia.\n\nConclusionOur study demonstrates that chronic stress induces a robust, cross-paradigm PFC signature characterized by down-regulation of glia/myelin and vascular pathways and suppression of immediate-early gene activity, highlighting cellular processes linking chronic stress exposure, PFC dysfunction, and psychiatric disorders.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=92 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/683091v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@df9f36org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14db279org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4c8eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a22ccb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Key PointsO_LIChronic stress is linked to many human psychiatric disorders involving the prefrontal cortex (PFC).\nC_LIO_LIMeta-analysis showed that stressed mice had less gene expression for glia and neural activity in the PFC.\nC_LIO_LIPFC gene expression in chronically stressed mice mirrors patterns seen in psychiatric patients.\nC_LI\n\nPlain Language SummaryChronic stress has been shown to have lasting effects on the brain, contributing to cognitive impairments and the risk of psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The prefrontal cortex, a brain region that is important for behavioral and attentional control, is sensitive to chronic stress. We combined information from six public mouse datasets to identify consistent effects of chronic stress on gene expression (mRNA) in the prefrontal cortex. In these studies, mice that had experienced chronic stress showed a decreased amount of mRNA related to a variety of non-neuronal support cells (glia) and blood vessels, and general neural activity.

However, temperature, via its influence on reaction kinetics, may act as a confounder in studies that measure genomic signatures of growth optimization across environments by decoupling the cellular optimization for relatively fast growth from absolute growth rates. Observations suggest that growth optimization need not always indicate rapid growth. For example, strong temperature gradients are the norm across much of the world's oceans, where slow-growing deep-ocean microbes show elevated signals of genomic growth optimization relative to the faster-growing communities at the surface. Looking across environments, we find a negative relationship between genomic growth optimization and optimal growth temperature, indicating the potential decoupling of genomic traits associated with copiotrophy from maximum growth rate, particularly when measured in the presence of a strong temperature gradient. Our results suggest that, as a result of temperature's confounding effects, genomic signatures of growth optimization better predict the ecological roles and functional genomic content of microorganisms than do growth rates themselves.

One of the major challenges in studying bacterial pathogenesis in larvae is the limited availability of healthy larvae throughout the year. This seasonal constraint delays testing and impedes progress in understanding bacterial infections, disease management, and the development of effective treatments for bivalve aquaculture. To address this challenge, a hemocyte viability assay based on the resazurin assay was developed as an alternative for testing bacterial pathogenesis. The assay was optimized using eastern oyster hemocytes, and the lethal concentration (LC)50 values of a well-known bacterial pathogen of larvae (Vibrio coralliilyticus RE22) (107 {+/-} 22 multiplicity of infection (MOI)), a probiont (Phaeobacter inhibens S4) (2157 {+/-} 167 MOI), and several bacterial isolates from shellfish hatcheries were determined. The most virulent isolates had an LC50 ranging from 53 to 195 MOI, indicating high pathogenicity. To validate the assay, the isolates were tested on oyster larvae, confirming that bacterial isolates with low LC50 (<200 MOI) caused significant larval mortality, while other isolates exhibiting LC50 values ranging from 690 to 25389 MOI showed no adverse effect on the oyster larvae. This high-throughput hemocyte viability assay provides a reliable and less time-consuming alternative to larval assays, particularly during the off-season, facilitating year-round research on bacterial pathogenicity in bivalves.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

PKM{zeta}, a persistently active atypical PKC (aPKC), is thought to be crucial for maintaining the late phase of long-term potentiation (late-LTP) and long-term memory through sustained kinase action. However, hippocampal LTP and spatial memory, but not neocortical LTP, are expressed in PKM{zeta}-knockout mice, calling into question whether persistent kinases and PKM{zeta} are fundamental to LTP and memory. In Tsokas et al., 2016, we showed PKC{iota}/{lambda}, the other aPKC, becomes persistently active in PKM{zeta}-knockout mice. In wild-type mice, PKC{iota}/{lambda} is critical to the initial generation of early-LTP and short-term memory, and PKM{zeta} compensates for genetic deletion of PKC{iota}/{lambda} by supporting both early- and late-phase processes. Here, we tested whether PKC{iota}/{lambda} compensates for the loss of PKM{zeta} by genetically ablating both aPKCs.

The aPKC-inhibitor ZIP that disrupts enduring wild-type- and PKM{zeta}-null-LTP, has no effect on the residual, transient {iota}/{zeta}-double-knockout-LTP, indicating ZIP suppresses LTP's late phase by targeting aPKC. Hippocampal {iota}/{zeta}-double-knockout eliminates spatial long-term memory but not short-term memory. Thus, in the absence of PKM{zeta}, a second persistent biochemical process compensates to sustain late-LTP and long-term memory.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

N.; Brogna, S.", "abstract": "Nonsense mutations are often associated with reduced mRNA levels, as premature translation termination can lead to the activation of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). To examine how positional context influences these outcomes, we introduced premature translation termination codons (PTCs) at 15 locations within the coding region of a GFP reporter gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. PTCs in the first third of the coding region (codons 1-88) consistently led to reduced mRNA levels. In contrast, most downstream PTCs (codons 108-231) showed modest or minimal reductions, and several were associated with increased mRNA levels relative to the PTC-less control transcript. Measurement of transcript stability for one such variant indicated that the increased abundance was not attributable to decreased turnover. Deletion of UPF1 in wild-type cells elevated the levels of transcripts that were reduced and, unexpectedly, further increased the abundance of transcripts that exceeded the control level. In spliced versions of these constructs, downstream PTCs generally reduced mRNA levels regardless of exon junction position; additionally, for some early PTCs, splicing appeared to suppress rather than enhance mRNA reduction. Overall, these observations indicate that an unexpected consequence of nonsense mutations can be increased mRNA levels. These findings may aid in the interpretation of the effects of nonsense mutations on mRNA abundance beyond the predictions of current NMD models and may also help in the design of eukaryotic gene-expression constructs.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Given its conserved sequence across coronaviruses and its essential role in viral replication, numerous inhibitors have been developed to target its active site. Mpro exists in equilibrium between the active dimer and inactive monomer, rendering the targeting of dimerization as a promising alternative strategy for drug development. This study addresses knowledge gaps regarding the monomer-dimer equilibrium and conformational changes of Mpro induced by inhibitor binding. We utilized 13C labeling combined with native mass spectrometry to assess how different types of inhibitors (including peptidomimetic inhibitors PF-07321332, PF-00835231, GC376, boceprevir; non-peptidomimetic inhibitors carmofur, ebselen and its analog MR6-31-2; and allosteric inhibitors AT7519 and pelitinib) influence the monomer-dimer equilibrium and subunit exchange of Mpro. Additionally, we employed hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to investigate the conformational dynamics of Mpro and its interactions with these inhibitors. Key findings revealed divergent mechanisms: peptidomimetic inhibitors significantly shifted the equilibrium towards the dimeric state, suppressing subunit exchange dynamics and rigidifying the dimer interface. In contrast, ebselen impaired the dimer form and increased the flexibility of the dimer interface. Notably, we identified a novel covalent binding site for ebselen at C300 by tandem mass spectrometry, with molecular dynamics simulations further indicating that this modification allosterically altered the hydrogen bond network of the Mpro dimer interface. Overall, this study reveals distinct inhibitory modes between peptidomimetic inhibitors and ebselen, highlighting the potential of targeting allosteric sites at the dimer interface for the design of next-generation Mpro inhibitors.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

While co-divergence and host-switching have been extensively explored in systems, such as Wolbachia-arthropod symbioses or viruses infecting vertebrates, similar investigations in protistan parasites remain scarce. The Leishmania-Leishmaniavirus (LRV) association offers a rare opportunity to study co-divergence in a medically relevant symbiotic system, in which the virus modulates the parasitic disease severity in humans. Here, we used total RNA sequencing to capture both the Leishmania transcriptome and the LRV genome simultaneously, enabling the first comprehensive investigation of the co-evolutionary history of Leishmania and LRV across different hierarchical levels (subgenus, species, and population). We found significant positive correlations between the parasite and viral genetic distances at both the subgenus (R2 = 0.89; F = 10,913.49; p < 0.001) and species level (focusing on L. (Viannia) spp.; R2 = 0.59; F = 1,254; p < 0.001). This was corroborated by additional co-phylogenetic methods (global-fit and event-based), indicating a strong pattern of phylogenetic congruence between Leishmania and LRV up to the species level. Only at the population level, focusing on the interactions of L. (V.) braziliensis and L. (V.) guyanensis with LRV1, we found weaker co-phylogenetic signals accompanied by more instances of intraspecific host switching. Overall and for the first time, our findings provide analytical evidence for the co-evolution between Leishmania and LRV, with co-speciation as the predominant process, while also shedding light on how such symbioses were maintained over long evolutionary time scales.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Thioredoxin domain containing 5 (TXNDC5), a member of the protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) family, regulates protein folding and vascular homeostasis, yet its role in PH remains unknown. METHODS: Label-free proteomics was used to profile PDI expression in hypoxic PH patients. TXNDC5 expression and localization were examined by multiplex immunofluorescence and Western blot. Gain- and loss-of-function approaches, including adeno-associated virus-mediated lung endothelial overexpression, global knockout, and endothelial ablation of TXNDC5, were used in Sugen5416/hypoxia (SuHx)-induced rodent PH models. In vitro endothelial cell assays, RNA sequencing, protein-protein interaction analysis, and pharmacological intervention were conducted to elucidate underlying mechanisms and therapeutic potential. RESULTS: TXNDC5 was significantly upregulated in the lungs of both PH patients and experimental PH models, predominantly in endothelial cells of remodeled distal pulmonary arteries. Endothelial TXNDC5 overexpression exacerbated pulmonary vascular remodeling, elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, and promoted right ventricular hypertrophy, whereas global or endothelial-specific TXNDC5 deficiency conferred protection against SuHx-induced PH. RNA sequencing and protein-protein interaction analysis revealed that TXNDC5 regulated extracellular matrix homeostasis through biglycan (BGN), which was required for TXNDC5-mediated inhibition of HIF-1/2 ubiquitination, leading to pathological HIF accumulation. Pharmacological inhibition of TXNDC5 with E64FC26 and endothelial-targeted TXNDC5 gene therapy significantly attenuated PH severity in SuHx rats. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that TXNDC5 is a main modulator to regulate ECM homeostasis and may serve as a promising target for the treatment of PH.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Classical forward genetics has defined essential genes for phage replication in a few model systems but remains laborious and non-scalable. Unbiased functional genomics approaches are therefore needed for phages, particularly for large lytic phages. Here, we develop a phage transposon sequencing (TnSeq) platform that uses the mariner transposase to insert an anti-CRISPR selectable marker into phage genomes. CRISPR-Cas13a-based enrichment of transposed phages followed by pooled sequencing identifies both fitness-conferring and dispensable genes. Using the Pseudomonas aeruginosa-infecting nucleus-forming jumbo phage {Phi}KZ (280,334 bp; 371 predicted genes) as a model, we show that ~110 genes are fitness-conferring via phage TnSeq. These include conserved essential genes involved in phage nucleus formation, protein trafficking, transcription, DNA replication, and virion assembly. We also isolate hundreds of individual phages with insertions in non-essential genes and reveal conditionally essential genes that are specifically required in clinical isolates, at environmental temperature, or in the presence of a defensive nuclease. Phage TnSeq is a facile, scalable technology that can define essential phage genes and generate knockouts in all non-essential genes in a single experiment, enabling conditional genetic screens in phages and providing a broadly applicable resource for phage functional genomics.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Nowadays, despite multi-locus phylogenomic approaches dominate, SSU rRNA sequences still serves as a molecular identifier of biodiversity. Phylogenetic placement uses a reference phylogeny and a given evolutionary model to annotate taxonomically environmental DNA. As such, it enables more accurate identification of divergent sequences that may belong to unknown lineages across the Tree of Life. Here we first created the largest dataset of 18S sequences belonging to non-Bilateria metazoans, by curating the sequences found in PR2 database. We then used it as a case study to test the performance of different 18S-based barcodes (V4, V9, and full-length 18S) within a phylogenetic placement framework. Employing a series of sensitivity analyses, we found that the V9 region generally lacks sufficient phylogenetic signal for reliable placements in most of the cases. The V4 region is accurate when the environmental diversity is well represented in the reference tree but struggles with divergent lineages. Full-length 18S overcome short-read limitations and emerges as the most robust option to uncover unknown major clades. Finally, we apply phylogenetic placement to empirical environmental 18S data. We observe geographical variation in non-bilaterians communities and recover a putative clade of early-branching Ctenophora based on long-sequence barcodes.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Given the challenges in estimating biomolecule dynamics with cryoEM alone, MD simulations are often employed to forecast molecular motions and to interpret cryoEM reconstructions. Few methods, however, can evaluate MD predictions directly. Here, we use multislice wave propagation to project sampled snapshots of MD trajectories, either coarse-grained (CG) or all-atom (AA), into simulated cryoEM 3D reconstructions. We compared simulated and experimental images of low and high-curvature membranes to show that MD simulations qualitatively reflect the fluidity and thus the contrast of biological membranes observed by cryoEM. MD simulations also correctly predicted bilayer dimensions for single component flat bilayers observed in cryoEM images. However, Martini3 CG-MD simulations failed to predict changes in membrane thickness induced by high curvature and with heterogeneous lipid compositions. We pinpointed the misbehavior of polyunsaturated lipid tails and cholesterol in Martini3 simulations as the main sources of error contributing to inaccurate bilayer thicknesses. Our comparisons also explain membrane structure discrepancies between cryoEM and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Further testing of MD predictions by direct comparisons between simulated and experimental cryoEM images should lead to the development of more accurate MD force fields.\n\nStatement of SignificanceMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations are frequently employed to predict the dynamics of biological macromolecules and assemblies, but these predictions remain difficult to validate experimentally. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) can be used to directly image the conformational ensemble of macromolecules, but images of Coulombic potential cannot be easily compared to snapshots of atoms from MD simulations. Here, we show that a physics-based multislice image simulation algorithm accurately converts MD trajectories to simulated cryoEM 2D images and 3D reconstructions. Using this approach, we identify consistencies and discrepancies between MD simulations and cryoEM experiments.

These differential interactions showed coordinated changes in chromatin state and gene expression, with stronger interactions associated with increased accessibility and transcription. Notably, loci regulated in trans exhibited a unique chromatin signature where weaker interactions were enriched for H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. Analysis of F1 hybrids revealed dominant repressive effects, consistent with heterochromatin-mediated trans-regulation. To causally test this mechanism, we generated reciprocal congenic mouse strains carrying a Chr13 trans-QTL region. Integrated multiomic profiling of congenic ESC lines demonstrated that this single locus coordinates changes in H3K9me3, H3K27ac, chromatin accessibility, and 3D contact frequency at hundreds of distal targets.

These oscillations could arise from circadian clock control of metabolic pathways in peripheral tissues, or secondary to rhythmic food intake, which is primarily controlled by central circadian clocks in the brain. To determine the relative contribution of central and peripheral clocks and behavioral cycles to metabolic rhythms in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we conducted large-scale metabolite profiling with fine temporal resolution across multiple days in control flies with intact molecular clocks and in flies in which we used the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to specifically eliminate molecular circadian clock function in the fat body, a peripheral metabolic tissue, or the brain. As these latter flies lack feeding rhythms due to central circadian clock dysfunction, we also included an experimental cohort of flies lacking central brain clocks but subjected to time-restricted feeding (TRF) protocols to impose feeding rhythms. Single-nuclei RNA sequencing confirmed selective molecular clock elimination following fat body manipulations, which was associated with predicted alterations in clock gene expression and an attenuation of time-of-day differences in the abundance of fat body transcripts involved in key metabolic pathways. Interestingly, we identified few rhythmically expressed metabolites in flies that were allowed ad libitum food access, and rhythms of metabolite abundance were not drastically altered by tissue-specific molecular clock disruption. In contrast, we found that flies lacking brain clocks but raised on TRF exhibited a profound increase in cyclic metabolites. These findings suggest that whole-body metabolic rhythms in Drosophila are more strongly regulated by feeding cycles than by direct circadian clock control of metabolic pathways despite the presence of metabolic genes that exhibit local-clock dependent modulation of expression across the day.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Here we characterize a deeply conserved microexon E35a in Ank3 encoding ankyrin-G (AnkG), a multifaceted adaptor protein best known as a master organizer of the axon initial segment (AIS) and as a leading genetic risk factor for bipolar disorder. E35a is predominantly skipped in cortical glutamatergic neurons but included in cortical GABAergic neurons and cerebellar neurons, which is dictated by multiple neuronal splicing factors. In E35a-deletion mice we generated, interneurons show increased excitability and somatic Ca2+ activity, without disruption in AIS. Biochemical analyses suggest that E35a inclusion facilitates AnkG interaction with a protein complex involving inositol trisphosphate receptors (InsP3Rs) important for intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Alternative splicing therefore allows AnkG to modulate neuron type-specific excitability in addition to its ubiquitous pan-neuronal role in organizing the AIS.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Harnessing such information to induce regeneration in a non-regenerative setting has been a long-sought goal. The amputated salamander limb efficiently regenerates all of its missing bones, but paradoxically, a large bone gap without amputation - commonly called a Critical Size Defect (CSD) - is not regenerated, similarly to other vertebrates [Chen et al., 2015]. This non-regenerating injury provides a human-relevant setting to understand how to rescue lack-of-regeneration. Satoh and colleagues demonstrated in axolotl that transplantation of blastema cells from an amputated limb into a CSD yields cartilage bridging of the CSD [Satoh et al., 2010]. This work provided a roadmap for rescuing the CSD. Here we asked, what are the crucial molecular differences in cells populating a regenerating blastema versus the CSD and can they be used to elicit CSD bridging? Previous genetic fate mapping and single cell transcriptomics showed that limb regeneration occurs via migration and dedifferentiation of fibroblastic, soft connective tissue (CT) cells that form a multipotent, skeletal stem cell [Currie et al, 2016, Gerber et al, 2018]. Here using single cell transcriptomics and genetic fate mapping we found that the CSD is populated by CT cells that undergo a divergent molecular transition compared to the blastema. Using gene regulatory network (GRN) modeling, and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery of mRNA we could express a single molecular factor, Wnt3a, to induce cartilage bridging of the CSD. Our results demonstrate the power of using molecular information from successful regeneration to rescue a non-regenerating injury.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

A central challenge is identifying ideal T-cell populations that effectively eliminate tumors without causing off-target damage, a distinction not captured by existing biomarkers. We show that co-expression patterns of chemokine receptors (CRs) CXCR3, CCR5, and CXCR6 on CD8+ T cells provide a functional \"code\" defining subsets with divergent roles in on-target immunity versus off-target inflammation. In mouse and human melanoma, a triple-positive (CXCR3+CCR5+CXCR6+) T-cell subset is essential for tumor control, and its genetic signature correlates with positive clinical response, while a distinct CCR5+CXCR6+ subset drives liver immune-related adverse events (IRAEs). Crucially, this CR code reveals that immunotherapy actively reshapes T-cell trafficking patterns, uncovering profound heterogeneity within conventional populations and distinguishing potent anti-tumor progenitors from cells predisposed to exhaustion or off-target migration.

Here, we present a comprehensive validation and verification study of compounds identified through two computational approaches: Literature Wide Association Studies (LWAS) and Gene Reversal Rate (GRR), using orthogonal cell viability assays in 2D models across IBC and non-IBC cell lines. In the SUM149 IBC cell line, repurposed compounds predicted from LWAS achieved a 70% success rate, with several showing nanomolar potency, while those predicted from GRR showed a 38% success rate. Through systematic combination screening in both 2D and 3D-spheroid models, we identified novel synergistic compound pairs targeting crosstalk between IGF1-R, EGFR and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways, with high synergy scores across multiple reference models. Using these combinations, western blotting analysis revealed significant suppression in the phosphorylation of key signaling proteins and downstream effectors, while wound healing assays demonstrated reduced cell migration for some combinations, suggesting effective pathway inhibition. To further validate these findings at the transcriptional level, RNA-Seq analysis in SUM149 cells confirmed that the GRR drug combinations significantly reversed the IBC gene expression signature (IBC-GES). These findings not only validated our computational predictions but also identified promising combination strategies that could potentially overcome drug resistance in IBC.

While primary motor cortices exhibit clear somatotopic organization, it is unclear whether this segregation extends to the higher-order networks governing skilled actions. Furthermore, the dissociation between verbal (apraxia of speech, AOS) and non-verbal (buccofacial apraxia, BFA) oral motor control remains debated. We investigated the neuroanatomical substrates of limb apraxia (LA), BFA, and AOS in 136 patients with acute left-hemisphere ischemic stroke using voxel-based, region-of-interest-based, and connectome-based lesion-symptom mapping. Our results revealed a fundamental anatomical dissociation extending beyond simple effector specificity. LA was associated with damage to the inferior parietal lobule and widespread white matter disconnections, specifically involving intra-hemispheric temporo-parietal pathways and massive inter-hemispheric transcallosal fibers. In contrast, BFA was attributable to focal cortical lesions centered on the ventral precentral and postcentral gyri, without significant involvement of long-range white matter tracts. AOS showed no significant lesion overlap at the population level, suggesting a heterogenous etiology distinct from the premotor patterns of BFA. These findings indicate that LA and BFA differ not only in their effectors but in their network dependency: LA relies on a distributed, bilaterally integrated temporo-parietal network for multimodal action control, whereas BFA depends on localized proprioceptive-motor loops in the ventral sensorimotor cortex. This study provides a structural framework for the hierarchical organization of human praxis, distinguishing between distributed network disconnections and focal cortical dysfunctions.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

M.; Ruiz-Losada, M.; Azpiazu, N.; Morata, G.", "abstract": "Transition toward senescence is a cellular response to different stressors like ionizing radiation, telomere shortening or oncogene activation. This phenomenon is evolutionarily conserved across species, from insects to humans. Senescent cells (SCs) permanently withdraw from the cell cycle and undergo a series of physiological changes, most notably the acquisition of a robust secretory activity characterized by the release of numerous molecules, including cytokines, chemokines, and metalloproteinases. Through this program, termed Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), SCs actively communicate with and influence their microenvironment. In mammalian tissues the number of SCs increases with age and their accumulation has been proposed to contribute to several age-associated pathologies. Studies in vertebrate systems have demonstrated that new SCs can arise through paracrine signaling from pre-existing SCs, a process that requires the activity of Transforming Growth Factor {beta} (TGF-{beta}). We have investigated the phenomenon of paracrine recruitment of SCs in the Drosophila wing disc. Our results show that an initial stress event induces a primary wave of SCs, comprising approximately 10% of the target cell population. Subsequently, a second wave of SCs emerges through paracrine signaling from the initial cohort, increasing the overall proportion of SCs to about 24%. The formation of this second wave is mediated by the growth factor Decapentaplegic (Dpp), the Drosophila ortholog of TGF-{beta}. Dpp activates a non-canonical signaling route in non-SCs, driving their conversion to a senescent state. This novel branch of the Dpp pathway engages several components of the innate immune response. Collectively, these findings underscore the evolutionary conservation of senescence-associated signaling networks and suggest that paracrine amplification of senescence may play a role in tumorigenesis and age-related diseases.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Even though these differences are virtually absent underwater, fish are still able to sense sound direction. In 1975, Arie Schuijf proposed that this ability could arise from a comparison of the particle motion phase and the pressure phase of sound, a prediction which was recently confirmed experimentally for near-field sounds. In natural environments, however, sounds arrive from variable distances, altering the motion-pressure phase relationship. Thus, directional hearing and distance hearing are potentially at conflict. There is currently neither a model nor experimental data for how fish deal with this complexity. Here, we systematically introduce phase differences to the particle motion and pressure components of sound pulses to quantify the directional tuning of startle responses in Danionella cerebrum. We find that the fishs directed startle behavior is both frequency and distance dependent, and introduce a new model that explains how this tuning can emerge from fish anatomy. This framework quantitatively predicts the sensorimotor transformation across all observed stimuli and likely extends to other otophysan fishes with evolutionarily conserved hearing apparatus, representing [~]15% of all vertebrate species.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=199 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/693757v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (57K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@183c937org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10f544dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16793fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1244682_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Textured flicker composed of Gabor patches has been proposed as a more comfortable alternative, but its suitability for SSVEP paradigms and its frequency-dependent impact on neural entrainment remain unclear. Here, we directly compared textured Gabor-based flicker and classical luminance flicker using a frequency sweep followed by a multi-class SSVEP BCI task. In Session 1 (N=24), we measured SSVEP signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), inter-trial coherence (ITC), and subjective comfort across 13 stimulation frequencies (3-18Hz). Gabor-based textures elicited higher SNR and ITC than plain flicker at low frequencies (3-9Hz), whereas plain flicker produced stronger and more phase-consistent responses at higher frequencies (12-18Hz), revealing a robust crossover in entrainment. Across almost all frequencies, Gabor stimuli were rated as more comfortable. Based on these results, we defined a low-frequency Gabor-optimized band (5-7Hz) and a higher plain-optimized band (14-16Hz). In Session 2 (N=18), these bands were used in a five-class offline SSVEP BCI. Classification accuracy was highest (Gabor: 95.7% at 5-7Hz; plain: 98.1% at 14-16Hz) when each stimulus type was used in its optimal band and decreased markedly when stimulus type and frequency band were mismatched.

Although extensively studied in vertebrates, ageing in long-lived invertebrates remains comparatively unexplored. While ageing typically leads to greater susceptibility to infectious diseases, a striking and unexpected reversal was identified in oysters: older oysters exhibit markedly increased tolerance to the Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS), a panzootic disease primarily driven by the OsHV-1 herpesvirus and responsible for severe losses in global aquaculture. To investigate this counterintuitive pattern, we challenged oysters aged 4, 16, and 28 months from four biparental families and conducted an integrative multi-omics analysis, including epigenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics on the two families showing the strongest age-related increase in survival. Our results reveal that ageing in Magallana gigas is characterized by coordinated epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic reprogramming that reduces host permissiveness to POMS. We show that the epigenetic remodeling of key immune regulators (e.g., Toll-like receptors, MyD88) aligns with transcriptional rewiring of NF-{kappa}B and ubiquitin pathways, producing a finely tuned innate immune state marked by enhanced antiviral activity but reduced antibacterial responsiveness. We also identify age-related repression of mTOR signaling, likely promoting autophagy and improving viral control. These regulatory changes are tightly linked to metabolic adjustments, including reduced TCA cycle flux, remodeled nitrogen metabolism, and altered glutathione dynamics, which collectively support a stress-tolerant, energy-conserving phenotype.

Human participants attend to a 3-note melody in one pitch range presented to one ear while ignoring a competing, interleaved melody in a different pitch range played to the other ear (Laffere et al., 2020, 2021). The melodies consist of pitch-evoking pseudo-tones formed by convolving a periodic impulse train with a brief tone pip. These stimuli allow us to measure both ABRs (elicited by each individual tone pip within a pseudo-note) and cortical responses (elicited by the onsets of pseudo-notes) simultaneously. We observed robust ABRs, but no evidence of modulation by attention. Conversely, cortical responses, measured by event related potentials (ERPs), demonstrated attentional modulation of the P1-N1 peak.

Here, we found that NL2 plays a non-redundant essential role in astrocyte morphogenesis. Through structure and function studies, we identified a WW-binding motif within the NL2 intracellular domain required for astrocyte morphogenesis. Using cell-specific in vivo proximity labeling by biotinylation (iBioID), we found that each NL displays distinct protein-protein interactions within astrocytes, and NL2 has cell-type specific interactomes in astrocytes versus neurons. By leveraging this interactome, we conducted in vitro and in vivo candidate screens and identified WW domain-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4l to control astrocyte morphogenesis. Biochemical assays revealed that Nedd4l ubiquitinates and stabilizes NL2, and this ubiquitination step is required for astrocyte morphogenesis. This study shows that Neuroligins have non-overlapping roles in controlling astrocyte growth and uncovers a molecular mechanism of how NL2 mediates astrocyte morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

S.; Durvasula, A.; Zhang, X.", "abstract": "Understanding the genetic architecture of complex traits in admixed populations remains challenging due to heterogeneous genetic backgrounds and demographic histories. Mischaracterizing admixture can bias genetic association estimates and limit the generalizability of biomedical findings. Here, we systematically evaluate how evolutionary forces&--including admixture, natural selection, and demographic history--jointly shape complex trait architecture and influence genome-wide association study (GWAS) outcomes using a simulation-based framework complemented by empirical analyses. We model five human admixture scenarios and vary the correlation between causal variant effect sizes and selection coefficients to reflect different trait-fitness relationships. This framework enables simulation of complex trait phenotypes with environmental variance, allowing comprehensive assessment of GWAS power and fine-mapping precision across evolutionary contexts. We find that GWAS power is strongly modulated by both genetic architecture and demographic history. Traits with weak coupling between fitness and effect size, such as anthropometric traits, exhibit higher GWAS power than traits under stronger negative selection, including early-onset diseases. Because rare variants contribute substantially to heritability yet are poorly captured by GWAS, bottlenecked populations with fewer rare variants show enhanced power. Despite large differences in GWAS power, fine-mapping precision remains relatively consistent across traits and populations, improving primarily in regions of high recombination. Empirical analyses of diverse cohorts, the All of Us Research Program, support these patterns. Our findings highlight how evolutionary and demographic forces shape the genetic basis of complex traits in admixed populations and underscore the need for tailored study designs to improve GWAS accuracy and fine-mapping performance in diverse cohorts.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

An increasingly important task with these data has become the transfer of cell type or spatial domain annotations from a given reference (or source) atlas into a new target tissue or sample. The reference and target datasets could be at different resolutions or measured on different experimental platforms. Here, we present a method to perform cross-platform transfer learning that takes as input single-cell or spatial domain labels from a reference atlas or dataset and transfers the labels to a target dataset at a similar or different resolution. Specifically, we use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on the reference data to identify factors associated with labels of interest and project these factors into the target dataset to label each new observation. We use a multinomial model with the factors as covariates and labels as the response to predict labels in the target dataset. In contrast to existing approaches, the advantage of our approach is interpretability, without compromising on accuracy. We demonstrate the performance of the method in two human brain tissues and show that our model identifies spatially coherent domains in the target datasets with concordance of marker gene expression.

One such metabolite is phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), which contains the highest energy phosphate bond above ATP, and has diverse biological functions, including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and glyceroneogenesis. Although PEP is generally considered a cytosolic intermediate, it can also be synthesized within mitochondria by the mitochondria-localized carboxykinase (PCK2, also known as M-PEPCK). However, the mechanism by which mitochondrial PEP is delivered to the cytosolic compartment and caters to cell-specific requirements remains elusive. Here, we identify SLC25A35, a previously uncharacterized mitochondrial inner-membrane protein, as the long-sought carrier responsible for mitochondrial PEP efflux. SLC25A35 is highly expressed in lipogenic cells, such as adipocytes, which employ the mitochondrial pyruvate-to-PEP bypass, and is upregulated by lipogenic stimuli. Reconstitution studies by proteo-liposomes, together with structural analyses, demonstrated specific PEP transport by SLC25A35 in a pH gradient-dependent manner. Importantly, loss of SLC25A35 in adipocytes impaired the conversion of mitochondrial PEP into glycerol-3-phosphate, the glycerol backbone in triglyceride, resulting in reduced glycerolipid synthesis while preserving substrate oxidation in the TCA cycle. Furthermore, blockade of SLC25A35 in the liver of obese mice markedly decreased glycerolipid accumulation, ameliorated hepatic steatosis, and improved systemic glucose homeostasis. Together, the present study identifies mitochondrial PEP transport via SLC25A35 as a metabolic checkpoint of fatty acid esterification, offering a selective target for \"lipogenic mitochondria\" to limit glycerolipid synthesis, a pivotal step in the pathogenesis of hepatic steatosis and Type 2 diabetes.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

We characterized microbiome variation using k-mers. While some environmental variables, such as chlorophyll seasonal range and maximum degree heating weeks, were associated with microbiome composition, we find that host genetics and dominant photosymbionts were more powerful predictors.

K.; Chowdhury, S.; Bissa, B.; Chowdhury, R.; Mukherjee, S.", "abstract": "Background: Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a differentiation process, frequently imparts invasive properties in Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), which leads to a poor prognosis. Cells lose apical-basal polarity, cell-cell connections, and/or chemo-resistance during EMT, which can result in the spread of cancer and the acquisition of additional stem cell-like traits. It is unclear how organelle dynamics influence EMT in this respect. The interaction between cytoskeletal and mitochondrial regulators governing GBM cell EMT is explored in this article. Results and Discussion: In GBM cells, we observed that TGF-{beta}-induced EMT led to a proliferative arrest, which was accompanied by a fragmented mitochondrial morphology, elevated expression of fission markers such as DRP1, MFF, and FIS1, and most importantly, localization of mitochondria near the cell boundaries. An increase in mitochondrial ROS accompanied this, but their functional status was indicated by a higher oxygen consumption rate (OCR). Additionally, cytoskeleton re-distribution and EMT reversal were the outcomes of si-RNA-mediated elimination of the fission-marker DRP-1 or pharmacological inhibition of fission by Mdivi-1. On the other hand, drugs that disrupt the cytoskeleton, shifted the spatial distribution of mitochondria to the perinuclear area, which had an adverse effect on EMT. Notably, it was shown that RhoA, a protein that helps organize the actin cytoskeleton, co-immunoprecipitates with DRP1 and governs both cytoskeletal dynamics and mitochondrial fission in its presence. Conclusion: Our research sheds substantial insight on the current interactions between the cytoskeleton and mitochondrial spatial dynamics that control EMT in GBM cells, which may have significant therapeutic implications.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Nevertheless, the mechanisms involved in decoding calcium signal in plants are still largely unclear. Here, we have addressed the question of calcium signal decoding in a bottom-up modelling approach. We started with the thermodynamics of Ca2+ binding to a Ca2+ binding protein (CBP), e.g. via EF hands. Remarkably, Ca2+ binding properties of the EF hands do not coincide with the Ca2+ sensitivity of the protein containing these EF hands. In analysing the next levels of complexity, we identified six universal fundamental Ca2+-decoding modules, in which Ca2+ either interacts directly with a target protein (TP) or modulates its activity via a CBP. These modules are the basic units that enable the amplitude and frequency of Ca2+ signals to be decoded. Representatives of these modules are omnipresent in plant cells. They straightforwardly explain the puzzling finding that Ca2+-dependent kinases exhibit different Ca2+-sensitivities when tested with different substrates. In-depth analysis of the properties of the modules provides a fundamental theoretical basis for understanding Ca2+ signal decoding and may contribute to finding the Rosetta Stone for Ca2+ signals in plants.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

During variable delays, running and licking became anticipatory, and medial prefrontal local field potentials and single neurons showed ramping and reward-locked activity patterns aligned to expected reward time. Switching to a fixed delay rapidly sharpened behavioral anticipation and temporal coding.

Empowered by brain-wide recordings during a two-choice sensory decision-making task from the International Brain Laboratory, we sought to identify the form of expectation-based modulations and how they influence ongoing computations. To discern where, when, and how prior knowledge about the stimulus -- known to be stored in the brain over the inter-trial period -- influences brain activity over the arc from stimulus processing to choice selection and action generation, we disentangled the encoding of the highly correlated stimulus, choice, and prior variables as sensory processors, choice/integration processors, and movement generators. We examined which brain regions were modulated by prior expectations and at which point in the task, and characterized whether those modulations take the form of biasing initial activations or response gains. We found that the activities of choice/integrators and movement generators were influenced by prior expectation, while purely stimulus processors were not significantly modulated by prior expectation. In addition, we found that expectation-based modulation takes the form of both initial activity bias and gain modulation in integration/choice computations and in movement generators. We further find that the brain-wide recordings reveal an emergent simplicity: A few-parameter mechanistic neural circuit model captures the population dynamics of stimulus response, integration/choice processing, and action initiation, as well as their modulations by the prior. After fitting to physiology, the model's behavior predicts the psychometric and chronometric behavior of mice with no additional parameters. It reveals that the larger bias and gain modulations of movement initiators relative to integration/choice in the data and model is inherited by amplifying integrator/choice inputs rather than being an additional expectation-based effect.

We used CDCs defective in engaging glycans or cholesterol to confirm that CDCs deficient in sterol binding, but not glycan binding, could bound to L. major. Thus, in non-mammalian systems, CDCs may rely on glycans for binding, while using sterols for pore-formation. This suggests that CDCs may not be sterol-specific probes in some non-mammalian systems.

Previous studies have linked the shortened lifespan of LD-deficient cells to impaired mitochondrial functions caused by defective sterol metabolism, but the molecular origin of this dysfunction remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that lack of nLDs inhibits the DNA damage sensing mechanism, causing insensitivity to DNA-damaging agents. Despite sustained DNA breaks, LD-deficient cells are unable to activate the checkpoint kinases or arrest cell cycle progression. Persistent insensitivity to double-strand breaks results in accumulation of mutations and loss of nuclear as well as mitochondrial DNA integrity, leading to accelerated cellular aging. Through systematic genetic dissection of nLD synthesis genes, we identify a crucial role of lanosterol esterification in lipid droplet formation and their role in the regulation of DNA damage sensing and repair responses. Our study identifies a key regulatory protein, Doa1, that functionally links lipid droplet biosynthesis to DNA damage repair kinase signalling.

We reared H. atroviridis from eggs to adults and described the ontogeny of its reproductive organs using histology and immunohistochemistry with muscle and neural markers. H. atroviridis is a protandrous simultaneous hermaphrodite whose sexual maturity correlates with body size rather than age. The male copulatory system comprises a seminal vesicle, granular vesicle, penis with a penile bulb, and a single copulatory stylet, surrounded by regionally specialized musculature and innervation. In contrast, the female system consists of paired, asaccate ovaries with large, follicle-bound oocytes, lacking a discrete gonopore or copulatory organ. Fertilization occurs internally through traumatic insemination, and eggs are likely released through the mouth. Our findings reveal that the male reproductive system of H. atroviridis exhibits unexpected complexity and structural differentiation despite the organism's overall simplicity.

Application of ProteoForge to proteomics data from lung cancer cells under hypoxia revealed extensive proteoform-level regulation hidden by standard protein-level analysis.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

We compared OncoPro (OP) Tumoroid Culture medium with conventional Wnt/R-spondin medium (Wnt). This recently developed OP medium offers a standardized, serum-free alternative to Wnt-based formulations. Methods: We performed a comparison of OP and Wnt media across 36 PDTO lines from various malignancies. PDTOs were assessed for establishment success, morphology, transcriptomic profiles (bulk RNAseq and fidelity to public single cell (sc) RNAseq databases) and pharmacologic response to a 60-drug panel. Results: Adaptation to OP succeeded in 83% (15/18), whereas de novo establishment favored Wnt (44.4% vs 22.2%). Transcriptomic profiling revealed retained tumor-identity but with different epithelial states: Wnt upregulated proliferation/stemness-associated genes (e.g. LGR5) and OP enriched adhesion-associated genes and inflammatory/TGF-b; programs. In scRNA databases OP signatures preferentially mapped to malignant epithelial compartments in pancreatic cancer, whereas Wnt signatures were linked to non-malignant epithelium. In colon cancer OP signature was correlated with the malignant iCMS3 subtype. Drug screening demonstrated consistent medium-dependent shifts: Wnt-grown organoids were globally more sensitive, particularly to MAPK-axis inhibitors and apoptosis-sensitizers, while OP-grown organoids exhibited relative resistance. Conclusions: Culture medium composition is a key determinant of PDTO phenotype, transcriptome and drug sensitivity. Wnt supports proliferation-associated genes and drug-sensitive states; OP induces adhesion-associated genes and inflammatory-related programs, with broader resistance and high fidelity of the transcriptomic signature in public scRNAseq databases of colon- and pancreatic cancer.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

While senescence-targeting drugs are promising adjuvants, their clinical application will require proper patient selection based on post-treatment RIS burden. Current methods to evaluate senescence, however, are tissue based, and given GBM's difficult anatomical location, post-treatment biopsies are impractical. Therefore, novel and less invasive biomarkers for TIS are urgently needed. To this end, we aimed to identify candidate extracellular vesicle (EV) liquid biomarkers for TIS by profiling senescence-associated cargo changes within GBM EVs. Using a panel of GBM patient-derived cell lines, we show that RIS is the primary functional state following radiation exposure and is associated with significant alterations in the cargo of senescent-derived EVs (senEVs). In particular, senEV transcriptomes have an increased abundance of senescence-associated RNA species and enrichment of senescence-associated gene sets. Most striking, however, was that senEVs are most differentiated by the significant enrichment of a panel of snoRNAs. This signature was conserved in 4/5 GBM models of RIS and was validated by qRT-PCR. Further analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that snoRNAs are likely co-packaged with their associating proteins, as senEVs had concurrent increases in these binding partners. Finally, in a preliminary patient cohort comparing plasma EVs obtained prior to surgery to those obtained after completion of their radiation therapy, we identified increased senescence-associated RNA such as CDKN2B and GLB1 and the snoRNA SNORA49 in post-radiation EVs. Altogether, this data suggests that senEV RNA species, and particularly snoRNAs, are a promising analyte for RIS-biomarker development. With further study, this work may open avenues for a companion diagnostic for senotherapeutics.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Z.", "abstract": "Background: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a highly prevalent condition characterized by fat build-up in the liver and ranges from benign steatosis to progression to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease including hepatocellular carcinoma, representing a significant cause of chronic liver disease globally.1,2 Current treatment options are limited, primarily relying on lifestyle modifications, highlighting an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Methods: A Cell Painting-style high-content screening phenotypic assay was employed using the PH5CH8 human hepatocyte cell line to identify small molecules capable of modulating induced hepatic steatosis. The Plex Research artificial intelligence (AI) platform was utilized for target deconvolution of the lead hit compound, -terthienyl. In vivo efficacy was assessed in a diet-induced obesity (DIO) C57BL/6J mouse model of MASLD. Biochemical assays and molecular docking simulations were performed to validate predicted target interactions. Results: Phenotypic screening identified 15 chemical probes/drugs that elicit dose-responsive inhibition of steatosis, and 16 that exacerbate steatosis, which could contribute to worsening of the disease clinically. -terthienyl, a plant-derived natural product, was identified as a potent and non-toxic inhibitor of steatosis in PH5CH8 cells with an EC50 of 106 nM. In vivo, -terthienyl administration to diet-induced obesity (60% fat diet) mice significantly reduced hepatic steatosis histologically, improved glucose tolerance, and favorably modulated serum biomarkers including ALT and AST. AI-driven analysis predicted dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-IV) and 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17{beta}13) as potential molecular targets of -terthienyl. Biochemical inhibition of DPP-IV was observed and an oxidized -terthienyl analog inhibited HSD17{beta}13. Molecular docking supported these predictions, indicating binding to DPP-IV and HSD17{beta}13. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the successful application of phenotypic screening integrated with AI-driven target deconvolution to identify compounds and drugs that ameliorate or exacerbate hepatic steatosis. -terthienyl was identified as a novel modulator of hepatic steatosis with in vivo efficacy in a MASLD model. Our findings suggest a dual-target mechanism involving DPP-IV and HSD17{beta}13, potentially engaged by the parent compound and its metabolite, respectively, offering a promising polypharmacological approach for MASLD treatment.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

We investigated the genetic basis of red/green variegation observed in the aerial organs of the P0429 accession. We demonstrated that this color mosaic is primarily localized to the epidermal bladder cells (EBCs), with red EBCs accumulating ~50-fold higher betacyanin levels than colorless EBCs. Cell-type-specific RNA-sequencing of EBCs identified the cytochrome P450 gene Cqu0091301 (CYP76AD) as the dominant and rate-limiting factor, exhibiting strong upregulation in red EBCs. This high pigmentation requires a specific structural variation in the P0429 accession: a ~4-kb genomic insertion that restores the full functionality of Cqu0091301, which is otherwise truncated and non-functional in common reference genomes. Genomic analysis reveals that Cqu0091301 is part of a CYP76AD-DODA gene cluster. Notably, expression analysis revealed functional divergence between the quinoa subgenomes, with B-subgenome CYP76AD genes highly dominant in EBCs, while A-subgenome homologs were preferentially expressed in other tissues.

Engineering a bifunctional phenylpropanoid pathway in WT plants did not negatively impact growth, while introducing a tyrosine-specific pathway in the c4h mutant could overcome the seedling-lethal phenotype. Interestingly, restored c4h mutants relying solely on the tyrosine route displayed developmental defects linked to the strong overaccumulation of the auxin transport inhibitor cis-cinnamic acid.

Network reconstruction revealed a topology dominated by two central hubs, EGR1 and FOS, which co-regulate partially overlapping target gene sets. In addition, we uncovered a positive feedback loop between EGR1, a canonical RAF-MAPK effector, and TCF7, a transcription factor typically linked to Wnt signaling. Through this interaction, TCF7 emerges as a nexus that integrates MAPK and Wnt pathway inputs.

Background noise can also alter sound-specific auditory responsivity. Yet, the potential enhancing effects of learning on AC processing in noise is unknown. Pharmacological inhibition of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) by RGFP966 has been shown to improve AC coding when administered during various auditory learning paradigms. Here, adult rats (Sprague-Dawley males) were trained in ideal quiet conditions to learn a tone-reward associative task while treated with RGFP966 (TRAINED+RGFP966, n = 6) to determine if learning-related effects on AC could support tone-signal detection in a later background noise challenge. RGFP966 accelerated sound-reward learning relative to a trained but untreated group of rats (TRAINED, n = 5), though all animals ultimately reached equivalent high levels of performance prior to testing. Training produced a sound-specific enhancement in AC responses evoked by the signal tone, and a sound-general effect that suppressed responses during steady-state noise, relative to untrained rats (NAIVE, n = 7). Effects were strongest when training was with RGFP966 administration and scaled with increasing signal-to-noise (SNR). High levels of background noise abolished sound-specific enhancements in tone-signal evoked AC activity, yet the general suppressive effect to noise was maintained. Remarkably, behavioral responses to the signal tone in different SNRs recapitulated AC patterns of tone-evoked responding. Overall, rapid auditory learning facilitated by RGFP966 yields AC plasticity that can improve signal detection. Learning-induced mechanisms appear to shape cortical decoding mechanisms that selectively enhance representations of signal sounds and suppress the effects of background noise.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we analysed a large-scale eQTL dataset from Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which experienced a WGD 100 million years ago. We found that trans-regulatory connections were enriched between duplicated regions, indicating long-term conservation of ancestral interchromosomal regulatory interactions.

Using a hydroponic Arabidopsis thaliana-Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) pathosystem, we integrated biometric, anatomical, hydraulic, and gas-exchange measurements to dissect how viral infection reshapes root-shoot water relations. TuMV impaired root development, as reflected by an early plateau of primary root elongation. At the functional level, infected plants exhibited a decrease in root hydraulic conductance per unit root mass, concomitant with transcriptional downregulation of root aquaporin genes. Despite this, the relative contribution of aquaporin-mediated water transport, assessed via sodium azide inhibition, remained unchanged, indicating that the virus downregulates total hydraulic capacity without altering the apoplastic-symplastic partitioning of water flow. Gas-exchange analysis revealed a virus-induced decoupling between stomatal conductance and net CO2 assimilation, resulting in a non-adaptive increase in intrinsic water-use efficiency. This loss of photosynthetic plasticity, combined with shoot-localized osmotic adjustment (more negative leaf osmotic potential and higher relative water content), points to a constrained, suboptimal physiological state. Multivariate analysis confirmed that variation in physiological traits largely drives phenotypic divergence between treatments. Together, these coordinated alterations, reduced root hydraulics, rigid gas-exchange relationships and passive hydraulic matching to a stunted shoot, depict plants locked into a low-performance equilibrium, poorly equipped to compete for water and carbon.

In this study, we investigate patterns of morphological and ecological variation within Thymus sect. Mastichina, a Mediterranean lineage that includes the endangered species T. albicans. Previous genomic analyses revealed clear differentiation between two major groups corresponding to ploidy levels, as well as additional genetic structure among diploid lineages. Here, we integrate this genomic framework with detailed analyses of floral morphology and ecological niches to assess the correspondence between phenotypic, ecological, and genetic variation. Our results reveal substantial overlap among genetic lineages at both morphological and ecological levels. Although some differentiation is associated with ploidy level, particularly in floral traits, extensive variability within several lineages obscures clear taxonomic boundaries based on discrete morphological characters. By contrast, some diploid lineages (notably the Cadiz and Algarve groups) show lower morphological variability but still both overlap in morphology and ecological niche. We morphologically characterized a recently discovered diploid lineage (Hercynian) that appears to be cryptic with the tetraploid T. mastichina. Patterns of admixture involving this Hercynian lineage, especially with the diploid Donana group, contribute to pronounced phenotypic overlap, whereas no significant effect of tetraploid introgression on diploid morphology was detected. Ecological niche analyses indicate that niche differentiation is primarily associated with ploidy level rather than among diploid lineages, except for the Hercynian group. Overall, our results demonstrate a marked discordance between phenotypic variation and genetic structure, supporting the interpretation of Thymus sect.

We measured the response of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) leaf and fruit transcriptome, as well as a few selected metabolites in the mature fruit, to an infestation of the generalist green peach aphid (Myzus persicae). The aphids were introduced approximately halfway through the lifecycle of the plants that were grown under conventional and organic fertilizer regimes. While plants provided with conventional fertilizer experienced greater aphid infestation, neither group suffered a significant loss in total yield or fruit quality.

This knowledge needs to be translated to crop plants to support the development of varieties that can be grown in different and rapidly changing climatic conditions. However, due to increased genome complexity and limited prior knowledge, translation into crops is not always straightforward. Here, we present a study of the GRN controlling flowering time in Brassica napus (oilseed rape), an allotetraploid crop that is a close relative of Arabidopsis. Using a comparative transcriptomics approach, we show that the majority of the orthologous gene pairs have similar expression dynamics over development between Arabidopsis and Brassica napus. Some genes, however, have experienced regulatory changes, with flowering time genes in Brassica napus having higher than average differences in their expression profiles from their Arabidopsis orthologues. Despite these differences, the inferred GRN for flowering in Brassica napus exhibits a similar network topology to the network known in Arabidopsis. This is likely due to preferential retention of these genes in higher paralogue numbers, which allows subtle changes in the regulation of individual paralogues, while still conserving the overall regulatory structure through evolution. We discover and present a detailed analysis of one such example where orthologues of SUPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) have similar expression patterns under normal conditions, but different dynamics under cold temperature conditions, suggesting possible subfunctionalisation among paralogues in response to temperature change.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Root apical meristem architecture of Atphyl2.1-1 and another mutant Atphyl2.1-2 was disturbed and distances from the root quiescent center to the transition zone and the first areas of mis-organized cells were affected in both mutants. Investigation of the SNARE AtKNOLLE revealed significant perturbation of Atphyl2.1-1 cell plate formation in the mis-organised areas. Our results provide a first characterization of the phytolongin AtPHYL2.1 which appears involved in root cell plate formation, root cell division and therefore root development.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

In plants from microalgae to gymnosperms, members of the ACR3 transporter family mediate arsenic tolerance, yet their evolution, diversity, and regulatory mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Here, ACR3 genes from phylogenetically distant Coccomyxa subellipsoidea (CsACR3), Raphidocelis subcapitata (RsACR3), Chlamydomonas eustigma (CeACR3), Physcomitrium patens (PpACR3), and Picea sitchensis (PsACR3) were cloned, heterologously expressed in budding yeast, and functionally characterized alongside previously reported ACR3 genes from Marchantia polymorpha (MpACR3) and Pteris vittata (PvACR3). Our in silico analysis confirms that the putative proteins share structural and sequence homology with characterized ACR3 transporters, with many family members harboring elongated N-terminal tails unique to plant orthologs. We confirm that the analyzed genes encode functional arsenic efflux transporters conferring distinct levels of arsenite and arsenate resistance in yeast cells. We show that, in yeast cells, CsACR3, RsACR3, and PvACR3 constitutively localize to the plasma membrane, whereas the subcellular localization of CeACR3, MpACR3, PpACR3, and PsACR3 is regulated by metalloid exposure, triggering their endoplasmic reticulum-to-plasma membrane trafficking. Using MpACR3 as a model, we prove that this transporter requires its N-terminal domain for the intracellular retention, which is dynamically alleviated specifically in response to metalloids.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

To project the data onto a standardized brain, we created a unique transformation matrix that links over 800 anatomical terms to voxel coordinates of a parcellated standard brain. This novel method of knowledge projection extracts region-specific information about biomedical concepts from the literature to support translational multi-scale approaches to computational neuroscience.

We found that odor identity and reward associations were encoded by OB-projecting ensembles early during odor exposure, whereas mPFC-projecting neurons encoded this information later, aligned with behavioral responses. Moreover, mPFC-projecting neurons maintained a stable representation of valence across days, while OB-projecting neurons exhibited pronounced plasticity.

Generating gnotobiotic bees harboring all 32 different combinations of the core bacteria, we found that bacterial colonization generally reduces the host lifespan. This indicates that despite commensal gut microbes coevolved with the host, their presence is in principle costly for survival of individual bees. Regression analysis including higher-order interactions reveals that bacterial interactions have significant impacts on the host lifespan and show a qualitative trend: 2- and 4-way interactions exhibit positive, while 3- and 5-way interactions are negative. Numerical simulations based on a general Lotka-Volterra model demonstrate that the observed trend is reproduced when competitive interactions dominate in the bacterial community.

We examined mussels from a one-month reciprocal transplant experiment between a cool, wave-exposed and a warm, wave-protected microhabitat.

We hypothesize that clinical scalability can be improved by tracking and controlling hiPSC clonal heterogeneity, a variable often overlooked in current differentiation approaches. 'Fate priming', wherein clonal lineage identity determines differentiation fate, has been demonstrated in other stem cell differentiation pathways. We investigated fate priming in hiPSC cardiac differentiation using the ClonMapper cell barcoding platform to label, track, and isolate distinct hiPSC lineages from the same cell line. We show that certain hiPSC lineages preferentially differentiate into hiPSC-CMs or non-CMs. After isolating lineages with apparent fate priming, we found significant differences in cardiac differentiation outcomes between these single-clone populations and heterogeneous, multi-clone hiPSC populations.

As the ROI approaches cellular dimensions (~10 microns), laser-induced photothermal damage and challenges in capturing microtissues in conventional LCM can compromise protein preservation and quantitative fidelity. This work introduces multi-tiered microDicers, fabricated by two-photon polymerization, to mechanically dissect tissue slices into uniform microtissues down to 10 microns. The hierarchical blade architecture limits instantaneous blade-tissue engagement and lowers the cutting force relative to single-tier designs. For benchmarking, proteomic analysis is performed on ethanol-fixed human squamous cell carcinoma microtissues generated by microDicers and by LCM. Under identical Nanodroplet Processing in One pot for Trace Samples (nanoPOTS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) conditions, microDicers yield more peptides and proteins than LCM, with the largest gains at 10-20 micron spatial resolution. Confocal imaging shows catapult-associated cavities in LCM-generated microtissues. This material loss, along with membrane-limited protein extraction, likely reduces protein coverage. In contrast, multi-tiered microDicers enables reproducible microdissection down to 10 microns while maintaining high protein coverage. With spatial registration of microtissues under development, microDicers have potential to complement LCM for next-generation spatial proteomic workflows.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

How voluntary rehabilitation engages and reorganizes the supraspinal targets of the intact CST remains incompletely understood. Here, we combined unilateral pyramidotomy (uPyX) in male and female mice with continuous voluntary complex-wheel running to test whether fine motor-dependent rehabilitation drives supraspinal CST plasticity. uPyX mice rapidly resumed wheel running after a transient deficit. In contrast to lesion-only controls, rehabilitation significantly improved skilled forelimb performance on the horizontal ladder rung task. Immunohistochemical c-Fos labeling confirmed that complex-wheel running robustly activated the intact forelimb CST in motor cortex. Whole-brain CST projection mapping using intersectional viral vector tracing revealed targeted supraspinal reorganization localized to medullary motor nuclei. Three nuclei - the lateral paragigantocellular reticular nucleus (LPGi), gigantocellular reticular nucleus, alpha part (GiA), and ventral medullary reticular nucleus (MdV) - exhibited significant lesion- and/or rehabilitation-induced increases in CST innervation. Rehabilitation-driven CST sprouting correlated with regional c-Fos activation, indicating activity-dependent remodeling. Notably, CST projection density in the MdV, critical for skilled forelimb control, predicted functional recovery. These findings identify a set of spinally-projecting medullary nuclei as key substrates for rehabilitation-induced CST plasticity and highlight the MdV as a potential mediator of restored motor function. This work defines how voluntary rehabilitation reorganizes spared corticospinal pathways and provides targets for optimizing activity-based interventions after SCI.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

We found that ventilation acutely increased intracranial pressure and induced a long-lasting suppression of glymphatic transport, thereby re-routing and impairing brain waste clearance and promoting cytokine accumulation. These observations establish a mechanistic link between ventilator-associated alterations in brain fluid dynamics and delirium.

CRF and its receptor (CRFR1), in part, mediate EtOH potentiated GABA release in the medial nucleus of the central amygdala (CeM) of adult male rodents. Interestingly, our lab has shown a disruption in the function and expression of CeM CRFR1 and acute EtOH's effects on GABA transmission in PAE adolescent animals, but it is unknown whether these alterations to the CRF system persist into adulthood or alter the actions of acute EtOH on GABAergic transmission in the CeM. Using CRF1-Cre-tdTomato rats, this study examined how moderate PAE alters acute EtOH modulation of GABAergic neurotransmission onto CRFR1+ and CRFR1- CeM neurons in adult offspring (P80-105). Pregnant dams were exposed to vaporized ethanol or room air (control) on gestational day 12 (G12) for 6 hours and whole-cell electrophysiology was performed in the CeM to assess the actions of acute EtOH (44, 66, & 88 mM) on GABAergic transmission onto CRFR1+ and CRFR1- neurons. We found unique effects of PAE that were cell type- and concentration-dependent in males and females, suggesting PAE dysregulates acute EtOH's modulation of GABA transmission within the CeM in a sex-specific manner.

R.; Hede, F. D.; Barra, C.", "abstract": "Background: T cell-mediated autoimmunity arises when autoreactive T cells recognise self-peptides presented on MHC class II molecules and get activated. Although HLA associations strongly link antigen presentation to autoimmune risk, it remains unclear whether altered antigen processing itself contributes to disease. Methods: We compiled a curated catalogue of experimentally verified human T-cell autoantigens and classified their source proteins based on their natural presentation on HLA-DR in healthy individuals. If the protein has peptides presented it is classified as tolerant, and if there are no peptides presented it is classified as cryptic. Protein features, subcellular localizations, and biological functions were compared between groups. To evaluate disease-specific presentation, we analyzed immunopeptidomics datasets from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis and compared their peptide repertoires, flanking residues, and structural properties with those from healthy donors. Findings: The cryptic and tolerant autoantigen classes revealed distinct molecular and disease-related characteristics, including differences in subcellular localization, biological function, and association with organ-specific or systemic autoimmunity. Cryptic autoantigens are enriched in the membrane, have functions related to the targeted tissue, and are primarily associated with organ-specific diseases. Tolerant autoantigens are found extracellularly, have functions connected with the immune system and are enriched in systemic autoimmunities. In rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, MHC-presented peptides displayed altered terminal amino-acid preferences in the peptide flanking regions, and higher relative surface accessibility compared with their healthy donors MHC-presented peptide counterparts, consistent with modified proteolytic processing. Cryptic proteins were substantially overrepresented among MS-derived ligands, suggesting increased antigen-processing dysregulation in organ-specific autoimmunity. Interpretation: We propose that there exist two different autoimmune activation mechanisms. In the first mechanism cryptic proteins are revealed due to aberrant antigen processing resulting in autoimmune responses. In the second mechanism, peripheral tolerance breaks down, driving autoimmune responses toward normally presented self-proteins.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Large Language Models (LLMs) capable of video understanding offer a transformative solution to manual scoring, crucial for accelerating and standardizing neuroscience workflows. Aim: We sought to benchmark state-of-the-art video LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro, Qwen3-VL, and VideoLLaMA3) for automated behavioural segmentation and scoring of mice performing a water-reaching task. Approach: Videos of mice performing water reaching from the front view were analysed by the LLMs. Accuracy was compared across different models and against prompt adjustments within Gemini. To assess classification determinants, video fidelity was altered through pixel interpolation and key regions blurred (paws/snout-mouth). In addition, the models were asked to describe the mouse's actions over time. Results: Gemini 2.5 Pro (Mean: 0.74, SD: 0.12) and Qwen3-VL-30B (Mean: 0.67, SD: 0.13) exhibited ability to classify trial outcomes. Reliable classification required a minimum pixel resolution of 0.28 mm per pixel. Accuracy is significantly reduced upon obscuring the snout-mouth area.

Importantly, DW-SSFP can achieve this with the additional benefit of negligible geometric distortions, unlike conventional diffusion MRI using an echo-planar imaging readout. Using optimised DW-SSFP sequence parameters, we propose a protocol at 0.4 mm isotropic resolution using a two-shell multi-orientation protocol (effective b-values of 3200 s/mm^2 and 5600 s/mm^2). We fit the data using Tensor, Ball and 3-Sticks and Constrained Spherical Deconvolution signal representations. The results demonstrate high-quality diffusivity estimates across the entire brain with the ability to resolve multiple fibre populations in challenging crossing-fibre regions. The data will be made fully open source and multimodal as part of the Center for Mesoscale Connectomics, providing a resource for future connectivity investigations.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

MICOS disruption has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), yet the spatiotemporal dynamics of MICOS-associated neuronal alterations during aging remain unclear. Using three-dimensional reconstructions of hypothalamic and cortical neurons, we observed age-dependent fragmentation of mitochondrial cristae, reduced intermitochondrial connectivity, and compartment-specific changes in mitochondrial size and morphology. Notably, these structural deficits were most pronounced in neurons vulnerable to AD-related pathology, suggesting a mechanistic link between MICOS disruption and the early mitochondrial dysfunction observed in patients with AD. Our findings indicate that the loss of MICOS integrity is a progressive feature of neuronal aging, contributing to impaired bioenergetics and reduced resilience to metabolic stress and potentially facilitating neurodegenerative processes. MICOS disruption reduced neuronal firing and synaptic responsiveness, with miclxin treatment decreasing mitochondrial connectivity and inducing cristae disorganization. These changes link MICOS structural deficits directly to impaired neuronal excitability, highlighting vulnerability to AD-related neurodegeneration. These results underscore the importance of MICOS as a critical determinant of neuronal mitochondrial health and as a potential target for interventions aimed at mitigating AD-related mitochondrial dysfunction.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Although the causative agent, Vibrio cholerae, has been extensively studied in isolation, investigation of its interactions with the gut microbiota started relatively recently. We and others previously showed that microbiota-derived metabolites significantly influence V. cholerae behavior. By investigating how an organic extract of human feces affects V. cholerae gene expression, we showed that gut metabolites strongly suppress swimming motility, a trait important for host colonization. Interestingly, extracts of pure cultures of a gut commensal, Enterocloster citroniae, recapitulated this inhibition. Here, we present a comprehensive examination of the effect of small molecules produced by E. citroniae and related species on V. cholerae behavior. We show that E. citroniae small molecules inhibit motility by various V. cholerae strains, and that several phylogenetically related species produce this activity, although the magnitude of the effect varies between strains. Using biofilm formation assays in static and flow conditions, we show that V. cholerae strongly induces biofilm formation in response to E. citroniae metabolites. Transcriptome and reporter analyses showed that several genes involved in synthesis of an extracellular polysaccharide are induced by E. citroniae metabolites. Lastly, we show that V. cholerae interactions with host cells are also modulated by this commensal. These findings advance our understanding of microbiome-pathogen interactions and how commensal bacteria influence V. cholerae virulence through the production of small molecules. In the future, this knowledge may be used to design novel microbiome-based therapeutic approaches to combat cholera and other infections.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

We characterised fungal communities of two pine-feeding Ips bark beetles, I. sexdentatus and I. acuminatus, in larval, pupal, and adult stages, and in wild versus laboratory populations, using high-throughput ITS2 amplicon sequencing combined with qPCR and functional assays. Both beetles harboured a stable core mycobiome dominated by Kuraishia, Ogataea, Ophiostoma, Graphilbum and Cyberlindnera, while adults showed species-specific differences and wild beetles, especially I. acuminatus, exhibited greater diversity than laboratory populations. Beetles shared more taxa with unfed control wood than with gallery wood, indicating acquisition during feeding and concurrent restructuring of the wood mycobiome. Monoterpene bioassays on beetle-associated yeasts revealed that mixtures of -pinene, 3-carene and terpinolene suppressed growth more strongly than single compounds, suggesting synergistic inhibition. Yeasts selectively antagonised entomopathogenic fungi and expressed complementary cell-wall-lytic and digestive activities, consistent with combined roles in pathogen suppression and plant-polymer deconstruction.

The mitochondrial contact site and organizing system (MICOS), a central organizer of mitochondrial membrane architecture, was suggested to participate in 'mitoskeleton' formation. Here, we structurally characterize the coiled-coil domain-containing 127 (CCDC127) protein, a putative interactor of MICOS. We show that CCDC127's amino-terminal transmembrane region is anchored in the MOM and the bulk soluble part exposed to the IMS. A crystal structure of CCDC127's central coiled-coil displays a parallel dimer which further oligomerizes into tetramers. We demonstrate that the carboxy-terminal helical bundle (CHB) domain dimerizes to create a peripheral membrane-binding site.

In muscle, IACs located at costameres, also serve to transmit the force of muscle contraction to the outside of the cell. We have reported that IACs, which are found at the bases of dense bodies and M-lines, and at muscle cell boundaries (MCB) in C. elegans muscle, require the RacGEF PIX-1 for their proper assembly or maintenance. We have reported that a RacGAP for the PIX pathway is RRC-1, is in a complex with PIX-1, and that RRC-1 is required for assembly or maintenance of IACs at MCBs. Our previous studies suggested that RRC-1 might be associated with the muscle cell membrane, and here we present evidence that this occurs via its PX domain, a domain that is known to bind to membrane phosphoinositides (PIPs). We predict the existence of a PX domain based on bioinformatic analysis and AlphaFold3, which includes conserved residues characteristic of most PX domains and a PIP binding site. This region of RRC-1 binds to phosphoinositides in vitro. Analysis of a nematode strain that has an in-frame deletion of the PX domain, indicates that normal localization of RRC-1 to the MCB requires both its PX domain and the PIX scaffold protein GIT-1. Lastly, we show that the overexpression of the full length RRC-1, but not RRC-1 with an in-frame deletion of its PX domain, results in reduced accumulation of IAC components and reduced whole animal movement.

Lack of these phosphatases blocks differentiation of stem cells into adipocytes, a defect rescued by the PPAR{gamma} agonist troglitazone.

In a cohort of 46 treatment-naive CRC patients and 33 controls, Asima Rev achieved 96% sensitivity and 94% specificity, with longitudinal monitoring in six patients fully concordant with clinical outcomes. Interrogation of 11 public methylation array datasets showed that whole array analyses underestimate global changes. However, restricting analyses to OpenSea regions, where cfDNA is enriched, revealed patterns consistent with Asima Rev and a significant 5.8% global hypomethylation in CRC tissue compared to adjacent normal tissue. Hypomethylation was not observed in immune cell genomic DNA (gDNA), a major contributor to cfDNA, supporting a predominantly tumor-derived contribution to the observed cfDNA signal.

Modern root systems were significantly smaller with fewer, thinner roots at higher density compared to older hybrids. However, the total amount of roots in the topsoil extrapolated across an acre was indistinguishable, revealing an equilibrium between crown size and density. Surprisingly, there was a 20% increase in the soil volume explored by individual modern hybrids, indicating increased overlap of root systems. We estimated modern hybrids share 43 - 46% of the topsoil with neighbors, compared to 14% in the oldest. Furthermore, when the oldest hybrids were grown at modern densities, their root crowns became more elliptical than modern hybrids, highlighting potential differences in avoidance response.

As cost-effective alternatives, strategic combinations of approved drugs can be used to enhance the efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum. Understanding the metabolic consequences of such combinations is essential for optimizing treatment strategies and delaying drug resistance. Methods: An integrated metabolomic and pharmacological analysis was performed on P. falciparum exposed to chloroquine (CQ), pyrimethamine (PY), sulfadoxine (SD), and their combinations (SDPY and SDCQ). Dose-response assays were used to quantify drug potency, whereas untargeted metabolomic profiling was used to assess pathway-level perturbations associated with individual and combined treatments. Results: Dose-response assays confirmed the nanomolar potency of PY (IC50; = 12.5 nM) and CQ (IC50; = 11 nM) compared with the micromolar efficacy of SD (IC50; = 9.1 microM), which is consistent with its role as a synergistic antifolate partner. Metabolomic profiling revealed that PY strongly disrupted folate-dependent pyrimidine biosynthesis, leading to deoxyuridine and dUMP accumulation, whereas SD caused milder perturbations, which was consistent with DHPS inhibition. CQ produced modest metabolic effects alone but markedly amplified antifolate-induced stress when combined with PY. Drug combinations generated metabolic responses that are distinct from those resulting from individual treatments. Across antifolate combinations, consistent trends included reduced amino acid pools, suppression of thiamine and glutathione metabolism, and enhanced PPP inhibition, leading to broad disruption of nucleotide, redox, and carbon metabolism. Conclusions: Pyrimidine suppression has emerged as the central hallmark of antifolate-based therapy in P. falciparum. The distinct synergistic signatures observed with drug combinations support their potential to enhance efficacy and delay resistance.

Mice overexpressing TAF15 in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons exhibited heightened anxiety and impaired fear memory, mimicking some key features of FTD behavioral abnormalities.

Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) can acutely modulate executive function in healthy adults, but the effects of repeated dosing, roles of executive subdomains, and importance of sex as a biological variable require clarification. Method: In a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled, parallel group study, 12 healthy adults (six women) received 10 consecutive days of left monoaural taVNS (VNS) or sham (CON), with a two-week follow-up rechallenge. Stimulation (100Hz; 200us pulse width) was delivered continuously (online) at rest and during the Eriksen Flanker (inhibition), Wisconsin Card Sorting (shifting), and Sternberg (working memory) tasks. Resting autonomic measures included pupil diameter, skin conductance (SCL), mean R-R interval (mRR), respiration, and blood pressure. Primary outcomes were analyzed with linear mixed models and Sidak-corrected contrasts. Results: Ten days of taVNS produced immediate and cumulative changes in multiple executive function subdomains that remained evident at rechallenge, with the strongest effects on accuracy. Across tasks, benefits were most pronounced in women; men displayed initial performance costs, but with greater longitudinal improvements. Cognitive effects were most evident on higher-difficulty trials. Autonomically, taVNS increased SCL during and after stimulation, amplified stimulus- and task-evoked pupil responses, and transiently lengthened mRR. Stimulation was well tolerated and blinding was acceptable. Conclusions: Resolution of taVNS effects to higher-difficulty trials supports adaptive-gain modulation within executive function networks. The combination of larger evoked pupil/SCR, transient mRR lengthening, and increased SCL indicates that taVNS increased autonomic flexibility and arousal. Our findings identify biological sex and stimulation intensity as potentially important considerations for taVNS efficacy and provide longitudinal estimates to guide dosing, biomarker selection, and trial design. Collectively, the results support continued development of taVNS as a safe tool for the modulation of executive function and autonomic activity in healthy adults.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

How these network architectures are implemented across sensorimotor pathways to control behavior is unclear. We investigate this tradeoff directly in Drosophila by comparing neuronal circuits underlying landing and takeoff, behaviors transforming similar visual cues to whole-body motor output. Using a whole-CNS connectome, electrophysiology, and behavioral analysis, we reconstruct the complete feedforward pathway for landing, including visual feature detectors, a dedicated ensemble of descending neurons (DNs), and a core premotor circuit in the nerve cord. Comparison to the takeoff pathway reveals that, despite encoding the same sensory feature and engaging similar muscle groups, neuronal circuits controlling the two behaviors are separated at every sensorimotor level. Extending this analysis to the complete DN population reveals a blueprint for descending motor control: DNs across the behavioral space utilized by the fly are organized as a set of parallel, loosely-overlapping ensembles that form a continuum from command-like control, with individual DNs determining behavioral output, to population coding, with multiple DNs controlling behavior synergistically. Distinct combinations of sensory feature detectors differentially recruit DN ensembles to enable flexible, context-dependent behavioral control.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

This shift from the historically sporadic pattern of SLEV activity prior to 2003 raises the question of whether contemporary SLEV strains differ in fitness in Culex vectors compared with earlier strains. To determine whether reemerging SLEV possess augmented infectivity and transmissibility that may have facilitated reestablishment, we compared the vector competence of five genotype III SLEV strains detected in California between 2016 and 2023 with a historic genotype V strain from 2003. Laboratory colonies of the two primary California vectors, Culex (Cx.) tarsalis and Cx. quinquefasciatus, were orally exposed to bloodmeals containing 3, 5, or 6.7 log10 plaque forming units (PFU)/mL of SLEV, and infection, dissemination, and transmission were assessed 13-14 days later by quantifying SLEV RNA in individual mosquitoes. Both species exhibited strong dose-dependent responses, with minimal infection at 3 log10 PFU/mL and uniformly high infection, dissemination, and saliva positivity at 6.7 log10 PFU/mL. At 5 log10 PFU/mL, genotype III strains infected Cx. quinquefasciatus more efficiently than the historical 2003 strain, which failed to infect this species. In Cx. tarsalis, fitness differences among SLEV strains were more modest and strain-specific. These findings demonstrate that multiple genotype III SLEV strains exhibit equal or greater vector infectivity in Cx. quinquefasciatus than the 2003 genotype V strain, suggesting that enhanced fitness in this vector may contribute to the persistence and geographic spread of SLEV in California since its reemergence and underscoring the need for continued vector surveillance and targeted control efforts to reduce SLEV transmission to humans.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Resident proteins that define each organelle modify transiting cargo proteins, with both retention and trafficking between organelles governed by pH-dependent mechanisms. For example, lysosomal enzymes bind mannose-6-phosphate receptors at the higher pH (~6.5) of the Golgi and dissociate at the lower pH (~5.5) of late endosomes(1). Proteins that stray from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are captured by KDEL receptors in the acidic Golgi and returned into the neutral ER(2,3). This pH-tuned trafficking system compartmentalizes organelle function and prevents mis-localization of critical enzymes(4). Dysregulated organelle pH disrupts their function and leads to various diseases. Because protons move rapidly in water, the pH within a single organelle is currently assumed to be spatially uniform(5). Here, using a reporter sensitive from pH 5.5 - 10.5 to map a spectrum of organelles at high resolution, we discovered that pH gradients exist within single, large or long organelles such as the ER and mitochondria, and in membrane-less organelles without ion-transporting proteins such as the nucleolus. These new findings upend our understanding of organellar pH, prompting new questions about proton diffusion within the cell, and its potential consequences on organelle function.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

However, there is currently no quantitative assessment of the extent and support received by the drivers of the phenology of births in mammals. Due to their diverse phenology of births, large herbivores represent an ideal case study to quantify this. Aims: our objective was to identify the different drivers tested for their effect on the phenology of births in large herbivores and how much empirical support they received, as well as determine thematic, taxonomic and spatial gaps in the literature. Methods: We conducted a systematic review focusing on the drivers of the phenology of births in wild large herbivores. We extracted the outcomes of 124 relevant articles and assessed the reliability of their findings using a general index based on the quality of the data and methods used. Results and Discussion: As expected, the two dominant hypotheses (seasonality and predation) received strong support regarding their effect on birth timing and synchrony, respectively. The effect of female, offspring and population characteristics remained marginally accounted for, even though there was evidence of their importance in the determination of the phenology of births. We identified a major research gap in Asian and South and Central American species. Conclusions: We encourage research in these understudied domains, as well as large scale multi-species comparative analyses to fill in the gaps and improve our understanding of reproductive phenology.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

We propose a novel framework for integrating the factors underlying drought-induced tree mortality in a dynamic vegetation model. We evaluate whether this framework accurately reproduces drought-related mortality in six mesic beech-dominated stands in 2018-2020, and over multiple years in a xeric Scots pine-dominated stand in Switzerland. Additionally, we investigate its behavior along a large climatic gradient in central Europe. We employ a three-step approach. First, we evaluate multiple drought indices for capturing tree growth responses to extreme drought. We find that in contrast to widespread indices such as SPI and SPEI, the ForClim drought index captures growth responses to drought intensity during summer, the growing period, and annually. Second, we assess in detail the capability of the ForClim soil moisture model to simulate soil water dynamics, comparing it to the mechanistic soil-vegetation-atmosphere model LWFBrook90. The ForClim soil moisture model adequately simulates soil water dynamics, particularly in extreme drought years. Third, based on Manion Decline Disease Theory, we develop a novel mortality sub-model that combines predisposing and inciting factors. Its integration in ForClim captures drought-induced mortality events in the mesic beech forests as well as the multi-year mortality at the xeric Scots pine-dominated stand. Along a climatic gradient in central Europe, the model provides good quantifications of Potential Natural Vegetation. The novel framework to capture drought-related tree mortality is simple yet produces accurate results. The underlying hypothesis regarding the factors leading to drought-induced tree mortality is promising but requires further tests for its generality.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

We used a hierarchical Bayesian ordinal probit regression model to estimate statistical effects of juvenile body length, seasonal migration timing or river temperature, transported or in-river hydrosystem passage, river flow, and a large-scale ocean index. Results indicated notable carryover effects consistent with underlying biological mechanisms related to growth and development, in which shorter juvenile length and later seasonal migration timing were associated with older adults.

Emerging evidence suggests that distinctness may be as important as chronotype in regulating the temporal organization of key physiological processes. Previous studies have relied on questionnaires and lacked an objective measure of distinctness. Here, we propose the first objective behavioral measure of distinctness based on circular statistics. We applied this approach to 3.4 million login events from 13,894 unique university students and found a non-linear association between distinctness and academic performance: students with moderate daily rhythmicity achieved the highest performance. This relationship varied by chronotype: larks benefited from stronger rhythms, finches from moderate rhythms, and owls from weaker, more flexible rhythms. Circadian distinctness was also closely linked to social jetlag, which increased with more rigid rhythmicity across chronotypes. These findings suggest that the academic disadvantage often attributed to specific chronotypes does not stem from time preference itself, but from the overall interplay of chronotype, distinctness, and schedules that are incompatible with individual biological timings. Considering rhythm flexibility alongside chronotype may therefore improve educational design and equity.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

This is especially important for juvenile stages which are confined to the body of water where they hatched and are unable to relocate for thermoregulation. In an urban desert like Maricopa County, Arizona, the macroclimate is strongly influenced by the urban heat island effect where larval thermal maxima are frequently exceeded. Understanding the local temperatures (microclimates) of sites that mosquitoes chose for egg-laying and larval development is important for managing mosquito populations and reducing disease risk. We deployed small temperature loggers at multiple breeding sites throughout the city and compared those temperatures to gridded reanalysis macroclimate data. We found that the recorded aquatic microclimates were consistently cooler than corresponding macroclimates, and that higher canopy cover further buffered hot temperatures. This suggests that using interpolated macroclimate data to estimate mosquito population dynamics overestimates the thermal stress local mosquitoes actually experience. By using microclimate measures we can better predict mosquito survival and development, allowing us to better understand disease risk both now and with future warming.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

In contrast, laboratory-based coevolution experiments usually last less than a month, often terminating when one species fails to adapt to the other, becoming dormant or extinct. Consequently, there is a poor understanding of the long-term efficacy of bacteriophage therapies (an emerging approach to tackling the Antimicrobial Resistance crisis), and how phage evolve more broadly. We propose a novel approach to coevolution experiments that would address this challenge: instead of open-loop resource-constrained cultures, we develop a closed-loop control approach to stabilise the typically unstable or oscillatory phage-bacteria population dynamics. Achieving this requires the control system to compensate for delays in phage incubation and respond to an evolving system, while only measuring bacterial density. To address it, we develop a model of phage-bacteria dynamics, prototype delay-compensating predictive control strategies, and demonstrate a measurement-aware state observer. Overall, this approach shows the ability to stabilise co-evolution, avoiding the common outcome of unstable or winner-takes-all outcomes. This promises to enable long-term lab coevolution of phage and bacteria, which would would give valuable insights into the mechanisms and timescales of bacteria overcoming phage therapies, and open the possibility of using evolutionary engineering to develop phage for novel biotechnological applications such as the fight against Antimicrobial Resistance.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

A.; Narayanan, M.", "abstract": "Key genes of a complex biological system are often identified by inferring a coexpression network from transcriptomic data and analyzing it using network science measures such as centrality. However, relatively modest sample sizes of transcriptomic data, along with heterogeneity in the human population, can lead to uncertainty about the \"true\" coexpression network. Earlier studies have quantified this uncertainty using bootstrap resampling or similar analysis, but fewer have investigated the extent to which this uncertainty affects downstream network analyses like centrality. This work presents a systematic workflow that estimates and propagates uncertainty about the coexpression network to downstream measures such as degree/PageRank centrality, with the goal of producing a robust (uncertainty-aware) gene ranking and comparing its performance to traditional centrality based rankings. Specifically, we propose bootstrap-based node scores (BOONS) of the form -c{sigma} (for different values of c) that combines the expectation () and variance ({sigma}2) of a centrality measure computed across bootstrapped coexpression networks to prioritize stable central genes. We assess their efficacy with respect to reproducibility, replicability, and tissue specificity on simulated and real-world (GTEx) transcriptomic datasets, and provide sample size recommendations as well. In several of these benchmarks, our BOONS show significantly better performance than the baseline measure that does not incorporate uncertainty. For instance, across five tested GTEx tissues each subsampled to a modest 237 sample size, our proposed (-{sigma})-based ranking shows an average improvement of 48.5% over the baseline for recovering a set of 100 reference genes. Based on results from these benchmarks, especially one pertaining to the recovery of tissue-specific reference genes, we recommend the usage of (-{sigma}) scoring. All our results taken together quantify the negative impact of uncertainty on vanilla centrality based gene rankings, and underscore how adoption of uncertainty-aware analysis such as BOONS proposed in this work is long overdue to obtain stable biological network measures.

How do plants achieve this extreme defensive chemistry, and how do aphids survive it? We integrated transcriptomics, heterologous gene validation in Arabidopsis, and enzyme assays to investigate both plant HT biosynthesis and aphid detoxification mechanisms throughout gall development. Three key genes: Phosphoglucomutase (PGM), UDP-glucosyltransferase BX9 (BX9), and gallate 1-beta-D-glucosyltransferase (GDG) govern HT biosynthesis, with expression patterns closely tracking tannin accumulation dynamics, and GDG as the rate-limiting enzyme. Arabidopsis transformants showed threefold HT increases. Critically, S. chinensis employs specialized laccases rather than tannase for detoxification, with laccase activity exceeding tannase by 20,000-fold. The aphid genome encodes three laccase genes, with Sc-Lac1 expressed in digestive tissues, achieving 39 to 54% HT degradation.

Recent machine learning and deep learning frameworks for predicting siRNA efficacy have only achieved moderate success as these models solely rely either on handcrafted features or on sequential relations and therefore cannot capture the full complexity of siRNA-mRNA interactions. In this context, we propose SiaRNA, which uses a Siamese Neural Network for feature-derived representations and a bidirectional cross-attention mechanism for sequence-level relationships. It uniquely identifies mRNAs and their corresponding siRNAs as paired entities, allowing unified and context-aware modeling.

Leveraging high-quality protein structures, we revisit why allergenic proteins trigger allergies, whereas some of their structural analogues do not. We categorize allergenic protein folds into similar (SAP) and dissimilar (DAP) folds on the basis of their similarity to human proteins, establishing a dual schema that reveals distinct molecular and evolutionary patterns. Here, we show that compared with structurally similar, nonallergenic protein (SNAP) folds, SAP folds are ubiquitous across kingdoms and rich in B- and T-cell epitopes. DAP folds map to a unique sequence-structure-function space and are evolutionarily underrepresented and taxonomically restricted. The persistent divergence of DAP folds from animal proteins suggests their intermittent immune encounters.

We provide statistical and experimental evidence of both neutral genetic drift and natural selection in the diversification of GameXPeptides. GameXPeptides variants rapidly evolved highly insect specific toxicities, suggesting that their diversification may be driven by an evolutionary arms race.

To characterize the structural features and dynamics that contribute to RNA binding, we performed a series of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and show that the complex is highly flexible, undergoing large conformational transitions and deviating significantly from the initial experimental structure. We found that RNA binding significantly restricts but does not abolish the inter-domain movement of the two motifs, whereas the cooperative action of both RRM domains restricts RNA dynamics. Despite the extensive comformational plasticity of the complex, the core of the RNA binding interface and the sequence specificity is maintained. In the absence of one RRM, the RNA binding interface of the first RRM is extended whereas that of the second RRM is diminished leading to destabilization of the RRM-RNA interaction and even unbinding. This is in agreement with previous findings suggesting that the second RRM does not bind RNA on its own.

We assessed the extent of axonal regeneration after sciatic nerve crush and the preferential regeneration following femoral nerve transection using Calb1-Cre/tdTomato reporter mice.

A{beta}-LTMRs upregulated canonical regeneration-associated genes, including Atf3, Sprr1a, Gal, and Gap43. Comparison with published RNA-seq datasets from other sensory neuron populations revealed only modest overlap, indicating that the core injury response shared between neurons is accompanied by a neuron subtype-specific programme.

Comparative study of the intra- and inter-specific variations in mite performances uncovered differences in their behavioral and xenobiotic responsiveness to green tea catechins. We showed that green tea catechins exert complex defensive roles. They were repellent and toxic to T. urticae and tea non-adapted T. kanzawai mites. In addition, they had an antifeedant effect on tea non-adapted T. kanzawai mites. Matching the catechin structure, we identified an intradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenase TkDOG15, a gene horizontally transferred from fungi, as one required for the adaptation of T. kanzawai mites to tea plants. The TkDOG15 gene has an enhanced inducible expression in tea-adapted T. kanzawai mites. Furthermore, we identified two amino acid substitutions in DOG15 between Tetranychus species leading to the increased efficacy of the T. kanzawai encoded enzyme toward cleavage of green tea catechins.

Context-specific dependencies of tumor cell survival on HDACs and the mechanisms through which HDACs determine cell stress responses by specific oncogenic pathways remain to be understood. Here we unravel how the class I deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 control the fate of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells undergoing DNA replication stress. Compared to normal myeloid cells (n=690), CML cells overexpress HDAC1 and HDAC2 (n=234-274). We reveal that HDAC1 and HDAC2 protect cultured and primary CML cells with the hyperactive BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase from programmed cell death through apoptosis upon DNA replication stress. Using transcriptomics and genetically defined knockdown and knockout model systems, we demonstrate that these effects depend on the transcription factor p73 and its pro-apoptotic target gene NOXA. Upon DNA replication stress, p73 binds to the NOXA promoter but only upon additional inactivation of HDAC1/HDAC2 the NOXA gene becomes transcribed. BCR-ABL translocate to the nucleus to catalyze p73 phosphorylation at tyrosine-99 for the induction of p73 and mitochondrial NOXA. Thus, the BCR-ABL oncogene creates a selective vulnerability to HDAC1/HDAC2 inhibitors, driving a cytotoxic shift in replication stress responses towards apoptosis. These data highlight HDAC1/HDAC2 as potential therapeutic targets in CML.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is one of key brain areas executing this function. However, it is unknown how mPFC neurons encode multiple social identities. By developing a new social-identity discrimination task, where a mouse encounters four conspecifics along with in vivo recordings of mPFC neuron spiking activity, we, here, report that the memory of individual social identities can maintain up to two weeks and are robustly encoded by tuned geometric subspaces in mPFC population activity. On contrary, only few neurons exhibit exclusively social-selective responses. Using a cross-session alignment approach of the linear regression and joint-dimensionality reduction, we identify specific low-dimensional neural-subspaces differentially representing individuals over days. Importantly, shifts in social valence, caused by conditioning rewarding, aversive or neutral stimuli associated with different interacted individuals, significantly increase distance and angle between each neural-subspaces. The latter changes in neural representations result from progressive recruitments of neurons that encode associated information of individual valence and identity. Thus, our findings elucidate that tuned neural subspaces in the mPFC underlie a stable encoding of multiple social identities over days, providing a computational framework for understanding complex social memory.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

To probe transcription factor binding and function in a multicellular organism we characterized the binding and transcriptional landscape of NHR-25, a highly-conserved and essential transcription factor in C. elegans. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we tagged the essential nuclear hormone receptor, nhr-25, with GFP and FLAG at its endogenous locus in C. elegans and performed ChIP-seq. We found that NHR-25 binds with two distinct modes: proximal promoter binding and distal enhancer-type binding. Motif analysis of the ChIP-seq peaks showed that the NHR-25 binding motif depended on chromatin context and identified additional enriched motifs, suggesting other putative regulatory partners at composite response elements. By combining ChIP-seq with conditional RNAi knockdown, we characterized nhr-25's transcriptome and identified putative direct targets of NHR-25 binding. Through an 11-bp mutation of the summit of an identified NHR-25 occupied region, we demonstrated that a single response element was responsible for regulating the expression of multiple genes.

Measurable characteristics are particularly critical to the study of ecology. These quantifiable traits can be compared between numerous taxonomic clades to examine how evolutionary forces have shaped biological systems. Although numerous in-depth studies have focused on assessing the life histories of mammalian and avian taxa, few scientific endeavors have addressed the diversity of measurable reproductive characteristics in other vertebrate clades. Here we present the first work examine the macroecology of life history traits in serpentine reptiles and amphibians. Both chosen clades comprise taxa that are limbless, predatory, and primarily restricted to tropical and subtropical latitudes. To test the hypothesis that phylogeny limits the extent to which life-history may overlap, the body mass, lifespan, hatchling size, and clutch size of serpentine amphibians and reptiles will be compared using statistical inference methods (t-tests). The distributions of body mass, lifespan, hatchling size, and clutch size differ among serpentine reptiles and amphibians. Linear models suggest that how hatchling and clutch size vary with body mass also differ between the two. Only the linear model examining how lifespan varies with body mass indicates that broad similarities in life histories exist between serpentine amphibians and reptiles. Our results, that little overlap exists in life-history, suggest that the same macroevolutionary processes that allow serpentine amphibian and reptile ecological niche regimes to converge are not acting on their quantifiable life-history traits.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

It is not confined to brain but is also extended to peripheral tissues and cells, enabling minimally invasive screens aimed at identifying transcriptional surrogates of the health status in HD mutation carriers. Nonetheless, transcriptomics approaches have failed to identify consistent candidates from peripheral blood, probably due to the low impact of the HD mutation in the transcriptional profiles of circulating cells that can be masked by the high cellular complexity of this biofluid. In this study, we applied for the first time single-cell RNA-seq in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to determine those cells that accumulate the most prominent gene expression changes as potential sources of reliable biomarkers. We observed both specific and common transcriptional alterations across different blood cell subtypes, justifying partial overlapping of our results with published bulk transcriptomics datasets. To relate these gene expression patterns with disease progression in the absence of a large cohort of patients, we examined selected candidates in a phenotypically characterized cohort of transgenic R6/1 mice. Of the tested genes, only the changes in the interferon related gene Irf7 in blood were correlated with motor coordination performance in mutant mice. Notably, this gene was significantly upregulated in the striatum of these animals. Overall, transcriptional-based changes in peripheral blood can be linked to HD although dissection of individual blood cells in combination with subsequent validation in mouse models emphasizes the challenges in obtaining clinically relevant biomarkers in HD.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

However, classification algorithms inevitably generate errors, and error rates vary with context. While methods for quantifying error rates in ecoacoustics are well established, there is limited research on what level of model performance is sufficient to reliably determine avian vocalisation patterns. Using an extensive fully expert-labelled acoustic dataset from Peru (18 hours, 6 sites), we examined changes in the probability of detecting target bird vocalisations in the first hour after dawn to address three key questions: (1) How sensitive are models predicting detection probability over time to reductions in classification accuracy? (2) To what extent does aggregating detections over longer time periods impact classification accuracy? Additionally, we used the labelled dataset to assess how the creation and composition of a test dataset for assessing classifier performance can impact the reliability of accuracy metrics: (3) Are estimates of classification precision robust when test and deployment datasets are not independent and identically distributed? Our results indicate that poor classification performance - especially low precision - can lead to misleading inferences about temporal patterns of vocalisations. Aggregating classifier predictions over longer time periods improved recall but often resulted in misleading patterns of vocal behaviour by reducing precision and temporal resolution. We also demonstrate that precision can be substantially overestimated when species presences are rarer in the deployment dataset than in test data. These findings highlight the importance of cautious application of automated classification in acoustic ecology and the need for accuracy assessment methods tailored to the intended ecological analysis.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

To address this, we analyzed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissues from rhesus macaques acutely infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). We focused on two key aging-related proteins: the cellular senescence marker p16INK4a (p16) and the NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). We hypothesized that accelerated aging phenotypes would be detectable during acute infection, manifesting as increased p16 expression and altered SIRT1 levels, correlating with neurodegeneration. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed marked upregulation of GFAP and p16, along with evidence of neurodegeneration, across multiple brain regions - including the frontal lobe, caudate, putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum - by 21 days post-infection. These findings suggest that aging-related and senescence pathways are activated almost immediately following HIV infection, highlighting the potential importance of astrocyte- or CNS-specific therapeutic strategies to mitigate early neuropathology.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Spiders represent one of the largest groups of terrestrial arthropod predators, and an increasing number of species have been introduced globally, posing growing challenges to local biodiversity and ecosystem stability.

Here, we conducted a global-scale survey of 53,172 taxon records and updated the checklist of North American spiders to 5,401 species, including 118 non-native species. By integrating historical records with species occurrence data, we reconstructed the geographic origins of non-native species and found that most originated from Asia and Europe, consistent with long-standing transcontinental trade and intensive human activities. Mapping the contemporary distributions of all non-native species revealed at least six richness hotspots, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas, underscoring strong associations between non-native spider accumulation and population density, trade intensity, and human-mediated dispersal pathways. By analyzing genomes of 45 native and five non-native spider species within North America, we detected a set of metabolic, stress tolerance and immune defense genes under positive selection and rapid evolution in non-native species, suggesting that putative functional innovations may contribute to their establishment, expansion, and ongoing local adaptation.

Code-multiplexing allows parallelization of IFC with simple hardware but requires advanced signal processing algorithm to resolve overlaps in signals originating from different channels. Existing methods, however, rely on multiple task-specific networks with template-based linear fitting, which loses accuracy under nonlinear or unstable conditions common in microfluidic experiments. Prior studies have also been restricted to demultiplexing single-frequency impedance measurements. To this end, we develop a unified deep-unfolding network for analyzing code multiplexed, multi frequency IFC data. We unfold successive-interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm into a deep-learning network that encodes the structural priors of SIC, and enable a single multitask network to resolve overlaps while sharing information across tasks. To mitigate nonlinear signal stretching and amplification, our network recognizes events by predicting bit level intensity and duration. For multi-frequency impedance profiling, we apply least-squares fitting to the predicted single-frequency real-impedance trace to map the real and imaginary impedance traces at other frequencies. On the cell-bead mixture evaluation dataset, our pipeline resolves overlaps from singlets to triplets reliably, reconstructs impedance-intensity distributions accurately, and enables multi-frequency impedance profiling. As a demonstration of principle, we use our pipeline to perform label free quantification of basophil activation from code-multiplexed, multi-frequency IFC measurements.

Multivariate trait analysis resolves a two-dimensional isohydry space: a water-flux stringency axis (gs-E) largely orthogonal to a carbon-economics axis (A-WUEi). Provenances differed strikingly, where two (KKH, DN) showed a rare E{downarrow}A{uparrow} response, achieving high WUEi and maintaining growth under drought.

Results: We assembled a curated dataset of 3,160 drug-pair-strain interactions covering 97 compounds and 10 bacterial strains. We then developed HALO (Held-out Antibiotic interaction Learning from latent bioactivity Observations), a synergy-prediction framework in which each drug pair is encoded using multi-level Chemical Checker (CC) similarity features spanning chemical, target, network, cellular, and clinical bioactivity domains. Under strictly nested, pair-held-out cross-validation (CV1), HALO achieved stable generalization to unseen combinations (accuracy of 0.75; ROC-AUC = 0.82). Performance depended strongly on evaluation stringency: models performed well under random splits but degraded when required to generalize to unseen drug pairs and strain contexts. Despite these constraints, HALO generalized to an independent set of Loewe measurements, achieving ROC-AUC = 0.85 for distinguishing synergy from antagonism.

EMSA and biolayer interferometry demonstrated that EWSR1 binds strongly to two RNA elements: a 48-nucleotide region in the plus-strand 3'-NCR (3NCR48) and a 50-nucleotide region at the 3'-end of the minus-strand replication intermediate (5NCR-RC50), which is complementary to the genome's 5'-NCR and its adjacent sequence. RNA immunoprecipitation from CHIKV-infected cells confirmed that EWSR1 binds CHIKV RNA in vivo. Functional analyses revealed that CHIKV infection downregulates EWSR1 expression and causes its cytoplasmic accumulation. Knockdown or knockout of EWSR1 expression increased CHIKV genomic RNA levels and viral titers, whereas its overexpression suppressed both. EWSR1 reduced the synthesis of both plus- and minus-sense CHIKV RNAs in infected cells. Additionally, EWSR1 was found to bind CHIKV nsP2 and inhibit its helicase activity, which is critical for viral genome replication.

However, physical exercise and dancing can be effective in preventing/reversing this decline. Aim of this study was to verify whether Dance Movement Therapy (DMT), which uses dance, movement, body awareness and embodied interpersonal communication to promote well-being, improves vagally-mediated HRV, which has been linked to physical and mental health, in a sample of people aged over 65. To this purpose, HRV-derived vagal and sympathetic indices, obtained by electrocardiogram signals, as well as tonic skin conductance level, which is a marker of tonic sympathetic activity, recorded during two rest sessions that preceded and followed a 8-week DMT activity, were compared through repeated measures analysis of variance. Results showed post-DMT changes in HRV-derived vagal parameters in the time, frequency and nonlinear domains. More specifically, the root mean square of the successive differences between RR intervals (RMSSD), the high frequency power (HF) and the standard deviation of the beat-to-beat changes in RR intervals (short-term HRV) (SD1) were higher in the post- than pre-DMT session. Conversely, no changes were found in HRV sympathetic indices nor in skin conductance level. The post-DMT improvement in vagally-mediated HRV in healthy old people is a new finding and we argue that this beneficial effect may be due to DMT's ability to enhance social interaction and promote well-being.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

O.; Tripet, F.", "abstract": "Background: Despite Anopheles funestus s.s. being a highly competent and widespread malaria vector in Africa, its population structure remains largely understudied in many countries, including Tanzania. Herein, we examine the genetic diversity, geographic isolation, and gene flow of An. funestus populations across 10 administrative regions in mainland Tanzania. Methods: We employed 12 previously used microsatellite DNA markers to describe genetic diversity, isolation by distance, and gene flow patterns among 10 An. funestus s.s. populations (n = 654) and one An. parensis population (n = 28), used as an outgroup, sampled across 10 regions in mainland Tanzania. Results: Overall, allelic richness (Na) and genetic diversity (HS) did not differ significantly among populations. Although some loci and populations showed significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the patterns were not indicative of sub-structuring within locations. Pairwise genetic divergence (FST) values indicated clear separation between An. parensis and An. funestus s.s., with values exceeding 0.2, consistent with species-level differentiation. Among An. funestus s.s. populations, the highest divergence was observed between southeastern coastal populations (Mtwara, Ruvuma, Lindi) and inland populations, with FST values up to 0.288. There was no evidence of isolation by distance. Instead, patterns of genetic divergence suggested connectivity across the Rift Valley and heterogeneity among southeastern populations. Neighbour-joining analysis and Bayesian genotype clustering identified three distinct population groups: (i) An. parensis (Dodoma), (ii) a genetically distinct An. funestus s.s. population from Mtwara, and (iii) a more homogeneous cluster comprising the remaining An. funestus s.s. populations. Notably, the Mtwara population appeared highly differentiated, with divergence approaching that between An. funestus s.s. and An. parensis, supporting its distinctiveness but not undermining the role of An. parensis as an outgroup. Conclusion: Except for the Mtwara population, whose status will need to be clarified through whole genome sequencing, moderate genetic divergence was found among An. funestus s.s. populations across Tanzania, despite geographical separation and the Rift Valley. The observed genetic structure suggests that anthropogenic gene flow may play a key role in shaping population divergence. Future studies should aim to delineate the effects of local adaptation from recent gene flow to further explore these dynamics.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

A recent meticulous analysis of known quadruplex structures formed from synthetic oligonucleotides shows that quadruplexes can take 33 distinct structural motifs (pair of stacked quartets) that act as scaffolds for simple (multi-layered quartets) and complex (multi-motifs) quadruplex folds. These motifs differ from one another in terms of interstrand connectivity and orientation. The connectivity is primarily governed by diagonal loops that connect alternate strands, and lateral and propeller loops that connect adjacent strands. These loops are absent in the tetramer, wherein interstrand orientation alone dictates the motif type. Nevertheless, a key question that remains unresolved is the complete structural landscape of quadruplex motifs, limiting our understanding of the fold-dependency in various biological functions and diseases. To address this, a total of 156 unique theoretically possible quadruplex motifs are mathematically devised here. A tool named 3D-NuS-Qplex (https://project.iith.ac.in/3d-nus-qplex/) has also been developed to model all the theoretically possible energy-minimized quadruplex folds with the options to incorporate overhangs and non-G-quartets (in addition to G-quartets) in both DNA and RNA contexts. The diversity of quadruplex motifs reported here provides new insight into their structural complexity, which appears greater than previously anticipated.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

The yield and quality of plasmid preparations directly affect downstream applications, including arrayed viral library production and CRISPR library screening. Insufficient plasmid yield or DNA concentration often requires repeated preparations or additional DNA concentration steps to obtain adequate quantities. Similarly, higher variations in yield or quality across wells or plates can render an entire library unsuitable for subsequent experiments. To increase productivity and mitigate human intervention and errors, the present study established an automated workflow for high-throughput plasmid DNA preparation and quantification. The workflow was carried out by the Biomek i7 Hybrid automated workstation, synergizing a robotic liquid handler and multiple peripheral instruments to produce and measure plasmid DNA in a 96-well plate format. Bacterial competent cells were alkaline lysed and plasmid DNA was purified using magnetic beads, followed by quantification with the PicoGreen assay. The PicoGreen assay reported median and average yields of approximately 9.5 and 10 micrograms per sample, respectively, which are equivalent to 7.6 and 8 micrograms per mL of bacterial culture. Plasmid DNA concentrations measured by the PicoFluor fluorometer were consistently lower than those obtained using the NanoDrop UV spectrophotometer. The comparison demonstrated robust positive correlation between PicoGreen assay and NanoDrop measurements (R-squared > 0.8). Among 480 plasmid DNA samples, average and median yields measured by the NanoDrop reached approximately 24 and 25 micrograms per sample per well, corresponding to 19 and 20 micrograms per mL of bacterial culture. Over 98% of samples exceeded the high-yield threshold of 10 micrograms per mL of culture, with high plasmid quality validated through DNA gel electrophoresis.

However, translating these genetic insights into effective patient management poses significant challenges, since the impact of gene variants on physiological function and clinical outcomes is not yet fully understood. Therefore, there is an urgent need for large-scale methods to assess the effects of genetic variants on cardiomyocyte physiology and to establish correlations between functional phenotypes and clinical severity. Methods: We developed a high throughput imaging platform to measure force generation and calcium handling throughout the cardiac cycle of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). By expressing variants of a sarcomeric protein [cardiac Troponin-I (TNNI3)] in a healthy genetic background, we were able to assess sarcomeric calcium sensitivity as well as systolic and diastolic function. Analysis of these parameters distinguished subgroups of variants, and permitted the correlation of in vitro physiological effects with a measure of disease severity in a single-center cardiomyopathy cohort. Results: Combining contractile force and calcium cycling measurements accurately distinguished known pathogenic from non-pathogenic TNNI3 variants and also revealed pathogenicity of two variants of unknown significance (VUS) that occurred in two families, suggesting the ability to prospectively discern pathogenicity. Clustering of TNNI3 variants based on quantitative physiological phenotypes identified subgroups that correlated with age of disease onset across a well-characterized cardiomyopathy patient cohort, showing clinical relevance of the in vitro phenotypes. Interestingly, normalized measures of in vitro diastolic function correlated with age of onset (R2 = 0.6), but calcium sensitivity, which accurately predicted pathogenicity, did not translate into disease severity. Conclusions: A high throughput in vitro platform that measures multidimensional cardiomyocyte function can link subgroups of human genetic variants in TNNI3 with differential patient outcomes. Comprehensive determination of variant effects on disease-relevant cardiomyocyte function will help classify variants into different pathogenic mechanisms leading to variable disease severity, and potentially lead to class-targeted ameliorative strategies.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

A major challenge in understanding and controlling these systems lies in making accurate, photorealistic predictions of emergent patterns that reflect both the governing biophysical rules and the fine-scaled visual features observed experimentally. Such predictions are essential for interpreting experimental observations and for guiding rational design in contexts where patterning governs system behavior, such as microbial consortia, tissue morphogenesis, and spatially structured biomanufacturing. Mechanistic models can reproduce global morphological patterns but lack visual details; purely data-driven generative models produce visually plausible images that are not grounded in underlying biology.

However, when administered intravenously, oncolytic viruses are often hampered by neutralization from anti-bodies, reducing their antitumor efficacy.

In this study, human glioblastoma xenografts were orthotopically implanted in immunocompromised ICR mice. The therapeutic agents (VV-GMCSF-Lact-Apt1, VV-GMCSF-Lact-Apt2 or VV-GMCSF- Lact) were administered intravenously. Using magnetic resonance imaging, we observed a decrease in tumor growth in all experimental groups.

The level of key cytokines (IL-1, IL-10, TNF-alpha) in mouse plasma was measured using ELISA. A study of cytokine levels (IL-1, IL-10, and TNF-) showed that the aptamers shift the immune response from a pro-inflammatory systemic response, by reducing IL-1, to an anti-tumor one, with an increase in TNF-. In histological analysis, the most destructive changes in tumor tissue were observed in the VV-GMCSF-Lact-Apt2 group, while the morphology of organ tissues (spleen, liver, kid-neys and lungs) did not differ between the control and experimental groups.

Here, we identify Reprimo (RPRM), a p53-inducible tumor suppressor, is a potent inhibitor of NHEJ in which RPRM promotes proteasomal degradation of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) phosphorylated at the T2609 site. Upon irradiation, RPRM quickly translocates into the nucleus to enhance the transcription of FBXW11, a F-box protein gene that encodes the substrate recognition component of SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complex. In the nucleus, RPRM is also able to scaffold the assembly of the SCF(FBXW11) E3 ligase complex by binding to both CUL1 and FBXW11. This complex can specifically ubiquitylate phosphorylated DNA-PKcs (T2609), leading to reduced levels of both phosphorylated DNA-PKcs (T2609) and total DNA-PKcs, thereby suppressing NHEJ-driven repair and enhancing tumor radiosensitivity. In consistence, inhibiting the SCF(FBXW11) E3 ligase complex eliminates RPRM-mediated radiosensitization by protecting DNA-PKcs. Clinically, high RPRM expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) predicts better patient prognosis. Moreover, RPRM expression correlates positively with FBXW11 and PRKDC (DNA-PKcs) in the tumor tissues of the NSCLC patient cohort. Significantly, high expression of RPRM protein is linked to enhanced radiosensitivity of patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from these NSCLC patients.

T.", "abstract": "Most deaths from cancer are caused by their metastases. Along with the ability to evade the immune system and to invade and disrupt very different tissue environments, metastases usually develop resistance to whatever therapeutic approaches are tried. Their extreme adaptability requires a diversity of traits from which natural selection can choose, but current models, such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), do not directly address how this diversity is generated. We observed that single cell clones of Panc1 human pancreas cancer cells that had had crispR knock outs (KO) of the gene for activin-like kinase 4 (ALK4) had developed a markedly diverse morphology. Time-lapse and fluorescence microscopy, FACS analysis and mitotic chromosome squashes provided evidence that the cells diversify profoundly in size, behavior and chromosome number. This diversity appears to develop through cytokinesis failure, the generation of very large multinuclear cells that exhibit a high range of nuclear configurations, coupled with continued cell divisions that sometimes generate three, four, and more daughter cells in one cell division. This astounding activity often resulted in cells that were much smaller than the normal Panc1 cells, and indirect evidence suggests they were significantly sub-ploidy, yet underwent regular cell divisions. A subset of the smaller cells were highly motile, and were observed to sometimes merge together or even into larger cells. This phenomenon could provide an unappreciated venue for transferring mutated genes, chromosome fragments, whole chromosomes or sets of chromosomes into an invaded cell. We suggest that these observations may be a serendipitous illustration of the missing link between the genetic mutations implicated in the development of primary carcinoma, and the extreme genomic diversity that characterizes malignant metastases.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Here, we uncovered a previously undescribed post-translational strategy that cancer cells use to inactivate the potent mitochondrial tumor suppressor LACTB in breast cancers.

We show that cancer cells misuse this feature of LACTB to force LACTB into self-degradation. This is mechanistically realized through upregulation of mitochondrial MRPS34 protein, which, through interaction with LACTB, is a positive regulator of the autoproteolytic activity of LACTB and a negative regulator of LACTB.

We introduce a conceptually simple, computationally efficient latent variable model that infers both (i) the latent variables organizing population activity and (ii) whether their dynamics are continuous or fragmented in time. Fitting reduces to an expectation-maximization (EM) procedure that alternates two operations familiar to systems neuroscience--tuning-curve estimation and label decoding--without requiring external labels. Applied to rodent hippocampal spike recordings, the model reveals distinct population patterns at the same physical position that supervised spatial decoding fails to detect. While learned latents exhibit place-field-like tuning, their reactivation patterns are better distinguished by behavioral states. The model further identifies a continuity-fragmentation axis that characterizes population activities across sleep-wake brain states that is modulated by cholinergic inputs.

Within this global suppression, we identify a specialized, fail-safe architecture for arresting feeding. A redundant ensemble of neurons (DNge031/CB0565) targets the premotor center Roundup, effectively disfacilitating motor output. Crucially, this inhibition is modular, anatomically distinct from grooming suppression, and relies on additive logic to ensure suppression even if individual components fail.

Here, we used a single-blind randomized crossover design with two within-participant factors, stimulation (right tVNS vs. sham) and metabolic state (water vs. caloric load), to investigate 54 healthy participants (210 sessions). To evaluate state-dependent changes in reinforcement learning, we used a valenced go/no-go task. Performance on this task can be used to estimate a Pavlovian choice bias, which captures improved performance for valence-congruent actions (e.g., go to win rewards) versus valence-incongruent actions (e.g., no-go to win rewards) and has been associated with dopaminergic neurotransmission. In line with theorized state-dependency of tVNS-induced changes, we observed that tVNS decreased Pavlovian response biases (Go x Win) after the caloric load (Stimulation x Load: p = .038). Taking into account individual changes in hunger but not satiety ratings best captured behavioral modulation, indicating that this modulatory effect could be driven by motivational effects related to metabolic interoception (sensed \"need\"). We conclude that right tVNS decreases Pavlovian response biases if the body is in a postprandial, but not a fasting state. Since fasting and Pavlovian biases have been previously associated with elevated dopamine neurotransmission, our results call for additional research on state-dependent motivational effects of tVNS to optimize interventions.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

L.; Maynard, K. L.; Kalender, G.; Widge, A.

A key contributor to this variability may be state-dependent effects of brain stimulation, where activity in underlying circuits can shape the propagation of TMS-evoked activity. Thus, pushing target circuits into a desired state by engaging cognition may sensitise those circuits to TMS-evoked plasticity. We tested whether TMS effects on cognitive control, a transdiagnostic construct implicated across psychiatric disorders and a putative mediator of TMS efficacy, are state-dependent. Participants (N = 25) completed a context-dependent behavioural assay of cognitive control before and after we delivered rTMS to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). During rTMS, participants performed either the cognitive control task (active-state TMS), or performed a context-independent perceptual task (control-state TMS). We assessed changes in downstream behavioural metrics of circuit function, as well as neural indices of cognitive control measured from electroencephalography (EEG). rTMS enhanced cognitive control performance only when PFC-anchored control circuits were actively engaged during stimulation. Similarly, only active-state TMS modulated theta band oscillatory activity, which is thought to be a marker of cognitive control engagement. Moreover, modulation of those EEG indices by TMS predicted gains in behavioural performance in the cognitive control task. These findings demonstrate that TMS effects on cognitive control are state-dependent, in which endogenous engagement of PFC-anchored networks can shape the magnitude and functional relevance of TMS-induced plasticity. Considering cognitive states during TMS may therefore offer a framework to enhance and/or accelerate TMS therapeutic effects.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Loss of CLCC1/TMEM41B causes ER bilayer imbalance, inducing giant ER-enclosed lipid droplets (geLDs) and driving rapid progression into severe MASH. Here we identify CLCC1 as the long-missing client of the lumenal Torsin ATPases, which selectively engage oligomerized CLCC1 at sites of ER bilayer imbalance. Hepatic TorsinA inactivation triggers geLD formation amid disrupted lipoprotein biogenesis and severe MASH, closely phenocopying CLCC1/TMEM41B deficiency. Mechanistically, Torsins act as foldases that drive CLCC1 oligomerization for its recruitment to imbalanced bilayers. Remarkably, ectopic CLCC1 expression reverses cellular and systemic lipid disorders arising from hepatic TorsinA deficiency. Hence, Torsin ATPases emerge as fundamental regulators that organizes CLCC1 and the downstream TMEM41B scramblase to govern lipid partitioning and membrane homeostasis.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

However, these methods are constrained by limited temporal control and scalability. To address these challenges, we established a protocol for generating microglia from frozen mixed glial cultures. While freezing introduced measurable differences in microglial morphology and lipid droplet content, microglia derived from frozen cultures responded to environmental stimuli (high glucose and LPS) in the same way as those from fresh cultures. Thus, while frozen primary microglia exhibit similar functional responses, maintaining consistency in using fresh or frozen cells within a given experiment is strongly recommended.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Several imputation methods leave these artifacts largely intact, whereas graph abstraction restricted to homogeneously-observed cells alone recovers tree-like structures locally representing constrained cell state transitions. Simulations further demonstrate that realistic heterogeneous observation can create spurious subclusters and false branching. Grounded by these observations, we propose topological stability descriptors of low-dimensional manifold skeletons to delineate a regime in which manifold-based inference is trustworthy despite realistic heterogeneous observations.

As a proof of concept, we designed digoxin competitors and experimentally screened the binders using a simple bioluminescent assay, identifying 7/10 successful binders directly in bacterial lysate.

Apart from clarithromycin, antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results for Mycobacterium abscessus cannot guide antibiotic selection. AST involves measuring the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which is allowed to span a four-fold range in concentration. This accepted variability of the MIC limits the clinical utility of AST. Antimicrobial dose-response curves, obtained by measuring the growth inhibition of a given organism to increasing concentrations of an antibiotic, can yield metrics of antibiotic activity that are less variable than the MIC. We used Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute growth conditions for rapid-grower nontuberculous mycobacteria to generate 990 dose-response curves across three time points (72 hours, 96 hours, and 120 hours) for six guideline-recommended (clarithromycin, amikacin, cefoxitin, linezolid, tigecycline, and clofazimine) and five new (omadacycline, tedizolid, SPR719, SQ109, and bedaquiline) antibiotics against Mycobacterium abscessus subspecies abscessus ATCC 19977 and Mycobacterium peregrinum ATCC 700686. We established the fit of the dose-response curve (R2) as a quality control metric. Using the geometric standard deviation and median coefficient of variation, we demonstrated that the IC50 and IC75 (antibiotic concentrations corresponding to 50% and 75% growth inhibition, respectively) are less variable than the MIC. We identified time-dependent changes in dose-response curve metrics that allow the detection of inducible clarithromycin resistance with only five days of incubation.

Because it dynamically tunes the functional output of protein expression in cells, alternative splicing, a process by which different mRNAs can be generated from a single gene, is positioned to play a critical role in maintaining an equilibrated Mtb-macrophage host-pathogen interface. To gain insight into how alternative splicing shapes antimycobacterial immune responses, we used RNA-sequencing and splicing-aware computational pipelines to quantify alternative splicing in Mtb-infected bone marrow-derived murine macrophages. We found that ~5% of expressed macrophage genes exhibit one or more splicing changes at 8h post-Mtb infection, highlighting alternative splicing as a key regulatory node in the macrophage response to Mtb. We next sought to identify RNA binding proteins that play an outsized role in shaping the macrophage transcriptome during Mtb infection. We discovered that the splicing factor heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2B1 (hnRNPA2B1) promotes the early induction of inflammatory genes while dampening several type I interferon-stimulated genes in response to Mtb. HnRNPA2B1 also controls alternative splicing of many genes during Mtb infection, including Irgm1, a critical immunity-related GTPase. The balance of Irgm1-long vs. -short is differentially regulated in response to diverse inflammatory cues and macrophages overexpressing Irgm1-short are defective in autophagosomal targeting, lysosomal homeostasis, and restriction of Mtb replication.

Methods: We examined 400 Finnish children (180 girls, 220 boys) aged 7-9 years who provided stimulated saliva samples and underwent clinical oral examinations at baseline of the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children study. Of these children, 261 (65%) were with CF and 139 (35%) were without CF. We characterized the saliva microbiota using the 16S rRNA gene sequencing, examined differences in the abundance and composition at the phylum and genus level between these two groups, and studied the associations of selected Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with the risk of having CF in crude and adjusted (OTUs, age, Silness-Loe plaque index) models. Results: Alpha diversity and richness did not differ between the groups (p>0.1 for Shannon, inverse Simpson, and Chao1 indices) in the total sample nor when analyzed among girls and boys separately. Beta diversity differed between the groups in the total sample, and when girls and boys were analyzed separately (p corrected by false discovery rate method [pcorr] ~ 0.001).

TEsup proteins act in part by engaging nuclear exosome adaptor complexes at piRNA-targeted transcripts through a domain that recognizes proline-rich peptides. Disruption of the Piwi-TEsup-exosome axis leads to accumulation and nuclear export of piRNA-targeted transposon RNAs. Notably, the P-element, which evades heterochromatin-based repression, is silenced primarily through this RNA-decay pathway. Thus, the nuclear piRNA pathway couples target recognition to RNA degradation, reconciling small RNA-guided heterochromatin formation with ongoing transcription at target loci.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

G.; Macias, S.", "abstract": "The DICER1 gene is mutated in cancer, including DICER1 syndrome, a rare tumour predisposition syndrome. Cancer-associated hotspot mutations have been reported in both catalytic domains of DICER1 and are predicted to disrupt miRNA biogenesis. To understand how these hotspot mutations contribute to cancer development, we have generated cell lines harbouring single amino acid substitutions within the catalytic RNase IIIa (S1344L) or RNase IIIb (D1709N) domains of the endogenous DICER1 gene. We show that both mutations result in a widespread loss of 5p miRNAs, and, unexpectedly, an increase in 3p passenger strands loading into AGO2. The shared similarities between both mutants can be attributed to the structural proximity of the S1344 residue to the RNase IIIb catalytic centre. Functionally, we found that changes in the repertoire of miRNAs loaded into AGO2 result in altered gene expression, impacting critical pathways for cancer development, including metastatic potential. Additionally, our results indicate that inactivating the processing activity of DICER1 does not result in genomic instability. Instead, mutations cause specific upregulation of human endogenous retrovirus H (HERVH) through miRNA-independent mechanisms, suggesting that both canonical and non-canonical DICER1 functions are important to understand DICER1 syndrome.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Major shifts in physiology, reflecting these differences, are expected to be mediated by endocrine regulation, yet comparative data on the sources of inter-specific variation in hormone concentrations remain sparse, especially outside the Nearctic-Neotropic system. We examined variation in two key steroid hormones, corticosterone and testosterone, across 100 passerine species from Europe and the Afrotropics, sampled using standardized field protocols. Baseline levels of both hormones were consistently lower in tropical species, as expected. While stress-induced corticosterone reactivity did not differ between latitudes, it declined with migration distance. Testosterone levels were higher in males than females and declined with migration distance. In tropical species, neither hormone was associated with elevation, another source of environmental variation, but both varied during the breeding cycle, challenging the view of tropical aseasonality. This study broadens the perspective on endocrine correlates of avian life history evolution by testing their generality in an understudied Afrotropical-Palearctic system.

In this study, we re-evaluate evidence for Muller's ratchet with well-annotated mitochondrial and nuclear genomes from three species pairs. Across all three comparisons, mitochondrial tRNA (and protein-coding) genes are evolving under strong constraint, with dt/dS equal to 0.12 in primates, 0.07 in birds, and 0.04 in fruit flies.

The orthologs MraY and DPAGT1 are dimeric phosphoglycosyltransferases involved in oligosaccharide biosynthesis for either bacterial peptidoglycan or eukaryotic N-linked glycans, respectively. Both enzymes play central regulatory roles, making them attractive targets for antibacterial and anticancer therapies. In our prior studies, a muraymycin A1-derived inhibitor termed APPB (aminouridyl phenoxypiperidinbenzyl butanamide) was developed. It exhibits sub-100 nM IC50 values against both MraY and DPAGT1 and has demonstrated efficacy against DPAGT1-dependent cancers, making it an excellent starting point for next-generation small molecules. To guide inhibitor development, we determined cryo-EM structures of APPB bound to MraY or DPAGT1 at 2.9 [A] resolution using single-particle analysis. The structures reveal that APPB, composed of a nucleoside, a central amide, and a lipid-mimetic, adopts two conformations in each protein, which correlate with local hydrogen-bonding contacts of the central amide carbonyl. Examination of the amide carbonyl environments guides conformer selection for future DPAGT1-targeting anticancer agents. Further, comparisons of APPB-bound geometries and nucleoside interactions inform opportunities for antibacterial agents targeting MraY. Overall, our study provides design principles for MraY- or DPAGT1-specific drugs and motivates the utility of simultaneously characterizing inhibitor-bound orthologs for selective therapeutics.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

However, operational pressures and insufficient training lead to frequent image classification and labeling errors by human operators. These critical data integrity issues include the mislabeling of rolled vs. flat fingerprints, out-of-sequence captures, and the insertion of incorrect modalities. Such errors render enrollment records unreliable, compromising subsequent identity verification processes. Since manually sorting vast image archives is unfeasible, our study proposes an automated solution. The primary objective was to deploy a Siamese Network to classify fingerprints by their precise finger type and collection methodology (flat or rolled impressions). A secondary, but central, goal was to investigate the influence of varying embedding dimensions (64, 128, 256, 512) and similarity thresholds (0.5, 0.2, 0.1) on the network's performance metrics. Our most significant finding demonstrates a clear trade-off: a lower similarity threshold drastically increases conditional accuracy and precision (e.g., up to 98%) but simultaneously increases the proportion of images categorized as \"uncertain\" (up to 24%). In a practical, large-scale application, this necessitates balancing superior classification accuracy against a higher volume of images requiring costly manual inspection. This work provides a proof-of-concept tool capable of efficiently quantifying the percentage of images requiring human review across various modalities (fingerprints, face, iris). The eventual goal is a lightweight, efficient tool to establish standard preprocessing procedures for any large biometric dataset, dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with data integrity maintenance.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Accordingly, manipulating mosquito gut microbiota is a promising avenue toward reducing mosquito-borne human pathogen transmission. A successful microbial control campaign will require a thorough understanding of how bacteria are transmitted through mosquito populations. Through two parallel but complementary studies using the yellow fever mosquito Aedes aegypti as a focal host species, we surveyed vertical transmission of bacteria from individual mothers to cohorts of offspring maintained in a closed system. Results Laboratory- and field-derived mothers deposited bacteria that support offspring development, and the relative abundance of commonly transmitted taxa correlated with offspring fitness. Maternally transmitted bacteria were detected in both larval and adult offspring, and the relative abundances of specific taxa differed between life stages. Microbiota composition in adult offspring closely resembled microbiota composition in mothers, despite dramatic shifts in the relative abundance of specific microbial community members during the larval stage. Variability in microbiota composition in offspring was also greater than variability across the population of egg-laying mothers. Eggs that underwent a period of desiccation before hatching produced larval communities dominated by endospore-forming bacteria that were rare in maternal samples.

While methionine oxidation is known to impair phase separation, neither the precise mechanism nor the specific contribution of methionines in the CR compared to the IDRs has been determined. Here, we combine NMR spectroscopy and all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to reveal if and how methionine oxidation in each region differentially affects CTD structure and phase separation. We demonstrate that all methionine residues are vulnerable to oxidation, leading to distinct regional effects: oxidation of CR methionines disrupts helical structure and directly impairs intermolecular helical association, while oxidation of IDR methionines disrupts long-range contacts. Hence, oxidation of methionines in both regions contributes to impaired phase separation, albeit through different mechanisms. These findings establish methionines as critical redox-sensitive modulators of TDP-43 phase behavior and provide molecular insights into how oxidative stress may contribute to TDP-43 dysregulation in neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Recent molecular and imaging studies suggest non-cycling cellular states exist along a continuum of deepening dormancy, whereby the probability of cell cycle re-entry decreases with distance from the restriction point. We trained a probabilistic deep-learning model that enables mapping of heterogeneous single cell transcriptomic datasets into an interpretable latent space that encodes a common \"dormancy pseudotime\". We demonstrate that our model enables robust inference of active cell cycle states, and validate in diverse biological contexts that the inferred location along dormancy pseudotime represents a continuum from quiescence to durably arrested states. Applying dormancy pseudotime inference to pre- and post-treatment time points from patients undergoing anti-cancer treatment, we uncover new insights into the distinct tumour cell dormancy states targeted by immune checkpoint inhibitors and platinum-taxane chemotherapy. Given the ubiquity of single cell transcriptomics, we anticipate that dormancy pseudotime analysis will be widely applied to shed new light on the complex interplay between cycling and non-cycling cellular states in health and disease.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

The recent completion of the Full Adult Fly Brain (FAFB) connectome offers an opportunity to map these sensory inputs and their downstream circuits. While the external gustatory receptor neurons have been relatively well characterized, the internal pharyngeal and gut sensory neurons remain less understood. Here, we systemically identify their axonal projections in the FAFB connectome and examine their downstream circuits. We find that the stomodeal nerve, which carries afferent signals from the gastrointestinal tract to the brain, contains multiple types of sensory axons with distinct morphology and downstream output connections. In addition, we identify sensory axons derived from different pharyngeal sense organs and find that chemosensory and mechanosensory axons arborize in distinct regions of the subesophageal zone. Characterization of the second- and third-order neurons reveals the major brain regions that receive input from pharyngeal and gut sensory neurons. Interestingly, a subset of these internal sensory neurons forms monosynaptic connections with various motor neurons and endocrine cells, suggesting that internal signals from the pharynx and gut may directly influence feeding-related motor programs and endocrine output. Together, our study delineates the pharyngeal and gut sensory circuits, laying a foundation for future studies on how internal sensory signals regulate feeding behavior and endocrine functions.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Of particular significance was the demonstration more than three decades ago that LA-2 equivalent antibody titers, defined by a competitive-inhibition ELISA, serve as a reliable correlate of vaccine-induced protection across different species, including humans. In vitro characterization of LA-2 has identified both complement-dependent and -independent activities, although which of these attributes contribute to protection against B. burgdorferi remains unresolved. To address this issue, we generated and characterized an \"Fc-silent\" version of LA-2 IgG1 carrying so-called LALAPG substitutions (L234A, L235A, P329G). We demonstrate that LA-2 LALAPG retained OspA binding activity but was severely attenuated in in vitro complement deposition and complement-dependent borreliacidal assays. Nonetheless, LA-2 LALAPG was as effective as LA-2 at passively protecting C3H mice against nymphal tick-mediated B. burgdorferichallenge. LA-2 LALAPG was also equivalent to LA-2 in passively protecting BALB/c mice against intradermal B. burgdorferi challenge. In the intradermal challenge model, viable spirochetes were not recoverable 24 h after injection from skin biopsies of mice treated with LA-2 or LA-2 LALAPG, and an influx of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to the injection site was abrogated. Collectively, these results suggest that LA-2s primary mode of action involves direct physical interactions with the spirochete rather than complement-dependent killing. Elucidating these mechanisms may have implications for understanding the mechanistic correlates of OspA-based vaccine-induced immunity in humans.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

We recently developed a set of compost that can biodegrade PLA at mesophilic conditions, and one possible reason underlying our success could be due to the enrichment of PLA hydrolyzability. Here, we investigated the potential selection of bioactivities related to PLA breakdown in our trained compost and surveyed the occurrences of those activities in the environment for comparison. Ten different environments were sampled, including PLA, larval gut of black soldier flies, and organic material from our trained compost, as well as terrestrial soil, estuarine sediment, brackish water, shell biofilm, coastal stranded polystyrene, bottle, and bottle cap. We found a small fraction of cultivable bacteria in many samples that harbored PLA degradability. For our trained compost, PLA-degrading isolates were twice as efficient as those from other environments, even though the frequency at which they were detected was not significantly higher. These findings suggested that PLA breakdown ability is commonly present at a low percentage in most environments, and that our trained compost has been able to select for more effective isolates. As this enhancement is likely insufficient to explain the increase in PLA compostability in our trained compost compared to standard mesophilic composts, we propose that additional microbial activities are needed to act synergistically and overcome the requirement for elevated temperature in PLA composting.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Mesh1 deficiency affects sleep behavior and eclosion under starvation in Drosopila, and ferroptosis in human cells. However, human Mesh1 also exhibits NADPH/NADP+ phosphatase activity in vitro, making it unclear whether these phenotypes result from loss of ppGpp hydrolysis, NADPH/NADP+ dephosphorylation, or both. To address this, we performed biochemical and genetic analysis of Drosophila Mesh1. We first found that Drosophila Mesh1 dephosphorylates NADPH, but not NADP+, in vitro. We subsequently sought to generate Drosophila Mesh1 point mutants specifically impaired in NADPH phosphatase activity. Based on structural data, we mutated W138 and R142, residues that are predicted to interact with NADPH but not ppGpp. W138 was replaced with phenylalanine results in complete loss of NADPH phosphatase activity with retained ppGpp hydrolase activity. Flies carrying the W138F mutation, introduced via genome editing, exhibited shortened total sleep and increased sleep fragmentation in behavioral assays, without changes in intracellular ppGpp levels.

Here we sought to model inhibited DNA2 states using dominant genetics with separation-of-function alleles to identify the optimal mechanisms for DNA2 targeting. We find that expression of DNA2 nuclease-dead alleles exert dominant effects on fitness and DNA damage repair that are dependent on its helicase and RPA binding activities. Furthermore, we find an imperfect link wherein a subset of ALT+ models are hypersensitive to the presence of DNA2-nuclease dead protein.

A.", "abstract": "Objectives: Studies documented the association of melanoregulin (MREG), a cargo-sorting protein, with its binding partner, the autophagic protein, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) in macrophages which could affect bone physiology due to the importance of autophagy in osteoclast function. Herein we propose to test the hypothesis that MREG modulates bone remodeling. Therefore, we analyzed the Mregdsu/dsu mutant mice for bone mass, growth plate microarchitecture, and bone marrow-derived osteoclast function to understand how lack of MREG affects bone and mass at two different time points. Methods: Mice femurs from wild type and MREG-/- male mice (on C57BL6)/J background) were harvested at 4 and 10 months and imaged by microcomputed tomography to assess bone mass parameters. Femurs were processed for histology by H&E and TRAP staining for assessment of osteoclast numbers. Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages from 3-week-old mice were harvested to assess osteoclast differentiation and function via TRAP, resorptive assay and Western Blot for osteoclast differentiation markers. In addition, a separate cohort of mice were analyzed via EchoMRI to characterize total lean vs. fat whole body mass. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in bone volume of 10-month old mice in wild type vs. MREG-/- with MREG mutation suggesting a preservative effect on phenotypical bone parameters as the mice age. A reduction in adipose tissue but an increase in osteoclast numbers was found histologically in MREG mutant femurs. Bone marrow-derived cells, however, showed reduced osteoclastic function in MREG-/-. The mutant mice presented a total lean mass significantly increased compared to wild type per EchoMRI. Conclusions: MREG deficiency seems to impact osteoclast numbers in vivo but not in vitro, although in vitro function was reduced. MREG deficiency favors lean mass preservation over fat accumulation in bones and body composition as mice age. This study provides the foundation for a more in-depth investigation of MREG's role in bone and systemic metabolism. It is possible that MREG can be a future target for new therapeutic modalities in inflammatory and metabolic bone diseases.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

A high-mucin sub-type of ductal cells had relatively preserved abundance, altered localization and up-regulated stress, secretion and pro-fibrotic activity in CF, and conventional ductal cells showed evidence for transition to the high-mucin state. Increased inflammatory and fibrotic pathway activity in CF was linked to closer proximity and crosstalk between immune and stellate cells in specific niches. Beta cells had extensive genomic changes in CF, including increased stress and insulin secretion-related processes, and these changes were broadly distinct from those in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Islets in CF preferentially localized near large adipose tissue and collagen structures, and both areas were strongly linked to beta cell loss in CF due to signaling from adipocytes, macrophages, stellate, and high-mucin ductal cells.

The development of therapeutics that stimulate myelin repair to treat demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis is hampered by the inability to distinguish newly-synthesised from pre-existing myelin. This study aimed to develop a method to quantify and localise new myelin lipid synthesis in vivo. Deuterium oxide was administered for two weeks in the drinking water of mice fed normal chow, chow containing the demyelinating toxin cuprizone, or during spontaneous remyelination following cuprizone withdrawal. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and mass spectrometry imaging were used to quantify and localise the newly synthesised, deuterated lipids.

Deuterated hexosylceramide and phosphatidylethanolamine plasmalogen species were localised primarily to the corpus callosum, the white matter tract that is most heavily affected by cuprizone.

While previous studies show that these structures can form by competitive Hebbian learning, the relationship between system parameters and the resulting organizational patterns remains unclear. Here, we use a mesoscopic model of V1 development to explain how the different observed patterns of ocular dominance (columns, islands, and monocular) can arise through local Hebbian competition, as a function of the density of projections from each eye and cortical interaction strengths. We argue that our results explain the broad cortical organizational differences between species which have forward-facing versus steeply angled eyes.

Photoplethysmography (PPG)-derived timing markers such as pulse arrival time (PAT) are frequently used as noninvasive surrogates of BP dynamics, yet their interpretation is confounded by the pre-ejection period and peripheral vascular effects. Here, we used detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to quantify short- and long-term scaling exponents of continuous blood pressure (Portapres), PPG-, and PAT-derived signals across sleep stages in healthy individuals and patients with OSA. Directly measured systolic and diastolic BP exhibited a robust short- to long-term crossover across all sleep stages, with elevated short-range exponents (1> 1) and lower long-range exponents (2< 1), reflecting well-organized autonomic and vascular control. In OSA, this crossover persisted but was visibly attenuated, consistent with reduced short-term adaptability of cardiovascular regulation. In contrast, PAT-based indices showed substantially weaker short-range correlations and minimal crossover structure. Systolic PAT displayed almost no separation between 1 and 2, and PPG-derived measures exhibited scaling patterns that differed fundamentally from BP. Across modalities, PAT (whether derived from BP or PPG) failed to reproduce the multiscale organization characteristic of beat-to-beat BP dynamics. Group comparisons further identified systolic BP scaling, particularly the short-range exponent 1, as the most sensitive marker of cardiovascular dysregulation in OSA, whereas PAT and PPG provided complementary but physiologically distinct information related to peripheral vascular and autonomic modulation. These findings demonstrate that PAT and PPG timing measures should not be used as surrogates for BP in fractal or scaling analyses and underscore the unique diagnostic value of BP-derived scaling behavior for assessing cardiovascular regulation during sleep.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

The insular cortex is critically involved in interoceptive processing and impulsivity regulation, and its activity is powerfully shaped by parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons. We hypothesized that developmental differences in PV interneuron activity within the insular cortex contribute to impulsivity-related behaviors and alcohol consumption. To investigate this, male C57BL/6 mice were assessed at two developmental stages: adolescence (postnatal day 28) and young adulthood (postnatal day 64). Impulsivity was measured using the Omission-Contingency Learning (OCL) task, while alcohol intake and preference were evaluated using a two-bottle choice paradigm. Adolescent mice displayed higher impulsivity and greater alcohol consumption than adults. Double immunofluorescence labeling (Fos+/NeuN+ and Fos+/PV+) showed that increased impulsivity was associated with reduced activation of PV interneurons in the insular cortex. Chemogenetic activation of PV interneurons in adult PV-Cre mice reduced impulsivity in the OCL task and decreased alcohol intake.

Most of the input are in the form of large mossy fibers and small boutons containing round synaptic vesicles and forming asymmetric synapses. A smaller number of inputs arise from the lateral reticular nucleus and the spinal trigeminal nucleus that contain pleomorphic synaptic vesicles implying inhibitory action. This circumstance positions the GCD for integrating polysensory excitatory and inhibitory inputs at the earliest stages of auditory processing, which suggests a role for segregating sound streams. The structural substrate for such a function is naturally elaborate. Mossy fibers from these different origins are large, multilobed endings that form synaptic glomeruli with postsynaptic targets that include granule cells, unipolar brush cells, cartwheel cells, and chestnut cells, which in turn project to principal cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Numerous synapses contribute to the integration of the different modalities, but the organization of these synapses is still not well understood. We investigated this issue by labelling the presynaptic endings of different somatosensory inputs using biotinylated dextran amine or Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin, and studying their post-synaptic relationships in the GCD. The anterogradely-labeled endings and associated targets were visualized by light and electron microscopy. Following computer-aided, three-dimensional reconstructions, we found that unipolar brush cells are the main target of the C2 DRG and cuneate nucleus. Mossy fibers from the spinal trigeminal nucleus project to Golgi cells, an inhibitory neuron. In contrast, inhibitory boutons originated from the lateral reticular nucleus.

Here, we uncover that DNA G quadruplexes are critical determinants of pre-mRNA splicing. G4s on the DNA template strand serve as recruiting elements for the RNA-binding proteins SRSF9 and WBP11 in order to facilitate productive splicing of adjacent pre-mRNAs. This process is controlled by protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) that releases SRSF9 and WBP11 from G4s through arginine methylation. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase very long-chain specific (ACADVL) is a gene highly regulated by this mechanism since targeting G4 stability prevents mis-splicing and restores ACADVL protein levels. In the heart, deletion of Prmt5 recapitulates defective splicing and results in progressive cardiac failure along with loss of ACADVL in mice. Importantly, we find that Acadvl regulation plays a critical role for cardiomyopathy as restoring Acadvl expression in Prmt5 knockout mice prevents cardiac dysfunction.

We postulate that for specific interpretation of the heterogeneous environment, where the space available for free diffusion within an energid is assumed to be proportional to the embryo size, a change in the embryo size can lead to a size-dependent scaling of the gradient lengthscale. We further study a two component model with slow and fast diffusing Bicoid, and identify this model to be equivalent to the heterogeneous diffusion model further postulating that the fast-state occupancy which is a measure of the fraction of time spent in the fast diffusing state, should also scale with the embryo size via the energid size. Finally, we incorporate nuclear shuttling into our model to understand the effect of shuttling on the gradient lengthscale and scaling with embryo size. We argue that for the particular case where the degradation within the nucleus is low, nuclear shuttling does not perturb the Bicoid gradient. Our study suggests that scaling of the gradient length scale is possible due to spatial heterogeneity and does not depend on nuclear trapping as suggested previously.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Using genomes from Todoroki and Chidorikubo sites, we estimated Jomon ancestry in mainland Japanese at ~20%, substantially higher than previous estimates (~13%). Polygenic score analyses, based on the direct analysis of Jomon genomes, provided the genetic evidence for their phenotypic predispositions, including elevated BMI and metabolic trait scores, reduced immune-related scores, and larger cardiac dimensions, patterns consistent with hunter-gatherer adaptations.

However, emerging evidence suggests that extracellular transthyretin (TTR) aggregates are internalized and result in an intracellular stress response, including elevated Hsp70 levels. While ATTR research has predominantly focused on extracellular TTR amyloid, our understanding of TTR aggregation inside the cell is poorly explored. To better understand how intracellular chaperones impact intracellular TTR, we used a yeast model that expresses TTR fused eGFP (TTR-eGFP) within the cytoplasm. Since the Hsp70 chaperone family, and co-chaperones the J-domain proteins (JDPs) and Hsp110, act as a disaggregase in vitro, we asked how these molecular chaperones impact TTR aggregation intracellularly in vivo. TTR-eGFP forms detergent-soluble high molecular weight (HMW) aggregates in yeast that have biochemistry profiles similar to human patient TTR. While knockdown of the JDP, Sis1, and deletion of the Hsp110, Sse1, appear to slightly increase TTR-eGFP aggregation, the loss of two major yeast Hsp70s, Ssa1 and Ssa2, lead to a significant increase in the size of HMW species. Taken together, our data suggest that Hsp70s limit the formation of HMW TTR aggregates in the intracellular environment. Based on our results, it is possible that the age-related decline of protein homeostasis, including Hsp70s, may promote the intracellular aggregation of TTR.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

Although structurally conserved, SNTXs exhibit marked antigenic variation that can limit the effectiveness of regional antivenoms used for snakebite envenoming in Asia. Here, we evaluated the immunoreactivity of the Philippine Cobra Antivenom (PCAV) and three regional products--Naja kaouthia Monovalent Antivenom (NkMAV), Neuro Bivalent Antivenom (NBAV), and Indonesian SABU--against a panel of cobra venoms and purified -neurotoxins. PCAV bound strongly to homologous N. philippinensis SNTX but showed weak cross-reactivity with SNTXs from N. kaouthia, N. sputatrix, and N. atra, and minimal recognition of marine elapid SNTXs and long-chain -neurotoxins (LNTXs) of Monocled Cobra as well as King Cobra. Conversely, NkMAV and NBAV recognized mainland Asian SNTXs more broadly but reacted poorly with the Philippine cobra toxin. Hierarchical clustering of normalized immunoreactivity delineated two major SNTX antigenic subtypes corresponding to Philippine versus continental Asian lineages. Peptide sequence analysis unmasked two distinct loop-II motifs (28WWS-TII37 and 28RWR-YRT37) associated with these divergent immunotypes. Phylogenetic reconstruction suggests that the Philippine cobras retain an ancestral SNTX motif, while Sundaic and East Asian cobras have diversified to employ another major SNTX form. Epitope prediction further revealed differences in surface exposure and accessibility that help explain the limited cross-neutralization across antivenoms. These findings demonstrate a clear antigenic dichotomy among Asian cobra SNTXs, which underlies species-specific antivenom effectiveness and highlights the need to incorporate representative SNTX variants into immunogen formulations to improve regional antivenom coverage.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}

While many comparative approaches have been developed for detection of endogenous modifications, fewer have explored the expansion of SHAPE-based methods. We introduce Dashing Turtle (DT), an algorithm using probabilistic, weighted, stacked ensemble learning to perform high-resolution detection of structural modifications that can capture detailed information about RNA architecture across dynamic structural landscapes. We apply our method to several well-characterized RNA samples, identify dominant conformations, and structurally conserved regions. We show that our landscapes correlate well with expected structures and recapitulate important functional elements. DT achieves accuracy 10-20% higher than comparable methods on many sequences. It accurately identifies structural features at a rate of 80-100%, approximately 10-30% better than its peers.

It works as a ParA concentration based Brownian ratchet, which ensures the partition fidelity by operating at the critical point in its parameter space and localizing the ParA nearby to buffer against the large fluctuations in the ParA intracellular concentration. Despite these progresses, our understanding of the ParABS driven partition mechanism remains incomplete. It is not understood what causes the large cell-to-cell fluctuation in the ParA intracellular concentration and why the bacterium cannot minimize this noise to better control the partition fidelity. We present experimental evidence with low copy number F plasmids in E. coli that ParA robustly oscillates from pole to pole along the nucleoid length, underlying the observed large fluctuations in ParA intracellular concentration. Our theory experiment synergy demonstrates that the ParA oscillation hinges on the nucleoid dimension and the ParB mediated negative feedback with ParA in nucleoid binding. We suggest that the low copy number plasmid manages its partition fidelity with autonomy: The plasmid harnesses the same ParB mediated negative feedback that dissociates the ParA from the nucleoid underneath the plasmid to maintain the nucleoid-bound ParA at a proper level further away. And the ParA oscillation is reminiscent of this underlying feedback mechanism, which adapts the partition fidelity to the nucleoid growth.

The present study aims to recover and analyze the full skeletal assemblage, establishing its chronological framework, taxonomic identification, and comparative craniometry with other ancient and modern Eurasian lynxes. Radiocarbon dating estimates the specimen around 210 years BP, representing the most recent confirmed occurrence of Eurasian lynx in the Iberian Peninsula. This evidence revises the accepted timeline for the species' extirpation in the region, indicating its persistence into the early 19th century, connecting physical evidence with historical and traditional narratives. Morphometric analysis identifies the individual as an adult male with an estimated body mass of 19.7 kg. Comparative osteometric analyses revealed that the specimen from Sima Topinoria falls within the average size for modern males from the Carpathian population, while being significantly smaller than older Holocene males from the Iberian Peninsula (~2570 yBP), suggesting a possible trend toward a protohistoric body size reduction in the Holocene, akin to patterns reported for other mammalian fauna from the Cantabrian Mountains.

In fMRI, metastability has emerged as a reliable and robust summary measure of brain dynamics. Here, we set out to test the hypothesis that metastability is associated with connectome fingerprinting in naturalistic fMRI. We further examined whether this putative association varies with time scales, across brain functional networks, and depending on the movie content. Methods: We analyzed fMRI data from 86 participants of the Naturalistic Neuroimaging Database. Data was collected during movie-watching of 10 entire movies of different genres. Global and network-level metastability were calculated using an fMRI-appropriate proxy measure based on the variability of spatial coherence. The within-subject stability (Iself) and between-subjects similarity (Iothers) of individual functional connectomes were also calculated. Linear mixed-effects models and appropriate contrasts were used to test associations between metastability and fingerprinting indices. Results: At the whole-brain level and considering data from all movies, an association across windows was found between metastability, Iself, and Iothers, with stronger effects observed for larger windows, such as the 600-second window (Iself: b = -0.13, SE = 0.032, p < 0.001; Iothers: b = -0.23, SE = 0.028, p < 0.001). Associations were also observed with distinct magnitudes within the eight large-scale functional networks, with particularly strong effects in the Motor Network (Iself: b = -0.34, SE = 0.027, p < 0.001; Iothers: b = -0.27, SE = 0.021, p < 0.001). Although no whole-brain differences were observed, movie content exhibited distinct association patterns within networks, notably for the prediction of Iself in the Visual Network for 500 Days of Summer ({Delta} = -0.22, SE = 0.11, p = 0.043). For Iothers, significant between-movie differences were found in the AMN ({Delta} = -0.25, SE = 0.062, p < 0.001), Dorsal Attention ({Delta} = 0.16, SE = 0.08, p = 0.038), Ventral Attention ({Delta} = 0.14, SE = 0.060, p = 0.017), and Visual Networks ({Delta} = -0.17, SE = 0.081, p = 0.031). Conclusion: Metastability is systematically related to functional connectome fingerprints. This relationship is time-scale dependent, varies across functional networks, and is sensitive to movie content.

In primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells, the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor MPTP/MPP triggered caspase-3 activation, GSDME cleavage, and lytic membrane rupture. Genetic silencing of Gsdme or its transcriptional regulator SP1 reduced neuronal death. In vivo, Gsdme deficiency preserved substantia nigra pars compacta dopaminergic neurons, improved motor performance, and mitigated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors after MPTP administration. Loss of Gsdme also dampened microglial and astrocytic activation and lowered proinflammatory cytokines in striatum and substantia nigra. Mechanistically, cleaved GSDME localized to mitochondria, disrupted membrane potential, increased reactive oxygen species, and precipitated organelle injury, thereby coupling mitochondrial dysfunction to pyroptotic cell death.

Genetic inhibition of PPARg; acetylation at K268 and K293 dissociates the major adverse effects of TZDs from insulin sensitization and other metabolic improvements. We therefore posit that chemical inhibition of PPARg acetylation would elicit insulin sensitization with improved safety. Here we describe the identification of a synthetic thiopyrimidine derivative (TPMD) that acts as a small molecule inhibitor of PPARg acetylation. TPMD improves insulin sensitivity, promotes brown remodeling of white adipose tissue (WAT), increases energy expenditure, and decreases adiposity in dietary and genetic mouse models of T2D. Importantly, TPMD is deprived of the major side effects of TZDs, including weight gain, fluid retention, cardiac hypertrophy, bone marrow adiposity, and bone loss. X-ray crystallography at 2.0 A resolution reveals a unique binding mode of TPMD molecules to the PPARg; ligand-binding domain and provides structural and molecular basis for the acetylation inhibitory activity of TPMD together with site-directed mutagenesis studies. These findings identify TPMD as a first-in-class compound that specifically targets PPARg acetylation and possesses the potential of developing into a safe insulin sensitizer to treat and prevent T2D and obesity.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Machine learning-based development of Gadolinium binding peptides", "doi": "10.64898/2025.12.14.694215", "authors": "Dayan, N. A.; Long, M.; Miralavy, I.; Scalzitti, N.; Holmes, D.; Kocherovsky, M.; Banzhaf, W.; Gilad, A. A.", "abstract": "Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are indispensable tools in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), yet their clinical use is limited by non-specific tissue accumulation, low molecular specificity, and safety concerns. Protein and peptide scaffolds provide a promising alternative because they can bind metal ions with high selectivity and enable precise molecular targeting. However, identifying short peptide motifs with optimal gadolinium (Gd3+) coordination and high relaxivity remains a major challenge. Here, we used a machine-learning-driven peptide evolution platform, the Protein Optimization Engineering Tool (POET), to design and optimize short Gd-binding motifs that enhance longitudinal relaxivity (r1). Two algorithmic strategies were tested; motif-based and regular-expression-based representations, both were trained on an initial set of 74 twelve-amino-acid peptides derived from natural EF-hand scaffolds. Through two rounds of directed evolution and experimental screening, we identified peptides with up to a 24% increase in r1 ratio compared with the best natural EF-hand, and a 55% improvement in absolute r1 after removal of unbound Gd. Further analysis revealed that peptides exhibiting higher relaxivity generally possessed a more negative net charge and lower isoelectric point than the buffer pH, indicating stronger electrostatic stabilization of Gd3+. Sequence enrichment analysis showed that acidic and small polar residues, particularly aspartic acid, glycine, and threonine, were selectively favored during evolution, while bulky hydrophobic and basic residues were depleted. These compositional trends align with improved solubility and enhanced metal coordination. Together, these results demonstrate a generalizable framework that integrates computational evolution with biophysical screening to discover new biologically derived Gd-binding motifs. This approach provides a scalable route to engineer responsive, tunable, and biocompatible MRI contrast tags for precision imaging and molecular diagnostics.", "date": "2025-12-16", "journal": ""}
