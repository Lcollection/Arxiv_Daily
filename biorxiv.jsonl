Participants performed a two-alternative forced choice perceptual decision-making task at rest (pre- and post-exercise) and during six of eight 5-minute cycling bouts (totaling 47 minutes) under dual-task condition, while maintaining an average intensity of 86% of their maximum heart rate. Drift diffusion modeling was applied to accuracy and reaction time data to estimate changes in evidence accumulation (drift rate), decision threshold (boundary separation), and non-decision processes (ter). Results revealed improved post-exercise performance, characterized by shorter non-decision time, potentially reflecting a transient improvement in motor or perceptual efficiency. During ongoing physical activity, results suggest that exercise primarily enhances non-decision processes and improves the efficiency of evidence accumulation, while response caution remains stable. These findings provide novel insights into how sustained high-intensity exercise modulates perceptual decision-making dynamics under physiological stress.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that a morphogenetic innovation present in fly embryos--a deep epithelial fold known as the cephalic furrow--plays a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we find that the formation of the cephalic furrow prevents mechanical instabilities at the head-trunk epithelium by absorbing the compressive stresses generated by concurrent morphogenetic movements of gastrulation, the expansion of mitotic domains and the germ band extension. Furthermore, by comparing the expression of known and novel genes involved in cephalic furrow formation between fly species, we find that the presence of the cephalic furrow is linked to changes in the expression of buttonhead transcription factor at the head-trunk boundary. These data suggest that the genetic control of cephalic furrow formation was established through the integration of a new player into the ancestral head-trunk patterning system, and that mechanical instability may have been the selective pressure associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. Our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Actin network organization is regulated by a host of actin binding proteins. The Drosophila Synaptotagmin-like protein, Bitesize (Btsz), organizes actin at epithelial cell apical junctions in a manner that depends on its interaction with the actin-binding protein, Moesin. Using RNAi, we showed that Btsz functions at earlier, syncytial stages of Drosophila embryo development. Btsz is required to stabilize pseudo-cleavage furrows, preventing metaphase spindle collisions and nuclear fallout prior to cellularization. While previous studies have focused on Btsz function through Moesin, we find that phosphorylated Moesin localized to the nuclear envelope and was not enriched at pseudo-cleavage furrows, suggesting a Moesin-independent function for Btsz in syncytial embryos. Consistent with this, mutants that affected all Moesin binding domain isoforms did not recapitulate pan-isoform Btsz depletion and we find that the C-terminal half of Btsz cooperatively binds to and bundles F-actin. We propose that Synaptotagmin-like proteins directly regulate actin organization during syncytial Drosophila development.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

ALFA-K estimates fitness of thousands of karyotypes closely related to observed populations, enabling robust prediction of emergent karyotypes not yet experimentally detected. We validated ALFA-K's performance using synthetic data from an agent-based model and empirical data from in vitro and in vivo passaged cell lines.

Their signaling times range from seconds to minutes, indicating a uniquely flexible dark-state recovery mechanism. Unlike other light-sensors, the flavin chromophore is non-covalently bonded to the protein. Hence, the switching occurs via a change in the protein-flavin hydrogen-bond network, involving conserved residues transferring protons, tautomerizing, rotating, and approaching or leaving the chromophore pocket; triggering secondary structure displacements. The specific deactivation steps and residue roles have remained controversial. The detailed process is difficult to probe experimentally, and although simulations can track it, the computational effort is daunting. We combine forefront techniques to simulate, for the first time, explicit dynamics of the deactivation. A hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics scheme focuses the computational resolution in the flavin's vicinity, while our path-based methods sample the mechanism of dark-state recovery with high efficiency. Our protocol delivers free-energy profiles for the deactivation of two BLUF proteins, BlrB and AppA; corroborating a proposed mechanism based on the rotation and tautomerization of a conserved Gln. We find that the conformation of a Trp and a Met near the flavin is crucial to modulate the rate-determining barrier, which differs significantly between the BlrB and AppA proteins.

Laser lithotripsy, a minimally invasive treatment, uses laser energy to fragment urinary stones into smaller pieces, facilitating easier removal or natural passage. Among available laser technologies, the holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho:YAG) laser has established itself as the gold standard over the past three decades. Efforts to improve Ho:YAG laser ablation efficiency have largely focused on adjusting laser parameters such as pulse energy and frequency. In this study, we proposed a nanoplasmonic engineering strategy by incorporating nanoparticles (NPs) with strong near-infrared (NIR) absorption into the fluid surrounding the stone, enhancing the light-matter interaction.

The highly absorbing nanofluid accelerates vapor tunnel formation, boosts laser energy transmission to the stone, and permeates stone pores to enhance damage, without increasing thermal tissue injury risk.

With the advent of fluorescent speckle microscopy (FSM) and other technological advances in microscopy techniques, much more is now known about how the filamentous actin (F-actin) and microtubule (MT) networks work within cells to give rise to the vast array of functions which require them. A current challenge to the imaging field is to improve the utility and accuracy of the computational approaches required to analyze large and complex imaging datasets. Here, we present the results of a computational method that, when applied to FSM time-lapse series, can capture the instantaneous state of the rapidly changing, dense, and multi-directional speckle flows often exhibited by cytoskeletal dynamics in living systems. Re-analysis of previously published FSM image sets demonstrates that this method, which we call the Instantaneous Flow Tracking Algorithm (IFTA), can accurately detect speckle flows in mitotic spindles and F-actin meshworks, even in regions of high dynamicity of overlapping, anti-parallel flows where previous methods failed. Methods: The anti-parallel flow at the metaphase plate of the mitotic spindle is a well-known phenomenon during the initial stages of chromosome segregation and it has been measured by several approaches, mostly in stationary spindles which do not exhibit any polar rotation. The mitotic spindle is the target of many cancer and neurodegenerative drugs and as such, there has been many attempts at inhibiting its basic functions with the objective of preventing chromosome segregation and the formation of new daughter cells. Such attempts have largely been focused on the inhibition of the action of MT plus-end directed motors, for instance the kinesin KIF11. Spindles with inhibited kinesins have been thought to exhibit no MT flux, however IFTA measured regional flux of up to 2.7 um/min, which reveals the activity of potent secondary flux mechanisms. These results suggest novel, additional, approaches toward arresting cells in mitosis during patient treatment. Results: The traditional tracking methods erroneously measure zero flux in areas where contractile F-actin flows meet, denoted as a 'convergence zone' and commonly found in the lamella of motile cells and the neck of growth cones. When IFTA was used to analyze FSM datasets derived from these structures, we detected high rates of protein turnover, anti-parallel speckle motion, and fast flux of actin subunits in both directions in the same 'convergence zones'. This demonstrates the presence of a molecular machinery based on contractility in the lamella/lamellipodium of migrating cells and at the base of growing neurons, which can be exploited in the clinic. When applied to FSM data of migrating kangaroo rat kidney epithelial PtK1 cells overexpressing different isoforms of the actin-based motor tropomyosin, IFTA revealed distinct, isoform-specific effects on contractile F-actin flows. Specifically, we found that decreased affinity between tropomyosin and F-actin correlated with an increase in speckle velocity heterogeneity. Conclusions: Such quantitative imaging analysis offers the ability to reliably test novel therapeutics ex vivo. Significance statement: The main discoveries presented in the manuscript are related to the ability of the cell to adapt to a range of biochemical and mechanical perturbations. As cell therapy is becoming the forefront of precision medicine, it would be critical to anticipate the mechanisms of action of engineered immune cells. The pathways activated during therapy can be pinpointed by measuring its effects on the target proteins in patient-derived living cells. The clinical application of the approach outlined in this manuscript pertains to analyzing drug resistance in cancer therapy and the treatment of neurodegeneration. Our hypothesis is that targeting actin in resistant tumors could sensitize cancer cells to tubulin inhibitors. If this proves true, it will have implications in the clinic.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Polyamines interact electrostatically with DNA on the nucleosome core, freeing histone tails to conformations accessible to chromatin-modifying enzymes. Consistent with their role in increasing histone-tail accessibility, polyamines are able to replace MYC's role in reprogramming to pluripotency.

J.", "abstract": "Visual search relies on the ability to use information about the target in working memory to guide attention and make target-match decisions. The representation of target features is referred to as the \"attentional\" or \"target\" template and is thought to be encoded within an inferior frontal junction (IFJ)-visual attentional network (Baldauf & Desimone, 2014; Bichot et al., 2015). The template typically contains veridical target information that is used to facilitate sensory processing of target during search. However, many behavioral studies have shown that target-associated information (e.g., statistically co-occurring object pairs) is used to guide attention, especially when target discrimination is difficult (Battistoni et al., 2017; de Lange et al., 2018; Peelen et al., 2024; Vo et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2023; Zhou & Geng, 2024). Thus, while target-associated information is known to impact search performance, its presence within the IFJ-visual attentional network during the preparatory period, before search begins, has never been demonstrated. Here, we use fMRI and multivariate pattern analysis to test if attentional guidance by target-associated information is explicitly represented in the preparatory period, either in conjunction with the target or even in place of it. Participants were first trained on four face-scene category pairings after which they completed a cued visual search task for the same faces. Each trial began with a face cue, followed by a delay period, and then a search display with two lateralized faces superimposed on scene images. The critical results showed that while face information could be decoded in the fusiform face area (FFA), superior parietal lobule (SPL), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dLPFC) during the cue period, face information could not be decoded in any brain regions during the delay period. In contrast, the associated scene was decoded only in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vLPFC) during the cue period, but most importantly, in the IFJ and the parahippocampal place area (PPA) during the delay period. Our results are a novel demonstration that target-associated information from memory can supplant the veridical target in the brain's \"target template\" in anticipation of difficult visual search.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

A semi-supervised learning approach was used to train a C. elegans registration network (BrainAlignNet) that aligns pairs of images of the bending C. elegans head with single pixel-level accuracy. When incorporated into an image analysis pipeline, this network can link neurons over time with 99.6% accuracy.

Although neural responses often confer protective benefits, they can also exacerbate inflammation during allergic reactions such as asthma. In our study, we modeled pollution-exacerbated asthma by exposing mice to ambient PM2.5 particles alongside ovalbumin. Compared to exposure to ovalbumin alone, this co-exposure significantly increased the numbers of neutrophils and {gamma}{delta} T cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. We found that silencing nociceptor neurons at the peak of inflammation using intranasal QX-314 or ablating TRPV1-expressing neurons reduced lung neutrophil accumulation. Live in vivo intravital imaging confirmed that neuronal ablation reduced neutrophil numbers and increased their net displacement capacity. In neurons isolated from mice with pollution-exacerbated asthma, the chemical-sensing TRPA1 channel exhibited heightened sensitivity to its cognate ligand. Elevated levels of artemin were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of pollution-exposed mice but returned to baseline in mice with ablated nociceptor neurons. Alveolar macrophages expressing the pollution-sensing aryl hydrocarbon receptor were identified as a putative source of artemin following exposure to PM2.5. This molecule enhanced TRPA1 responsiveness and, in turn, drove nociceptor-mediated neutrophil recruitment, revealing a novel mechanism by which lung-innervating neurons respond to air pollution in the context of allergy.

Emerging evidence suggests that mTORC1 can respond to upstream signals in a nuanced manner, enabling differential regulation of individual substrates and downstream biological processes. However, the nature of signals that determine the signaling selectivity of mTORC1 remains incompletely understood. Here, we studied mTORC1 regulation by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). We found that phosphorylation of the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a non-canonical mTORC1 substrate that controls lysosome biogenesis, responds to GPCRs differently, compared to canonical mTORC1 substrates controlling protein synthesis such as S6K1 and 4EBP1. In particular, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M5 (M5R) promoted phosphorylation of S6K1 and 4EBP1, while triggering TFEB dephosphorylation. Consequently, M5R stimulated protein synthesis without inhibiting lysosome biogenesis. The regulations of an anabolic process and a catabolic process, albeit both governed by mTORC1, are thus decoupled downstream of M5R. This study highlights the importance of reassessing the effects of GPCRs on mTORC1 by concurrently monitoring individual substrates, a critical consideration to be made when evaluating GPCR ligands as therapeutic agents targeting the mTORC1 pathway.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

While the first role can be achieved through unstructured connections tuned for homeostatic rate stabilization, computational tasks often require structured excitatory-inhibitory (E/I) connectivity. Here, we consider a broad class of pairwise inhibitory spike-timing dependent plasticity (iSTDP) rules, demonstrating how inhibitory synapses can self-organize to both stabilize excitation and generate functionally relevant connectivity structures--a process we call \"structured stabilization\". We show that in both E/I circuit motifs and large spiking recurrent neural networks the choice of iSTDP rule can lead to either mutually connected E/I pairs, or to lateral inhibition, where an inhibitory neuron connects to an excitatory neuron that does not directly connect back to it. In a one-dimensional ring network with two inhibitory subpopulations following these distinct iSTDP rules, the effective connectivity among the excitatory units self-organizes into a Mexican-hat-like profile, with excitatory influence in the center and inhibitory influence away from the center. This leads to emergent dynamical properties such as contextual modulation effects and modular spontaneous activity. Our theoretical work introduces a family of rules that retains the broad applicability and simplicity of spike-timing-based plasticity, while promoting structured, self-organized stabilization.

The persisting clinical effects of psychedelics such as psilocybin are commonly attributed to activation of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) based on its role in the acute hallucinatory effects. However, the active metabolite of psilocybin binds to many serotonin receptor subtypes, including the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR). Given the known role of 5-HT1BR in mediating depressive phenotypes and promoting neural plasticity, we hypothesized that it mediates the effects of psilocybin on neural activity and behavior. We first examined the acute neural response to psilocybin in mice lacking 5-HT1BR. We found that 5-HT1BR expression influenced brain-wide activity following psilocybin administration, measured by differences in the patterns of the immediate early gene c-Fos, across regions involved in emotional processing and cognitive function, including the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Functionally, we demonstrated that 5-HT1BR mediates some of the acute and persisting behavioral effects of psilocybin. Although there was no effect of 5-HT1BR expression on the acute head twitch response, mice lacking 5-HT1BRs had attenuated hypolocomotion to psilocybin. We also measured the persisting effects of psilocybin on anhedonia and anxiety-like behavior using transgenic and pharmacological 5-HT1BR loss-of-function models and found that 5-HT1B is involved in mediating the decreased anhedonia and reduced anxiety-like behavior. Finally, using a network analysis, we identified neural circuits through which 5-H1BR may modulate the response to psilocybin.

We use representational similarity analysis to show that optimal transport cost (Wasserstein distance) between pairs of letters aligns with neural activity elicited by visually presented letters <225 ms after stimulus onset, outperforming an existing approach based on shape overlap. We additionally show that optimal transport can capture the emergence of geometric invariances (e.g., to position or size) observed in letter perception. Finally, we demonstrate that Wasserstein distance predicts neural activity similarly well to features from artificial networks trained to classify images and letters. However, whereas representations in artificial neural networks emerge in a computationally unconstrained manner, our proposal provides a computationally explicit route to modeling the earliest orthographic processes.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a clinically important herpesvirus that has co-evolved for millions of years with its human host, and establishes lifelong persistent infection. A substantial proportion of its 235kb genome is dedicated to manipulating host immunity through targeting antiviral host proteins for degradation or relocalisation. Quantitative proteomics of the infected cell has extensively characterised these processes, but the cell-free virion has been less well studied. We therefore carried out proteomic analysis of a clinical HCMV strain virion. This revealed multiple novel components, including the viral protein gpUL141, which is recognised as an NK immune-evasin that targets several host proteins (CD155, CD112, and TRAILR) when expressed in the cell. Co-Immunoprecipitation of gpUL141 from virions identified interactions with viral entry glycoproteins from the trimer (gH/gL/gO), pentamer (gH/gL/UL128/UL130/UL131A), and gH/gpUL116 complexes, as well as gB. These interactions occurred via direct interactions between gpUL141 and either gH or gB. Analysis supported a model in which gpUL141 homodimers independently interacted with separate gB/gH-containing complexes. gpUL141 encodes an ER retention domain that restricts trafficking through the ER/golgi, and limited the transport of glycoprotein complexes bound by gpUL141. As a result, gpUL141 reduced levels of multiple glycoprotein complexes on the infected cell surface as well as in the virion. This reduced syncytia formation, inhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and reduced susceptibility to neutralising antibodies. Thus, gpUL141 represents an immune-evasin that not only targets host proteins to limit NK-cell attack, but also alters the trafficking of multiple viral glycoprotein complexes in order to evade humoral immunity.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Doublecortin proteins bind to microtubules and are thought to stabilise or rigidify microtubules. Upon targeting zyg-8, we observed altered spindle-pole oscillations and perturbations in microtubule cortical-contact behaviour. They could not be explained by changes in microtubule dynamics alone. Instead, the phenotypes were consistent with ZYG-8 contributing to microtubule rigidity. Its depletion or mutation led to more frequent microtubule bending, and higher curvature and tortuosity. Microtubule softening in zyg-8 mutants likely reduced the efficiency of centring forces, causing exaggerated spindle oscillations and subsequent mispositioning during late anaphase. We propose that sufficient microtubule rigidity is essential for generating effective cortical pushing forces, which act as centring mechanisms to ensure accurate spindle orientation during mitosis. These findings may have implications for cancer therapy, since the expression of DCLK1 and Tau, both known regulators of microtubule rigidity, is often deregulated in various human cancers.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

We show that a favorable tether-condensate interaction leads to tether enrichment at the condensate-membrane interface, which reduces the surface tension with the membrane and modifies the equilibrium contact angle. Increasing tether abundance on the membrane can drive transitions between wetting regimes, with only a modest binding energy required for biologically relevant scenarios. Furthermore, by helping condensates coat membranes, mobile tethers can facilitate condensate localization to junctions of membrane structures, such as the reticulated membranes inside the algal pyrenoid.

To address this question, we introduce a method to predict the empirically observed wiring diagram - the connectome - at synaptic resolution based on dense electron-microscopic reconstructions of neural tissue. Our method generates the connectome based on the morphological properties of the neurons in combination with synaptic specificity models, whose parameters capture how neurons wire conditional on their subcellular, cellular and cell type properties. We employ simulation-based Bayesian inference to identify all values for these parameters that can generate the observed connectome. Finally, for each synapse in a dense reconstruction, our method provides quantitative measures to reveal which synaptic specificity models are necessary, sufficient and best-suited to generate it. The output of our method are experimentally testable predictions of wiring preferences from subcellular to cell type levels that could account for each synapse in dense reconstructions. We demonstrate our method on dense datasets from mouse primary visual and human temporal cortex. Strikingly, this demonstration shows that just three assumptions, with nearly the same synaptic specificity values, predict the connectivity in both datasets. Our method is openly accessible as a computational framework that includes a comprehensive workflow for the analysis of wiring specificity, and which provides users with full flexibility to define and test their hypotheses. Our method sets the stage to uncover the principles by which neural networks are organized, and to compare these principles across brain areas, species and time points.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

In yeast, the A/B toxin K28 is internalised to endosomes of susceptible yeast, before following the retrograde trafficking pathway and ultimately triggering cell cycle arrest. The endolysosomal defence factor Ktd1 protects against K28, but its regulation remains unclear. We show all lobe B subunits of the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) tethering complex are required for K28 resistance. Our experiments suggest the hypersensitivity of cog mutants is primarily explained by defects in Ktd1 trafficking. Ktd1 mis-localisation in cog mutants is reminiscent to disruptions in Snc1, a surface cargo that recycles multiple times via the Golgi. This work suggests not only that the COG complex is responsible for the precise trafficking of Ktd1 required to mediate toxin defence, but that Ktd1 may survey endolysosomal compartments for toxin. This work underpins the importance of Ktd1 in defence against the A/B toxin K28, and implies how various membrane trafficking regulators could influence toxin effects in other eukaryotic systems.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

D.; Palmigiano, A.", "abstract": "What are the principles that govern the responses of cortical networks to their inputs and the emergence of these responses from recurrent connectivity? Recent experiments have probed these questions by measuring cortical responses to two-photon optogenetic perturbations of single cells in the mouse primary visual cortex. A robust theoretical framework is needed to determine the implications of these responses for cortical recurrence. Here we propose a novel analytical approach: a formulation of the dependence of cell-type-specific connectivity on spatial distance that yields an exact solution for the linear perturbation response of a model with multiple cell types and space- and feature-dependent connectivity. Importantly and unlike previous approaches, the solution is valid in regimes of strong as well as weak intra-cortical coupling. Analysis reveals the structure of connectivity implied by various features of single-cell perturbation responses, such as the surprisingly narrow spatial radius of nearby excitation beyond which inhibition dominates, the number of transitions between mean excitation and inhibition thereafter, and the dependence of these responses on feature preferences. Comparison of these results to existing optogenetic perturbation data yields constraints on cell-type-specific connection strengths and their tuning dependence. Finally, we provide experimental predictions regarding the response of inhibitory neurons to single-cell perturbations and the modulation of perturbation response by neuronal gain.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

However, the diversity of experimental approaches used has made clear correlations across studies, as well as the significance of the HIV-1 epitranscriptome in biology and disease, difficult to assess. Therefore, we established a reference HIV-1 epitranscriptome. We sequenced the model NL4-3 HIV-1 genome from infected primary CD4+ T cells and the Jurkat cell line using the latest nanopore chemistry, optimized RNA preparation methods, and the most current and readily available base-calling algorithms. A highly reproducible sense and a preliminary antisense HIV-1 epitranscriptome were created, where N6-methyladenosine (m6A), 5-methylcytosine (m5C), pseudouridine (psi), inosine, and 2'-O-methyl (Nm) modifications could be identified by rapid multiplexed base-calling. We observed that sequence and neighboring modification contexts induced modification miscalling, which could be corrected with synthetic HIV-1 RNA fragments. We validated m6A modification sites with STM2457, a small molecule inhibitor of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3). We find that modifications are quite stable under combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) treatment, in primary CD4+ T cells, and in HIV-1 virions. Sequencing samples from people living with HIV (PLWH) revealed conservation of m6A modifications. However, analysis of spliced transcript variants suggests transcript-dependent modification levels.

Zebrafish epiboly, the spreading of the blastoderm to cover and engulf the large yolk cell, is a key early event that sets the stage for the establishment of the body plan, but the way the forces driving expansion are generated and mediated is poorly understood. The enveloping layer (EVL), the thin squamous outer epithelium of the blastoderm, plays a central role. Forces generated in the yolk cell are transmitted through tight junctions to the marginal EVL cells, and then propagate through the rest of the EVL. To understand mechanisms of force generation and transduction during epiboly, we first need a mechanical model of the EVL capable of responding to such forces and undergoing the drastic deformation of epiboly. The expanding EVL more than doubles its surface area and experiences significant shear as it deforms from a thin cap at one pole to become a complete sphere, necessarily requiring extensive internal rearrangement. We constructed an agent-based model of the EVL and its response to exogenous forces using the center-based simulation framework, Tissue Forge. Our model captures the large viscoelastic deformation of the EVL by cell rearrangement, and incorporates algorithmic strategies to accommodate these dynamic changes while maintaining tissue cohesion. Features observed in living embryos, such as the straightening of the initially ragged leading edge, also emerge in the model. We identified two key components required for realistic epiboly in the model: first, a mechanism to enable tissue remodeling by cell rearrangement without tearing the tissue, and second, a negative feedback on the forces driving EVL expansion, to regulate and synchronize the advancement of the EVL margin. We discuss the implications of these findings for the behavior of living EVL and the mechanisms that drive epiboly.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

F-actin probes labeled endocytic patches, contractile actin rings and the Spitzenkorper (SPK), but not exocytic cables generated by the SPK-associated formin, illuminated only by tropomyosin. The SPK actin mesh contains tropomyosin and capping protein, but not fimbrin or Arp2/3, showing that it does not involve branched actin. Arp2/3 and fimbrin are recruited to endocytic patches at the end of their lifecycle, staying in them for 12-14 sec, coinciding with the burst of branched actin polymerization that powers vesicle internalization, whereas verprolin stays only during the first half of this actin phase. Hyphal growth requires endocytic recycling, which we exploited to assess the efficiency of endocytosis following genetic interventions. Ablation of SlaBSla2, Arp2/3, cofilin and fimbrin is lethal, whereas that of Srv2, verprolin and capping protein are debilitating, with the lifetime of actin in mutant patches roughly correlating with the extent of growth and endocytic defects. An outstanding problem is the origin of seed filaments required to prime Arp2/3 during endocytosis. Actin patches associate with cortical cables that give rise to long distance-moving 'actin worms' that are different from tropomyosin-containing cables emanating from the SPK. Cables and worms are dependent on formin, yet inactivation of formin does not affect the F-actin patch lifecycle, arguing against formin playing an endocytic role. Ablation of the WISH/DIP/SPIN90 protein Dip1 priming Arp2/3 for the synthesis of linear actin delocalizes the endocytic machinery and severely impairs, but does not preclude, endocytosis. This establishes the existence of Dip1-independent mechanism(s) that synthesize seed filaments. Our data negate the possibility that this alternative mechanism results from a priming role of formin that is unmasked in dip1{Delta} ; cells, but do not exclude that cofilin-mediated filament severing could produce seed microfilaments for Arp2/3, as suggested for Schizosaccharomyces pombe.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

The molecular mechanisms that maintain this chromosomal structure have not been identified. Here, we describe specific DNA repair pathways that differentiate between hypervariable subtelomeric and conserved core regions of the genome. Based on our previous work, we hypothesized that there are potentially important interactions between translesion (TLS) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways for the diversification of multicopy gene families in P. falciparum. Thus, we created knockout parasite lines of the DNA repair enzymes: PfRad51 and the TLS polymerases PfPol and PfRev1. We identified that irradiation hypersensitivity varied across the cell cycle for TLS{Delta} parasites and was uniform across the erythrocytic cycle for PfRad51{Delta} parasites, highlighting the variable roles of these pathways. However, important interactions between these pathways were found when we studied directed double strand break (DSB) repair, which revealed a difference in the DNA damage response according to chromosomal location. PfRad51 was essential for HR-mediated repair in the core genome.

These findings suggest that mitochondrial ploidy can be used as a sensitive molecular indicator of mutagenic stress, potentially reflecting mitochondrial genome maintenance and organelle adaptation mechanisms.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

D.; Treeck, M.", "abstract": "Fever is a hallmark of malaria. Several studies have linked febrile temperatures to reduced parasite viability, but also to increased cytoadhesion, a key driver of pathology. However, different mechanisms have been proposed to cause changes in cytoadhesion and parasite sensitivity to heat. Here, we demonstrate that exposure of Plasmodium falciparum-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) to physiologically relevant febrile heat stress (39 {degrees}C), derived from patient data, enhances cytoadhesion through increased trafficking of the major virulence factor PfEMP1 to the iRBC surface. This phenomenon is not limited to PfEMP1 and common laboratory strains, as it extends to the surface nutrient channel PSAC in four clinical isolates of diverse geographic origin. The increased surface protein display occurs without changes in overall protein expression or parasite developmental progression. Using phosphoproteomics and proximity labelling, we find that elevated temperature also increases trafficking and phosphorylation of exported proteins into the RBC. Enhanced export is likely reliant on the presence of a transmembrane domain as shown by NanoLuc reporter assays. Collectively, our results indicate that febrile temperatures commonly experienced during infection can accelerate protein export, likely at the parasitophorous vacuole. This enhanced export following heat stress is relevant because increased cytoadhesion could influence disease severity through earlier iRBC sequestration and elevated bound parasite mass.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

This study investigated this question in the context of human spatial navigation by combining high-field fMRI and desktop virtual reality. Participants encoded and retrieved spatial locations using either landmarks alone (landmark condition), visual self-motion cues alone (i.e., optic flow; self-motion condition), or both cues together (combination condition). Participants behaviorally benefited from cue integration. fMRI analyses revealed a cue integration effect in the hippocampus, which displayed positional coding only in the combination condition, and only in participants who showed behavioral benefits from cue integration. Furthermore, hippocampal positional coding was more strongly associated with actual than self-reported locations, indicating it integrates sensory-perceptual inputs from spatial cues. Our findings suggest that the unique function of the hippocampus is to integrate diverse sensory-perceptual inputs to support precise memory-guided navigation, rather than representing space per se, thereby challenging the dominant cognitive map theory in spatial navigation. Our findings may also help unify our understanding of the hippocampal function in spatial navigation and episodic/relational memory.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Upon maturation, core-1, comprising of the 57 residues (39-95) in the N-terminus become structured, resulting in the formation of a non-polymorphic fibril. The truncated FUS-LC-C (residues 110-214) construct forms a fibril in which core-2 (residues 112-150) adopts a {beta}-sheet structure. Using coarse-grained monomer SOP-IDP model simulations of FUS-LC, we predict that residues 155-190 in the C-terminal (core-3) form rapidly, followed by core-2, and finally core-1. The time scale of formation of the cores and their stabilities are inversely correlated, as anticipated by the Ostwald's rule of stages. Unbiased multichain simulations show that the chemical potentials in the two phases are equal and the calculated densities of the dense and dilute phases are in agreement with experiments. The dense phase, which forms by a nucleation mechanism, coarsens over time by a process that is reminiscent of Ostwald ripening. AlphaFold predictions of the core-3 structure and the simulations show tha {beta}-strand emerges in the core-3 region early during the droplet formation, and drives the initiation of FUS-LC assembly. The techniques introduced here are general and could be used to probe assembly of other IDPs such as TDP-43, which shares many features with FUS-LC.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

However, dataset shifts due to variations in the population and acquisition hardware can considerably degrade the model performance. We systematically investigated the generalisation of DL models to unseen datasets with different characteristics, using age as the target variable. Five datasets were used in two different experimental setups, including (1) leave-one-dataset-out (LODO) and (2) leave-one-dataset-in (LODI) cross validation. A comprehensive set of 1805 different hyperparameter configurations was tested, including variations in the DL architectures and data pre-processing. The performance varied across source/target dataset pair. Using LODO, we obtained Pearson's r values of {0.63, 0.84, 0.75, 0.23, 0.10} and R^2 values of {-0.01, 0.63, 0.41, -4.66, -70.98}. For LODI, the results varied in Pearson's r from -0.11 to 0.84 and R^2 values from -704.89 to 0.65, depending on the source and target dataset. Adjusting the model intercepts using the average age of the target dataset substantially improved some R^2 scores. Our results show that DL models can learn age-related EEG patterns which generalise with strong correlations to datasets with broad age spans. The most important hyperparameter was to use the frequency range between 1 and 45Hz, rather than a single frequency band. The second most important hyperparameter effect depended on the experimental setup. Our findings highlight the challenges of dataset shifts in EEG-based DL models and establish a benchmark for future studies aiming to improve the robustness of DL models across diverse datasets.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

A large part of this controversy stems from the lack of phylogenetic consensus for the main branches of the animal tree, where often animals with nervous systems do not form a monophyletic group. However, this question can be informed from other non-phylogenetic perspectives, such as comparative genomics. Here we ask how similar are genes differentially expressed in neurons across a representative set of eight animals with a nervous system and tally the presence or absence of their homologs in 10 other animals and two choanoflagellates. We show that proteins from 39 families are differentially expressed in all neurons, regardless of the phylogenetic placement of their lineage, and that the majority of these gene families are present in the (unicellular) closest relatives of animals, choanoflagellates. We found that the members of these 39 gene families are enriched in domains for ion transport and juxtacrine signalling, and that there is one gene family of zinc-dependent extracellular matrix-remodelling proteins which is only found in animals bearing a nervous system. Our results show that common genetic toolkits are in place for the function of nervous systems. We identify a large number of potential new genomic markers linked to the nervous system and hope they can complement ongoing research efforts to better understand this quintessentially animal system.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Some demand fast learning rates, while others benefit from using slower ones. To adjust learning rates, people could rely on either global, meta-learned differences between environments, or faster but transient adaptations to locally experienced prediction errors. Here, we introduce a new paradigm that allows researchers to measure and empirically disentangle both forms of adaptations. Participants performed short blocks of trials of a continuous estimation task (fishing for crabs) on six different islands that required different optimal (initial) learning rates. Across two experiments, participants showed fast adaptations in learning rate within a block. Critically, participants also learned global environment-specific learning rates over the time course of the experiment, as evidenced by computational modelling and by the learning rates calculated on the very first trial when revisiting an environment (i.e., unconfounded by transient adaptations). Using representational similarity analyses of fMRI data, we found that differences in voxel pattern responses in the central orbitofrontal cortex correlated with differences in these global environment-specific learning rates. Our findings show that humans adapt learning rates at both slow and fast time scales, and that the central orbitofrontal cortex may support meta-learning by representing environment-specific task-relevant features such as learning rates.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

We recently discovered new orthoflavivirus-directed bnAbs, including F25.S02, which neutralizes DenV1-4 and ZikV with comparable or superior potency to the previously characterized E dimer epitope (EDE) bnAbs. Mutagenesis studies of viral envelope proteins showed that the epitope specificity of F25.S02 is distinct from EDE1 bnAbs. Here, we used cryoEM and X-ray crystallography to understand the basis of cross-neutralization of F25.S02 at the molecular level. We obtained a ~4.2 [A] cryoEM structure of F25.S02 Fab bound to a stabilized DenV3 soluble E protein dimer and a 2.3 [A] crystal structure of F25.S02 Fab bound to ZikV soluble E protein dimer. Like previously described EDE1 bnAbs, the structural epitope of F25.S02 is at the E dimer interface, encompassing predominantly conserved regions in domain II, including the fusion loop. However, unlike EDE1 bnAbs, F25.S02 binding is almost entirely dependent on the heavy chain and is shifted slightly away from the dimer symmetry axis.

However, limitations on parameter estimation have prevented their use with individual, high-resolution human neuroimaging data. Furthermore, most studies focus only on connectivity, ignoring node heterogeneity, even though real brain regions have different structural and dynamical properties. Here we present an improved approach to fitting Ising models to 360-region functional MRI data: derivation of an initial guess model from group data, optimization of simulation temperature, and two stages of Boltzmann learning, first with group data, then with individual data. We then analyze how data binarization threshold affects goodness-of-fit, the role of the external field in model behavior, and correlations between model parameters and features from structural MRI, including myelination and sulcus depth. The fitted models can reproduce the functional connectivity of the data across a wide range of thresholds, but the role of the external field parameters in model behavior increases with threshold. In parallel, the coupling between nodes correlates with structural connectivity throughout this range, but correlations between the external field and structural features increase with threshold. These results show how our methodology enables personalized, biophysically interpretable modeling of structure-function relationships at the whole-brain level, which can aid understanding of individual differences in brain network organization and dynamics.

C.; Garcia, M. E.; Stengl, M.", "abstract": "The mating behavior of nocturnal Manduca sexta hawkmoths is under strict temporal control. It is orchestrated via circadian- and ultradian oscillations in sex-pheromone stimuli as social zeitgeber. The extremely sensitive pheromone-detecting olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that innervate the long trichoid sensilla on the males antennae are peripheral circadian clocks. They express the transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) circadian clockwork, best characterized in Drosophila melanogaster. In hawkmoths, it is still unknown whether or how the ORNs TTFL clockwork regulates the daily rhythms in pheromone-sensitivity and in temporal resolution of ultradian pheromone pulses as prerequisites to the temporal regulation of hawkmoth mating behavior.\n\nWe hypothesize that, rather than the slow TTFL clock, a more rapidly adaptive post- translational feedback loop (PTFL) clockwork, associated with the ORNs plasma membrane, allows for temporal control of pheromone detection via generation of multiscale endogenous membrane potential oscillations. The potential oscillations of the PTFL clock could rapidly synchronize to oscillations of pheromone stimuli at different timescales, thus enable the prediction of stimulus patterns as a mechanism for active sensing. With in vivo long-term tip recordings of long trichoid sensilla of male hawkmoths, we analyzed the spontaneous spiking activity indicative of the ORNs endogenous membrane potential oscillations. Consistent with our hypothesis of a multiscale PTFL clock in hawkmoth ORNs, spontaneous spiking was modulated on ultradian and circadian timescales, with maximum activity at night. When we blocked the evolutionarily conserved olfactory receptor coreceptor (Orco), the circadian modulation was abolished but the ultradian frequency modulation of the spontaneous activity remained. Consistent with PTFL control, Orco was not under the circadian control of the TTFL clock. We could replicate the experimental data in a conductance-based computational model of Orco. In this model, Orco conductivity changed as a function of fluctuating 2nd messenger levels. This study demonstrates that a PTFL is sufficient to impose a circadian pattern on ORN sensitivity.\n\nSignificance statementIt is generally assumed that all circadian rhythms in an organism are driven by a transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) clock. In this study, we demonstrate with in vivo recordings of hawkmoth pheromone-sensitive olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) that the olfactory receptor coreceptor (Orco) is the key pacemaker channel for controlling circadian but not ultradian rhythms in spontaneous spiking activity. Since Orco expression is not driven by the TTFL clock, its conductance is rather controlled by a post-translational feedback loop (PTFL) membrane clock. Accordingly, our computational model suggests that periodic changes in the conductivity of an Orco ion channel, which is mediated by cycling levels of cyclic nucleotides, tune ORN sensitivity. This highlights the role of the contribution of posttranslational modifications to the generation of circadian rhythmicity.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

In estradiol (E2)-treated cells, H3K27ac modified chromatin adopts open, elongated structures associated with active enhancers, while ER inhibition induces compact, spherical H3K27ac modified chromatin conformations linked to repression. A constitutively active ER mutation linked to endocrine therapy resistance in breast cancer maintains open chromatin states independent of ligand, suggesting sustained transcriptional activity. Our findings provide the first direct visualization of H3K27ac associated chromatin structural dynamics, challenging the assumption that H3K27ac modification alone is sufficient to lead to enhancer activation. By demonstrating that H3K27ac architecture is dynamically regulated by ER, we establish a new paradigm for understanding epigenetic regulation and highlight potential therapeutic targets for endocrine therapy resistant cancers.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Yet, the molecular mechanisms through which juvenile environments shape adult physiology and behavior via transstadial effects remain largely unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that larval competition, a key ecological stressor, profoundly alters adult body size, survival, reproductive output, host-seeking behavior, olfactory neurophysiology, and vector competence in the mosquito Aedes aegypti. Crucially, using transcriptomic profiling and integrative network analyses, we identify seven regulatory hub genes whose expression is strongly associated with size-dependent variation in olfactory behavior, reproductive investment, and Zika virus transmission potential. These hub genes belong to gene modules enriched for functions in chemosensory processing, metabolic regulation, and signal transduction, revealing a molecular framework mediating environmentally induced plasticity across metamorphosis. Integrating these empirical findings into a transmission model, we show that incomplete larval control can inadvertently increase outbreak risk by producing larger, longer-lived, and more competent vectors. Our results uncover molecular mechanisms underpinning phenotypic plasticity in disease vectors and highlight the critical need to account for transstadial effects in models of vector-borne disease transmission.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Flux balance analysis revealed that current probiotic species fail to capture the metabolic diversity of native commensals. Focusing on vaginal health, we identified commensals with metabolic profiles overlapping Gardnerella vaginalis, a key pathobiont. In vitro spent media assays using 11 vaginal isolates showed variable inhibition of G. vaginalis, primarily driven by D-lactic acid production rather than metabolic similarity. Several non-Lactobacillus species produced inhibitory levels of D-lactate.

Segregating this cohort based on status of treatment with approved antifibrotics (untreated, nintedanib- and pirfenidone-treated), we describe for the first time the transcriptional landscape of untreated IPF across 40 lung cell types, and the elements of this program that are impacted by approved antifibrotics. On average, 60% of the untreated IPF-dysregulated transcriptome is refractory to treatment with these drugs, a transcriptional deficit we refer to as the IPF therapeutic gap. Regulatory network analysis indicated a dominant functional footprint for the transcription factor STAT3 in both untreated IPF and in the IPF therapeutic gap. Validating our analysis in a translational precision cut lung slice platform that recapitulates IPF explants, treatment with a STAT3 inhibitor reduced the IPF therapeutic gap in numerous lung cell types. Finally, we implicated STAT3 as a master transcription factor that regulates a network comprising numerous profibrotic transcription factors in IPF alveolar fibroblasts, a critical fibrotic cell lineage.

Range-wide surveys of the butterfly and its associated habitat demonstrated that the butterfly's sole host plant is decreasing in abundance at lower elevations, likely due to increased salinization. We also find declines in butterfly population size over an eleven-year period using distance sampling. Despite these declines, we find that Klot's sawgrass skipper's range has not contracted significantly over the study period. This study demonstrates that monitoring a single taxon and its host is useful for understanding how sea level rise impacts a keystone plant species in freshwater wetlands which are vital for the continued survival of a suite of rare and endemic species found in the Florida Keys. Projections of near-future sea level rise indicate that most or all of this habitat will be lost within several decades; the continued study of low-lying islands is critical to gain insight into the global phenomenon of sea level rise.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

We conducted a controlled trial implementing a 5-day biofeedback-guided interoceptive training program to assess its impact on interoceptive accuracy (IAc) and psychological dimensions of bodily and mental perception. The experimental group showed significant improvements in IAc compared to controls, reflecting enhanced detection of heartbeats. Training increased scores on two MAIA subscales: Awareness of Negative Emotional States and Not Distracting. These outcomes suggest the intervention enhanced the capacity of participants to acknowledge and engage with unpleasant bodily sensations without resorting to avoidance or distraction strategies. A trend toward improved body image perception emerged in the experimental group, with gains correlating with reductions in depressive symptoms, underscoring the interplay between bodily awareness and emotional well-being. These findings underscore that targeted interoceptive training represents a powerful tool for refining awareness of internal states, enhancing attentional control, and optimizing emotional processing.

These MNDs were selected for their unique ability to exert magnetic torque due to vortex magnetization, and their intrinsic magnetostrictive behaviour. The resulting ME fibers preserve the piezoelectric beta-phase of PVDF and exhibit magnetoelectric voltage coefficient of 1.26V/cm/Oe. We compare two magnetic activation strategies; torque-based and high-frequency magnetostriction, finding that magnetostriction more effectively triggers neuronal responses. In vitro calcium imaging reveals robust activation in primary cortical neurons cultured on ME fibers.

TE-Dependent ANAlysis (tedana) is an open-source software tailored to denoising of multi-echo fMRI data. The efficacy of denoising can however be inconsistent, often necessitating manual inspection that precludes its application in large-scale studies where processing is ideally fully automated. Here, we introduce Robust-tedana, an optimised denoising pipeline that achieves adequate results at both single-subject and group level. Robust-tedana incorporates Marchenko-Pastur Principal Component Analysis (MPPCA) for effective thermal noise reduction, robust independent component analysis for stabilised signal decomposition, and a modified component classification process. We evaluated its performance on Multi-Band Multi-Echo (MBME) language-task fMRI data from the Australian Epilepsy Project (AEP) using objective measures, comparing to conventional fMRI analysis with and without multi-echo-based denoising. Experts' manual evaluation was undertaken on a subset of these data to validate the objective measures. The proposed pipeline both mitigates the prevalence of erroneous attenuation of genuine task activation due to instability of single-subject analysis, and increases the magnitude of group-wise effects. Robust-tedana therefore facilitates advanced analysis of MBME fMRI data in an automated pipeline, including for clinical research assessment of individuals.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

I.; Ricciardi, E.", "abstract": "Innate cortical organisation and postnatal sensory experience interact dynamically to shape the functional architecture of the human brain. Using naturalistic stimulation, functional gradient analyses, and comparative approaches in congenitally blind, congenitally deaf, and typically developed individuals, we investigated how intrinsic hierarchical structures and sensory experiences influence cortical organisation. Our findings demonstrate that the principal functional gradients spanning from unimodal sensory to transmodal association cortices are consistently preserved across all groups, suggesting a robust genetically determined cortical scaffold. Nonetheless, congenital sensory deprivation selectively reshapes the geometry of modality-specific gradients, characterised by reduced functional differentiation within sensory-deprived cortical regions. These geometric contractions promote experience-driven plastic reorganization, enabling deprived sensory areas to establish enhanced functional connectivity with transmodal and non-deprived sensory cortices. Critically, this reorganisation aligns systematically with pre-existing cortical gradients, highlighting intrinsic hierarchical constraints that guide experience-dependent plasticity. Moreover, sensory-deprived regions exhibiting heightened connectivity actively engage in processing structured perceptual information from intact modalities, reflecting specific feature-driven cross-modal adaptations. Collectively, these results underscore a fundamental duality in cortical organisation: innate hierarchical principles impose constraints on cortical architecture, while sensory experience drives adaptive refinement, demonstrating the brain's intrinsic capacity for flexible functional reconfiguration in response to sensory deprivation.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Previous work reported the emergence of ripples at P10 in the CA1 region, together with the development of inhibition. On the other hand, neither the relationships between perisomatic inhibition and ripples or their developmental emergence have been investigated in CA3, in which ripples have a different frequency profile (90-110Hz instead of 140-200Hz in CA1), functional perisomatic inhibitory circuits have different properties, and some developmental aspects such as neurogenesis or interneuron maturation are early compared to CA1. We have here investigated the hypothesis of a conjoint and earlier appearance and maturation of ripples and perisomatic inhibition in the CA3 hippocampal region compared to CA1. We report a parallel sequence of events in CA3 and CA1, starting with the early expression of perisomatic GABAergic synaptic activity combined with the emergence of ripple activity. Interestingly, perisomatic inhibition and ripple activity follow parallel maturation trajectories, beginning in CA3 at P7 with immature (i.e. unfunctional) inhibition and immature ripples (proto-ripples) with labile oscillatory frequency. Mature functional perisomatic inhibition and clear high-frequency ripple activity progressively emerge between P10 and P12, reaching adult-like properties by P13. A similarly progressive maturation of ripples occurs in CA1, from P11 to P15. The progressive emergence of functional inhibition and specific patterns of neuronal activity likely support the progressive emergence of cognitive function to which they are necessary prerequisite.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

B.; Acharya, S.; Murray, H. C.; Schjenken, J. E.; Pennell, C. E.; Smith, R.", "abstract": "Background: Mitochondria are organelles required for bioenergetic homeostasis, providing energy in the form of ATP to support cellular function, growth, and proliferation. Mitochondria synthesise ATP using the electron transport chain (ETC) to produce an electrochemical gradient that facilitates the conversion of ADP to ATP by ATP synthase. Mitochondrial function is governed by an intricate bidirectional relationship between the mitochondrial genome encoding 1-2% of proteins and the nuclear genome which encodes 98-99% of mitochondrial proteins. Pregnancy creates a unique environment whereby the mitochondrial genome of the placenta is maternally inherited, while the nuclear genome is comprised of both maternal and paternal contributions. Thus, mitochondrial structure and function are largely dependent on the adaptability of mitochondria to conform to the new mixed nuclear genome. In pregnancy, fetal growth restriction (FGR) is characterised by poor placental development, underlying trophoblast insufficiencies, and is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction within the placenta, although the mechanisms which underpin these changes remain unclear. This study investigated if mitochondrial dysfunction in FGR is programmed by genetic incompatibility arising from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Methods and findings: We performed a targeted meta-analysis of over 100 genome wide association studies within the early growth genetics (EGG) consortium, assessing 289 genes encoding mitochondrial function across the ETC and ATP synthase. This study identified 37 SNPs across 32 genes associated with low birthweight. Sanger sequencing was performed to validate the presence of 10 SNPs of interest located within the nuclear genome in a cohort of fetal growth restricted placentas. Of the 10 SNPs assessed we confirmed the presence of 6 in FGR, and identified an additional previously unidentified SNP, and detected 3 nucleotide deletions across numerous components of the electron transport chain. This analysis identified 5 mutations within genes that encode complex I. Subsequent analysis of the gene and proteins that correspond to complex I mutations was performed using PCR, proteomics, and western blotting. Notably, we identified significant downregulation of NDUFA6 at the gene and protein level in FGR, lower protein levels of NDUFS3 and NDUFS6, and confirmed the largest log2fold change identified in NDUFS6 by western blot. Subsequent investigation of mitochondrial respiratory capacity identified decreased ATP-linked respiration in FGR using Seahorse XF Analysis. Conclusion: Our results identify that there is an inheritable contribution of SNPs within the maternal and paternal nuclear genome in fetal growth restriction. These SNPs alter gene expression and protein abundance of mitochondrial complex I components, impacting structural assembly and subsequent bioenergetic function within the placenta. Collectively these findings suggest that SNPs that affect mitochondrial assembly and function are associated with low birthweight and fetal growth restriction.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

However, the constraints of non-invasive sampling pose serious challenges to the acquisition of physiological data from most species of primates. As a result, little is known about how the gut responds to ecological stimuli at the cellular level in wild populations. Recent research has demonstrated that proteomics could fill this knowledge gap by sequencing and quantifying proteins directly from primate feces. In order to ascertain how the gut of free-ranging white-faced capuchin monkeys (C. imitator) is influenced by environmental heterogeneity, diet, age, and sex, we sequenced 45 fecal proteomes from 24 individuals from the Sector Santa Rosa population in Costa Rica, using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with label-free quantification.

The mechanism by which ectopic gene activation occurs through these gain-of-function enhancer mutations remains poorly understood. Using the ZRS, a benchmark disease-associated enhancer of Sonic hedgehog (Shh), as a model, we demonstrate that poised (i.e., accessible but inactive) chromatin sensitizes Shh to aberrant activation in anterior limb bud, leading to polydactyly. In the anterior limb cells of wild-type mice, Shh is inactive, but the ZRS is accessible and marked by enhancer-associated histone modifications. We demonstrate that this poising signature explains how over 20 independent rare variants within the ZRS cause Shh misexpression in the same anterior limb bud cell population, resulting in similar limb malformations, despite affecting binding sites for different activators and repressors. Disabling pioneer transcription factor binding to the ZRS suppresses its poised state in anterior cells, prevents aberrant activation of the ZRS by rare variants, and fully rescues limb malformations in variant knock-in mice. A thorough examination of other disease-associated enhancers with pathogenic gain-of-function variants revealed that they are all poised in tissues with ectopic activity. We use this poising signature to predict and validate in vivo ectopic forebrain activity of previously uncharacterized autism-associated non-coding variants. Our findings suggest that spatial enhancer poising, likely a byproduct of development, creates a susceptibility to non-coding mutations and offers a potential mechanistic explanation for the burden of disease-associated non-coding variants.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Comparing ESMFold and OmegaFold, ESMFold achieves higher confidence scores (pLDDT) and structural similarity (TM-score).

We performed mechanical indentation measurements on intact granules as well as nanoindentation measurements on thin sections. We employed advanced imaging to correlate the internal structure and spatial organization of granules with quantitative measurements of their multiscale mechanical properties. We found that pink berries behave like soft ({approx}1 kPa), strain-rate dependent materials with fast relaxation times ({approx}1 s), indicating rapid transport of fluids with nutrients and other substances through the granule. Additionally, microscale mechanical measurements revealed individual contributions from the cell microcolonies and the extracellular matrix of the composite, summing to the observed macroscopic mechanical properties by applying the rule of mixtures based on structural composition obtained from imaging with fluorescence light sheet microscopy ({approx}34% cell microcolonies).

Although the approach based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is widely used, it is computationally expensive. Alternatively, machine learning can predict membrane permeability at negligible cost, but it requires a larger dataset. There are only 7991 experimental values of membrane permeability available at the newly developed database. Another challenge in predicting membrane permeability using machine learning arises from the unique stable conformation of each cyclic peptide, which is strongly related to membrane permeability but difficult to predict from chemical structure. Therefore, we developed a machine learning protocol using 3D descriptors obtained from MD simulations in addition to 2D descriptors obtained from chemical structure of cyclic peptides, respectively, to generate a universal model with a realistic computational cost. We targeted 252 peptides across four datasets and, to calculate their 3D descriptors, predicted their conformation outside the membrane, at the water/membrane interface, and in the membrane by MD simulations based on the replica exchange with solute tempering/replica exchange umbrella sampling method using 16 replicas. For machine learning, six different algorithms were used, ranging from simple methods such as ridge regression to more sophisticated methods such as XGBoost. The best prediction performance was obtained using XGBoost, with a Pearson's correlation coefficient R = 0.77 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.62. The important descriptors included those that describe the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of the peptide, conformational differences between inside and outside the membrane, and the degree of freedom of the peptide. We confirm the model's ability to predict the membrane permeability of peptides that differ in chemical structure from the training data by predicting the external data consisting of 24 peptides and obtained R = 0.76, RMSE = 1.14. Furthermore, we extracted one of the four datasets of the training data, re-trained the model, and performed the prediction of the permeability coefficients of the extracted dataset. The results showed the model's generic nature with R = 0.61 and RMSE = 0.74, when using position-specific (PS) 3D, and 2D descriptors. In such situations descriptors based on conformations obtained from MD are essential for the prediction.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

M.; Alvarado, J.; Belardi, B.; Rangamani, P.; Stachowiak, J. C.; Rangamani, P.", "abstract": "Protein condensates use multivalent binding and surface tension to assemble actin filaments into diverse architectures, reminiscent of filopodia and stress fibers. During this process, nucleation of new filaments and elongation of existing filaments inherently compete for a shared pool of actin monomers. Here we show that a balance between these competing processes is required to deform condensates of VASP, an actin binding protein, into structures with high aspect ratios. Addition of magnesium, which promotes filament nucleation, helped actin to deform condensates into high aspect ratio structures. In contrast, addition of profilin, which inhibits filament nucleation, allowing existing filaments to elongate, caused actin to assemble into ring-like bundles that failed to substantially increase condensate aspect ratio. Computational modeling helped to explain these results by predicting that a group of short linear filaments, which can apply asymmetric pressure to the condensate boundary, is needed to increase condensate aspect ratio. In contrast, a small number of long filaments with the same total actin content should fail to overcome the droplet surface tension, forming a ring-like bundle. To test these predictions, we introduced gelsolin, which severed log filaments within rings, creating new barbed ends. The resulting set of shorter filaments regained the ability to deform condensates into high aspect ratio structures. Collectively, these results suggest that a balance of actin filament nucleation and elongation is required to deform protein condensates. More broadly, these findings illustrate how protein condensates can balance multiple kinetic processes to direct the assembly of diverse cytoskeletal architectures.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Ng has long been recognized as a dedicated calmodulin (CaM)-binding/buffering protein. This study demonstrates that Ng, through its CaM-binding IQ domain, directly binds the distal C-terminus (DCT) of the L-type Ca2+ (CaV1) channel, as a de novo mechanism regulating excitation-transcription coupling. The Ng/DCT interaction attenuates autonomous C-terminus-mediated inhibition and promotes specific CaM delivery to CaV1, cooperatively enhancing channel gating (activation and inactivation), Ca2+ influx and downstream neuronal signaling. Phosphorylation of Ng leads to the dissociation of the CaM C-lobe, while transiently forming the linkage with the CaM N-lobe. In contrast to neurodegenerative disease-related Ng mutants, WT Ng, within the above transient complex, enables the targeted CaM transfer to the proximal C-terminus of CaV1. Collective evidence from electrophysiology, binding assays, structural modeling and Ca2+ imaging supports a paradigm of dynamic intra- and inter-molecular interactions/facilitations underlying Ng and CaV1, both of which are representative CaM-binding proteins.

Since many nearly transparent cells in marine environments have complex, often non-axisymmetric shapes, this observation raises fundamental, yet little-explored questions in biological optics about light refraction by the bodies of microorganisms. There are two distinct contexts for such questions: the absorption problem for incoming light, typified by photosynthetic activity taking place in the chloroplasts of green algae, and the emission problem for outgoing light, where the paradigm is bioluminescence emitted from scintillons within dinoflagellates. Here we examine both of these aspects of ``algal optics\" in the special case where the absorption or emission is localized in structures that are small relative to the overall organism size, taking into account both refraction and reflections at the cell-water boundary. Analytical and numerical results are developed for the distribution of light intensities inside and outside the body, and we establish certain duality relationships that connect the incoming and outgoing problems.

Previously suggested determinants of rheology did not account for this variation; instead, we found a strong anticorrelation between the diffusion coefficient and the abundance of amino acid metabolism proteins, persisting upon genetic perturbations and showing that lower diffusion is associated with increased viscoelasticity. Photoactivated light microscopy revealed that some amino acid metabolism proteins form clusters.

Interfacial tension is a key determinant of biomolecular condensate behavior, influencing condensate size and interactions with intracellular structures. Certain proteins and RNAs are known to selectively localize to the interface of condensates, where they can regulate condensate function in cells. Previously, we designed amphiphilic proteins that preferentially adsorb to the surface of condensates. These proteins contain one phase-separating domain (RGG) and one non-phase-separating domain (MBP or GST). Here, we demonstrate through direct quantification that these amphiphilic proteins act as surfactants, reducing the interfacial tension of RGG-RGG condensates from ~260 N/m to ~100 N/m in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, the GST-based surfactant protein exhibits a 10-fold greater efficacy in lowering interfacial tension compared to the MBP-based surfactant. We show that this increased efficacy is due to its higher surface density, driven by GST's ability to oligomerize. We also show that these surfactant proteins slow droplet fusion and reduce average droplet size, as would be expected of a typical surfactant.

Tasks like speech and locomotion, however, require the integration of voluntary commands with ongoing movements orchestrated by largely independent subcortical centers. In such cases, motor cortex must receive inputs representing the state of the environment and the state of subcortical networks, then transform these inputs into commands that modulate the rhythmic motor pattern. Here, we study this transformation in mice performing an obstacle traversal task, which combines a spinal locomotor pattern with voluntary cortical adjustments. Cortical dynamics contain a prominent representation of motor preparation that is linked to obstacle proximity and robust to removal of somatosensory or visual input, and also maintain a representation of the state of the spinal pattern generator. Readout signals resembling commands for obstacle traversal are consistent across trials, but small in amplitude. Using computational modeling, we identify a simple algorithm that generates the appropriate commands through phase-dependent gating.

In order to accelerate enhancer discovery for the dorsal spinal cord, a region critical for pain and itch processing, we developed an end-to-end platform, ESCargoT (Engineered Specificity of Cargo Transcription), combining machine learning (ML) guided enhancer prioritization, modular AAV assembly, and multiplexed, in situ screening.

These small, densely connected modules are often nested within larger, higher-order modules, giving rise to a hierarchical modular architecture. This structure is posited to balance information segregation in specialized neuronal communities and global integration via intermodular communication. Yet, how hierarchical modularity shapes network function remains unclear. Here we introduce a simple blockmodeling framework for generating and comparing multi-level hierarchical modular networks and implement them as recurrent neural network reservoirs to evaluate their computational capacity. We show that hierarchical modular networks enhance memory capacity, support multitasking, and give rise to a broader range of temporal dynamics compared to strictly modular and random networks. These functional advantages can be traced to topological features enriched in hierarchical modular networks, which include reciprocal and cyclic network motifs. To test whether the computational advantages of hierarchical modularity subsist in empirical human brain structural connectivity patterns, we develop a novel hierarchical modularity-preserving network null model, allowing us to isolate the positive effect of empirical hierarchical modularity patterns on memory capacity. To evaluate the biomimetic validity of connectome-informed reservoir dynamics, we compare reservoir timescales to empirical brain timescales derived from MEG data and find that hierarchical modularity contributes to shaping brain-like neural timescales.

Smoking during pregnancy was associated with smaller hypothalamus volume in newborns (t=-2.05, p=0.04; dose dependence: t=-2.9, p<0.01).

While it is evident that motor abilities deteriorate with age, it is incorrect to assume that all aspects of movement execution are equally affected. The cerebellum, a brain region that is closely involved in motor control among other functions, undergoes clear structural changes with aging. While several studies suggest that cerebellar degeneration causes age related motor control deficits, other studies suggest that the cerebellum might act as a motor reserve and compensate for its structural degeneration, leaving cerebellar motor function intact despite cerebellar degeneration. The present study aims at thoroughly investigating the impact of age on cerebellar function across an array of tasks and domains. We investigated cerebellar motor and cognitive functions across the lifespan by examining 50 young adults (20 to 35 years), 80 older adults (55 to 70 years), and 30 older old adults (over 80 years). Participants completed a test battery comprising seven motor control tasks and one cognitive task, each designed to probe cerebellar function through different paradigms. This multi task approach allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of performance patterns, providing a balanced perspective on cerebellar function across the different age groups. In addition, we analyzed outcomes from the same tasks that, while related to movement, were not specifically linked to cerebellar function. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was also conducted to assess whether cerebellar atrophy was present in the older and older old groups compared to the young. Our results revealed that, despite age-related cerebellar degeneration, cerebellar functions in older adults remained intact compared to young adults, even in adults above 80 years old. In contrast, the sensorimotor measures that were not directly linked to cerebellar function exhibited a clear pattern of decline in older adults, and were further deteriorated in the older-old adults compared to the older adults. These findings indicate that cerebellar motor control functions remain largely preserved with age, providing compelling evidence that the cerebellum possesses a remarkable degree of functional resilience and redundancy. This suggests that cerebellar circuits may be uniquely equipped to preserve function despite structural degeneration.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

B.; Yassine, T.; Mehta, V.; Denomme, N.; Zhang, Z.; Malenka, R. C.; Eshel, N.", "abstract": "Effort is costly: given a choice, we tend to avoid it. But in many cases, effort adds value to the ensuing rewards. From ants to humans, individuals prefer rewards that had been harder to achieve. This counterintuitive process may promote reward-seeking even in resource-poor environments, thus enhancing evolutionary fitness. Despite its ubiquity, the neural mechanisms supporting this behavioral effect are poorly understood. Here we show that effort amplifies the dopamine response to an otherwise identical reward, and this amplification depends on local modulation of dopamine axons by acetylcholine. High-effort rewards evoke rapid acetylcholine release from local interneurons in the nucleus accumbens. Acetylcholine then binds to nicotinic receptors on dopamine axon terminals to augment dopamine release when reward is delivered. Blocking the cholinergic modulation blunts dopamine release selectively in high-effort contexts, impairing effortful behavior while leaving low-effort reward consumption intact. These results reconcile in vitro studies, which have long demonstrated that acetylcholine can trigger dopamine release directly through dopamine axons; with in vivo studies that failed to observe such modulation, but did not examine high-effort contexts. Our findings uncover a mechanism that drives effortful behavior through context-dependent local interactions between acetylcholine and dopamine axons.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

E.; Zhang, K.; Hartmann, M. J.", "abstract": "Animal nervous systems must coordinate the sequence and timing of numerous muscles - a challenging control problem. The challenge is particularly acute for highly mobile sensing structures with many degrees of freedom, such as eyes, pinnae, hands, forepaws, and whiskers, because these low-mass, distal sensors require complex muscle coordination. This work examines how the geometry of the rat whisker array simplifies coordination required for \"whisking\" behavior [1-3]. During whisking, 33 intrinsic (\"sling\") muscles are the primary drivers [4-12] of the rapid, rhythmic protractions of the large mystacial vibrissae (whiskers), which vary more than sixfold in length and threefold in base diameter [13-16]. Although whisking is a rhythmic, centrally-patterned behavior [17-24], rodents can change the position, shape, and size of the whisker array, indicating considerable voluntary control [25-34]. To begin quantifying how the array's biomechanics contribute to whisking movements, we used three-dimensional anatomical reconstructions of follicle and sling muscle geometry to simulate the movement resulting from a \"uniform motor command,\" defined as equal firing rates across all sling muscle motor neurons. This simulation provides a baseline profile of protraction under anatomically realistic but uniformly driven conditions. It does not isolate neural from biomechanical contributions but helps identify deviations that suggest active control. Simulations reveal that all follicles rotate through approximately equal angles, regardless of size. The angular fanning of the whiskers at their bases increases monotonically throughout protraction, while maximum distance between whisker tips occurs at approximately 90% of resting muscle length, after which whisker tips converge and sensing resolution increases monotonically.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

The HSV-1 protein ICP4 caused fluidization and enabled growth of synthetic nuclear condensates. Conversely, conditions that decreased nuclear fluidity inhibited the formation of viral replication compartment condensates and reduced infectious virus production.

P.", "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis type II, also known as Hunter syndrome, is a rare and fatal disease caused by mutations in the iduronate 2-sulfatase (IDS) encoding gene. The enzymatically inactive variant proteins lead to pathological accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the lysosomes, causing dysfunction in multiple organs. IDS is expressed as a precursor protein, and its processing and lysosomal targeting are crucial for proper enzymatic activity. However, IDS intracellular dynamic is poorly understood and a better understanding of its processing mechanisms would benefit the development of new therapeutic strategies. AlphaFold 3 predicted an interaction between IDS and the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF13. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirm this interaction and further show that RNF13 interacts preferentially with a predominantly underglycosylated immature form of IDS, resulting in altered IDS glycosylation and maturation. The results demonstrate that IDS glycosylation site Asn246 is important for lysosomal targeting, although its glycosylation is not altered by RNF13. This study also unravels that RNF13 forms a heterodimer with the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF167 that modify both RNF13 and RNF167 lysosomal trafficking. In addition, the heterodimer interacts and alters IDS differently than RNF13 or RNF167 alone. RNF13 catalytic E3 ligase activity is required to generate an underglycosylated form, but not that of RNF167. This study exposes that the proteasome rapidly degrades IDS underglycosylated forms, and RNF13 exerts a protective effect. Overall, this study reveals a novel and dual role of RNF13 on IDS maturation and degradation, providing mechanistic insights into IDS trafficking.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, the SFXN1 paralogues SFXN2 and SFXN3 partially complement loss of SFXN1 to enable glycine transport, while SFXN2 and SFXN5 partially complement loss of SFXN1 to enable GABA transport.

We identified Twinfilin-1 (Twf1) as a downstream effector of reelin signaling via phosphoproteomic analysis, based on its reduced tyrosine phosphorylation in reeler mice. We found that Src regulated Twf1 phosphorylation at tyrosine 309, and reelin stimulation increased Twf1 phosphorylation in neurons, an effect blocked by the Src inhibitor PP2.

Thalamostriatal disruption is attributed to hyperactivity of striatal cholinergic interneurons (CHIs), which is associated with enhanced Trpc3 and Pex51 (Trip8b) gene expression. Elevated acetylcholine levels in the DMS act on presynaptic M2 muscarinic receptors to weaken Pf-DMS glutamatergic transmission. Importantly, disruption of Pf-DMS synaptic transmission or hyperactivation of CHIs are each sufficient to cause amotivation in wild-type mice.

The joint organization of visual-selective, auditory-selective, tactile-selective, and supramodal WM recruitment within individual subjects has not been fully investigated previously. Male and female human subjects participated in a blocked fMRI task requiring them to perform N-back WM judgements in auditory, visual, or tactile (haptic) modalities.

We also observed several bilateral tactile-selective regions abutting previously described visual- and auditory-selective regions, including dorsal and ventral precentral sulcus, the postcentral sulcus, and the anterior intraparietal sulcus. Several cortical regions were recruited by WM in all three sensory modalities in individual subjects, including precentral sulcus, inferior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula and pre-supplementary motor area. Supramodal regions exhibited substantial overlap with visual-biased regions in frontal and parietal cortex and comparatively little overlap with tactile- or auditory-biased regions.

Our design dissociates preparatory (cue phase) and reconstructive (probe phase) mechanisms to isolate the neural signatures of retrieval orientation, the strategic use of cues to optimize retrieval. Whole-brain and ROI analyses revealed that the angular gyrus (AG) and precuneus support perspective-guided retrieval in distinct ways. During the cue phase, PGp showed greater activity for instructed perspectives than natural retrieval, consistent with preparatory perspective selection. During the probe phase, observer-perspective retrieval elicited greater activity in PGp and precuneus (7P), supporting sustained perspective maintenance. Brain-behavior models linked PGp and 7P activity to greater vividness and perspective stability, while precuneus (7M) activity was negatively associated with emotional intensity, especially in the observer condition.

Here, we summarize the origin, evolutionary mechanisms, and expanding host range of the current H5N1 virus (clade 2.3.4.4b) and assess its impact on wildlife. Over the past five years, HPAI has caused the deaths of millions of wild birds, causing dramatic population declines in several seabird species. However, comprehensive quantitative mortality data remain scarce, as existing records are often anecdotal, focus on localized mass die-offs, and thus represent only a fraction of the true magnitude of mortality. This gap in data limits the ability to predict outbreak dynamics and mitigate long-term consequences. Using the Northwestern European Sandwich Tern (Thalasseus sandvicensis) population as a case study, we demonstrate the value of integrating mortality data with ecological, serological and genetic data before, during and after an outbreak. This approach uncovered age-specific vulnerability, selective mortality, and population immunological responses. In addition, insights gained with respect to the role of breeding density, carcass removal, and host adaptation in modulating outbreak dynamics are likely to be generalizable across seabird species. The absence of a centralized and standardized wildlife mortality monitoring framework, on the other hand, remains a major barrier to effective outbreak forecasting and conservation planning. We argue that integrating field-based mortality data, population monitoring, serological assays, and genetic analyses within a One Health framework is essential to enable early detection, targeted mitigation, and robust evaluation of outbreak impacts.

Recognition of self-pollen associates with a single genomic region containing the Phlox S-locus.

While advances in genomic typing, such as core-genome Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (cgMLST, based on 1305 genes), have improved our ability for strain identification, a standardized and stable genomic taxonomy is still lacking. This study aimed to establish a consistent classification and nomenclature for C. diphtheriae strains using cgMLST-based Life Identification Number (LIN) codes. Methods: Comparing 1,665 genomes from C. diphtheriae and its closely related species C. belfantii and C. rouxii, we observed population-level genetic discontinuities in cgMLST profiles dissimilarities, and established hierarchical taxonomic levels based on optimal allelic difference thresholds. Ten-level LIN codes were defined, encompassing broad population structure subdivisions and fine-scale epidemiological levels. The LIN code system was implemented into the BIGSdb-Pasteur platform, and nicknames derived from the 7-loci MLST sequence types were given to sublineages and clonal groups. Results: cgMLST genetic thresholds were first defined at species (minimum of 1,240 allelic differences) and lineage levels (1,035 differences). Sublineages (SL), clonal groups (ClG), and genetic clusters (GC) were next defined with progressively finer allelic mismatch thresholds (500, 55, and 25 differences, respectively). A broad population diversity of C. diphtheriae was uncovered, with the distinction of >400 SLs and >1,000 GCs. For epidemiological purposes, five shallow-level thresholds (8, 4, 2 ,1, and 0 allelic mismatches were defined, completing the 10-level LIN code taxonomy. We illustrate LIN codes applicability to investigate the genetic diversity and transmission chains of relevant clusters, such as SL8 (the 1990s ex-USSR outbreak) or SL384 (involved in outbreaks in Yemen and Europe). Conclusions: The cgMLST-based LIN code system provides a stable genomic taxonomy for strains of C. diphtheriae, C. rouxii and C. belfantii. By defining ten hierarchical levels of resolution, this system effectively captures its phylogenetic diversity, facilitating population biology research and epidemiological surveillance.

Here we combine a recursive Bayesian framework (MacroIR) applied to outside-out patch-clamp recordings, with molecular dynamics simulations, to show that P2X2 activation proceeds via a directional, asymmetric coupling mechanism. ATP binding selectively lowers the energetic barrier for rotation of one subunit at the binding interface, promoting partial activation and substantial conductance, while minimally affecting its neighbor. This rotation, in turn, increases the barrier for subsequent ATP binding, providing a mechanistic explanation for negative cooperativity. In the absence of ligand, elevated barriers stabilize the closed state, quantitatively accounting for spontaneous current fluctuations. These findings overturn the prevailing assumption of symmetric, concerted activation and demonstrate that the classical flip state arises as a necessary physical intermediate. By showing that ligand-induced modulation of activation barriers can drive symmetry breaking in homomeric channels, our results establish a general principle for dynamic protein assemblies and provide a conceptual basis for designing conformation-selective modulators in pain and inflammation.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

S.; Foo, M.; Tang, X.; Kim, J.", "abstract": "Regulating gene expression with precision is essential for cellular engineering and biosensing applications, where rapid, programmable, and sensitive control is desired. Current approaches to regulatory circuit design often rely on control at a single regulatory level, primarily the transcriptional level, thereby limiting the capability of fine-tuning the regulatory dynamics in response to complex stimuli. To address this challenge, we developed four novel RNA-protein hybrid type-1 incoherent feed-forward loop (I1-FFL) circuits in Escherichia coli that integrate transcriptional and translational regulators to achieve multi-level control of gene expression. These hybrid circuits leverage the modularity and rapid dynamics of RNA-based activators alongside the versatile inhibition capabilities of the protein-based repressors, to endow tunable pulse dynamics through engineered delays that act as transient repressor decoys. By repurposing synthetic RNA regulators at multiple regulatory levels together with aptamer and RNA-binding proteins, we demonstrate previously unexplored circuits with tunable dynamics. Complementary simulation results highlighted the importance of the engineered delays in achieving tunable pulse dynamics in these circuits. Integrating modeling insights with experimental validation, we demonstrated the flexibility of designing the RNA-protein hybrid I1-FFL circuits, as well as the tunability of their dynamics, highlighting their suitability for applications in environmental monitoring, metabolic engineering, and other engineered biological systems, where precise temporal control and adaptable gene regulation are desired.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

With the ever-increasing rate of disease, epidemiologic models considering geographic variation in immune responses could prove useful. Despite increasing interest in the macroecology of parasitism and infectious diseases, we know little about the macroecology of immune responses. Host characteristics, parasite exposure, and environmental factors can all affect immunity, but how these factors interact to shape spatial variation in the strength of immune responses remains unexplored. We captured odonates (dragonflies and damselflies) and their conspicuous ectoparasitic mites across a geographic area spanning the temperate and boreal forest biomes in eastern Canada. We then conducted immune response bioassays on 1,237 individuals from 63 odonate species. We used linear regressions and structural equation models to relate immune responses to host body size, parasite load, pH, temperature, and precipitation while accounting for evolutionary relationships among host species. We found significant differences in the strength of immune response among host individuals, and this variation was best explained by climatic conditions, specifically decreasing with precipitation and, to a lesser degree, temperature. While host species significantly differed in immune response strength, we found no effect of host body size, evolutionary relationships among hosts, or parasitism on immune response. Our study investigating the drivers of immune response across dozens of species spread across two biomes is the most comprehensive to date. Climatic conditions have a strong influence on host immune response, regardless of host characteristics or parasitism rates. In this specific case, strong immune responses were associated with low levels of annual precipitation, which could relate to the role of cuticular melanin content in desiccation resistance, and the melanin-based encapsulation response being a byproduct of this adaptation. A spatially-explicit understanding of the biological processes affecting immunity could improve epidemiological models of disease risk that inform disease management globally.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

M.; Sweet, M. G.; Chadwick, S.; Ratliff, J. G.; Mengist, M. F.; Bassil, N. V.; Anandh Babu, P. V.; Iorizzo, M.; Neilson, A. P.", "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) account for ~32% of all deaths worldwide, and atherosclerosis-related conditions are the leading cause of death in the United States. Elevated blood levels of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, are linked to increased risk of atherosclerosis. TMAO is produced when gut bacteria metabolize dietary quaternary amines to trimethylamine (TMA), which is converted to TMAO in the liver. With no FDA-approved drugs available to reduce TMA or TMAO, dietary interventions present the most promising strategy. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), a phenolic abundant in blueberries, inhibits TMA production. Blueberries may thus be a TMA- (and TMAO)-lowering food. CGA content in highbush blueberries varies depending on cultivar, growth conditions, and storage conditions; it remains unclear whether these variations in CGA levels influence the TMA-lowering activity of different blueberry varieties. We investigated the impact of highbush blueberry CGA content on the inhibition of choline-d9 conversion to TMA-d9 in our ex vivo-in vitro human fecal fermentation model. We tested blueberry skins (to avoid interferences from sugar-rich pulp) from 20 genetically distinct highbush blueberry genotypes, chosen based on their high and low CGA content. CGA levels in whole berries ranged from 2.6-146 mg/100 g fresh weight (FW), while CGA concentrations in blueberry skins ranged from 0.14-9.7 mg/g. No significant differences were observed in TMA-d9 production among the 4 highest and 4 lowest CGA genotypes in kinetic curves or area under the curve (AUC) values. However, significant differences were observed between all genotypes compared to controls, with ~19.4.% reduction in TMA-d9 AUCs compared to blank digesta, indicating that phenolic-rich skin provides similar TMA-lowering benefits across blueberry varieties. This suggests that the CGA content of genotypes is not a crucial factor for lowering TMA. Preliminary evidence suggests that fiber is also not the primary driver of the inhibitory activities of blueberry skins. Future studies, including rodent and human studies, are needed to confirm this in vitro study and understand why blueberries may inhibit TMA and potentially TMAO, as in vitro studies have limitations, and the mechanism of TMA reduction remains unclear.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Although the involvement of the Hippo pathway and its kinases Large Tumor Suppressor Kinase 1and 2 (LATS 1 and 2) in mechanical stress responses is known, the mechanisms by which d-flow simultaneously induces senescence, proliferation, and atherothrombosis remain unclear. Methods: The role of endothelial cells (EC)-specific LATS1/2 was examined using EC specific knock-out (EKO) mice in a partial left carotid ligation (PLCL) model. Plaque spatial multi-omics analysis was performed by integrating imaging mass cytometry, sequential immunofluorescence (COMET?), and spatial metabolomics at the single-cell level in human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques. Results: In tamoxifen-inducible Lats1homo(-/-) /Lats2 homo(-/-) EC-specific knockout (EKO) mice, deletion of LATS1/2 induced by tamoxifen led to fatal outcomes, characterized by severe systemic edema and markedly increased vascular permeability. In contrast, Lats1het(+/-)/Lats2 homo(-/-)-EKO mice survived and developed atherothrombotic plaques exhibiting neovascularization even without further additional dietary or genetic intervention. Spatial proteomics analysis revealed that LATS1/2 depletion in ECs triggered a senescence-associated stemness (SAS) phenotype, primarily driven by CD38 upregulation. Complementary spatial metabolomics profiling demonstrated a significant increase in sulfite and taurine within LATS1/2-deficient plaques, indicating lowered sulfite oxidase (SUOX) activity. Mechanistically, CD38 upregulation was found to suppress SUOX expression, induce the reverse mode of mitochondrial complex V, and increase succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity along with ATP consumption. Paradoxically, despite ATP depletion, this metabolic disturbance enhanced glutamate metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, sustaining EC proliferation under energetically stressed conditions. The combined effect of LATS1/2 deletion and CD38 activation established a unique EC phenotype defined by increased SAS, leading to proliferation, senescence, and eventual cell death. These pathological processes culminated in the formation of atherothrombotic plaques, which were attenuated by inhibition of CD38. Notably, a similar phenotype?marked by metabolically active ECs?was observed in human atherothrombotic plaques, suggesting translational relevance. Conclusion: Loss of LATS1/2 in ECs induces SAS state that promotes excessive EC proliferation, senescent cell accumulation, and the development of structurally fragile, leaky neo vessels?hallmarks of atherothrombotic lesions. CD38-mediated SUOX deficiency further amplifies this pathological process by inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, depleting ATP, and triggering compensatory upregulation of glutamate and TCA cycle metabolism. These findings identify a novel LATS1/2?CD38?SUOX axis in ECs that orchestrates SAS-driven atherothrombosis. Targeting CD38 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate vascular dysfunction and plaque instability in high-risk ACS patients.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated how CRISPR-Cas targeting affects mating and gene exchange in the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii. Surprisingly, we found that CRISPR-Cas targeting significantly increased mating efficiency between members of the same species, in contrast to its previously documented role in reducing inter-species mating. This enhanced mating efficiency was dependent on the Cas3 nuclease/helicase and extended beyond the targeted genomic regions. Further analysis revealed that CRISPR-Cas targeting promoted biased recombination in favour of the targeting strain during mating, resulting in an increased proportion of recombinant progeny that are positive for CRISPR-Cas. To test whether an increase in recombination is sufficient to increase mating efficiency, we tested whether strains lacking the MRE11-RAD50 complex, which are known to have elevated recombination activity, also exhibited higher mating success. Indeed, these strains showed higher mating, as did cells that were exposed to DNA damage using methyl methanesulfonate.

Gene-environment interactions can lead to differential phenotypic variability across genotype groups, therefore, genetic variants that interact with environmental exposures can manifest as vQTLs. Although changes in DNA methylation variability have been observed in several diseases, vQTLs for methylation levels (vmeQTL) have not yet been explored in depth. Results: We optimize the value of monozygotic (MZ) twin studies to identify and replicate vmeQTLs for blood DNA methylation variance at 358 CpGs in 988 adult MZ twin pairs from two European twin registries. Over a third of vmeQTLs captured identical vmeQTL-environmental factor interactions in both datasets, and the majority of interactions were observed with blood cell counts. Correspondingly, over 60% of CpGs affected by genotype-monocyte and genotype-T cell interactions replicated as CpGs affected by genetic effects in the relevant cell type in an independent dataset. Most vmeQTLs also replicated in 1,348 UK non-twin adults and showed longitudinal stability in a sample subset. Integrating gene expression and phenotype association results identified multiple vmeQTLs that capture GxE effects relevant to human health.

Human Siglecs count 14 unique proteins allocated to two subsets; group 1 includes four evolutionarily conserved proteins with clear orthologues in all mammals with low sequence similarity and group 2 includes ten rapidly evolving proteins with high sequence similarity and species specificity. In all Siglecs, the recognition and binding of the sialic acid on the glycan target involves a conserved, or canonical, Arg residue. Yet, for a subset of human Siglecs, namely MAG, Siglec-6, and Siglec-11, this Arg appears not to be essential, suggesting that a different binding mechanism may be at play. In this work, we used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding assays, and mutagenesis to investigate the structural, mechanistic and energetic details of the binding of Siglec-6 to monosialylated gangliosides.

Whole-genome transcriptome analysis revealed enriched metabolic entities promoting hydrolysis of glutamine and glutaminolysis in glioma cells and inhibition of selected differentially enriched genes with small molecule inhibitors abrogated metabolic enrichment and resulted in reduced energy levels and protein translation required for aberrant growth. Finally, we establish that DCX stimulates glutaminolysis to regulate homeostasis for energy supplements in glioma cells. Targeting DCX-mediated metabolic pathways may provide a novel therapeutic approach for glioblastoma, highlighting the potential for innovative treatments in this challenging disease.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Studying eukaryotic P450s has been limited by their dependence on membrane association and requirement for partner reductases. Here, we demonstrate cell-free synthesis and assay of human P450s 3A4 and 2D6 using Leishmania tarentolae translational extract. These P450s were co-expressed with various NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductases (CPRs), and activity was assayed directly using unpurified reactions. P450s 3A4 and 2D6 showed distinct preferences in reductase coupling: P450 3A4 activity was greatest when coupled to the human CPR, whereas P450 2D6 performed better when co-expressed with CPRs from Arabidopsis thaliana. Inhibition assays with chloramphenicol, terbinafine, and erythromycin yielded results consistent with known P450-drug interactions. We conclude that Leishmania-based cell-free protein synthesis resolves previous challenges in eukaryotic P450 expression, allowing for rapid and convenient functional studies of unmodified eukaryotic P450 systems, offering a practical tool for drug metabolism studies and biocatalyst discovery.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Alcohol can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and alter the structure and function of PCs. Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an ER stress inducible protein highly expressed in PCs. It is neuroprotective in various pathological conditions where ER stress is induced. However, it is unknown whether MANF plays a role in protecting PCs from alcohol induced ER stress. In this study, we generated PC-specific MANF knockout (KO) mouse model to test the hypothesis that MANF deficient PCs are more susceptible to binge alcohol exposure induced ER stress and neurodegeneration in the adult brain. We found that PC-specific MANF KO animals show moderate motor function deficit, which was exacerbated by alcohol exposure. Interestingly, female KOs were more sensitive than male KOs to alcohol-induced motor function impairments. In accordance with the behavior changes, alcohol exposure also caused UPR activation, increased intranuclear expression of calcium binding protein Calbindin, and PC degeneration in female but not male MANF KO mice. Spatial transcriptomics and high throughput in situ analyses demonstrated that MANF deficiency altered the transcriptomic landscape in PCs in a sex-specific manner and triggered the expression of genes involved in protein folding and response to ER stress. These results suggests that MANF KO PCs may be predisposed with a higher risk to UPR activation and ER stress in a sex dependent manner, contributing to their vulnerability to alcohol neurotoxicity.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Additionally, many are involved in blooms and toxin production, affecting environmental quality. Despite their crucial role, some of their characteristics are only now being understood with the development of molecular techniques independent of cultivation. Thus, the recent effort to unify classical and microbial ecology studies has led to a better understanding of their dynamics. Here, we investigate the temporal processes that influence bacterial abundance and persistence, as well as their role in promoting or inhibiting the presence of certain organisms in the core of a metacommunity. Using molecular approaches such as amplicon and metagenomic analyses, we retrieved information on key bacteria (those with high abundance and/or persistence) from the South Atlantic Microbial Observatory (SAMO) to assess their interactions with environmental and biological factors. We identified a significant relationship between diversity changes, temperature, and nutrient availability, in a recurrent pattern that clusters winter-spring and summer-autumn communities, suggesting a connection with the seasonal changes in marine currents characteristic of this region. Among the key organisms, SAR11 and Flavobacteriaceae stand out. Flavobacteriaceae is known for its adaptive capacity and large genomes, while SAR11 has a reduced genome, making it dependent on compounds produced by other organisms. We identified an annual fluctuation in its abundance linked to Synechococcus blooms. The significant co-occurrence of ASVs from both groups reinforces the evidence of a biological interaction that sustains SAR11 through the exchange of these compounds. Through this study, we contribute to clarifying the factors that locally influence the geographic patterns of marine bacteria and identifying the pathways that promote their dynamics and functions in the ecosystem.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to have a wide range of triggers including fungal, bacterial and viral components, cellular stress and environmental irritants. The NLRP3 inflammasome has been well characterised in mouse and humans but limited information is available from other mammalian species. In order to gain a better understanding of the evolution of genes involved in the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, we examined them in mammalian species representing the three major groups (eutheria, metatheria and prototheria) and in chicken as an outgroup. Our results show that the inflammasome pathway machinery is generally well conserved though chicken appears to lack several key components and monotremes have a duplication of Syk. Analysis of the proinflammatory caspase cluster and neighboring genes revealed massive reorganisation as well as the previously described multiple duplications that occurred during mammalian evolution. Our data suggest that Caspase-1 moved to a new chromosomal region in early mammalian evolution. This was followed by expansion of the cluster and accumulation of additional genes regulating inflammatory responses such as Card16, Card17, Card18 and the Birc genes. The expansion of key gene families flanking Caspase-1 may have led to an expansion of inflammasome pathways and a more regulated immune system in humans through the CARD genes.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

PolyP remains poorly understood in mammals due to its low abundance and lack of information on its synthesis and regulation. Using synthetic polyP8 as a bait, we identified polyP interacting proteins involved in RNA splicing, transcription, and mitochondrial function. We developed a DAPI fluorescence-based assay to quantify the low levels of polyP present in mammalian cell lines and tissues, and detected a higher concentration of polyP in the mitochondria compared with the nucleus and post-mitochondrial fraction. We observed that mitochondrial polyP synthesis relies on active FoF1 ATP synthase and an intact proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. Our data shows that orthophosphate (Pi) is required for the generation of mitochondrial polyP and that the presence of ATP enhances Pi-driven polyP synthesis in isolated mitochondria. We discovered that the inositol pyrophosphate 5-InsP7, synthesized by IP6K1, regulates mitochondrial polyP levels. Mice and cells deficient in IP6K1 showed a significant reduction in mitochondrial polyP synthesis compared with wild type controls. Cells lacking IP6K1 also showed impaired mitochondrial respiration and membrane potential. The expression of active IP6K1, but not its catalytically inactive form, restored mitochondrial polyP synthesis and membrane potential in IP6K1 deficient cells, but mitochondrial respiration was rescued by expression of either active or inactive IP6K1. These data show that IP6K1 regulates mitochondrial function and polyP production through both the synthesis of 5-InsP7 and via a catalytic activity-independent mechanism. Our findings uncover a link between 5-InsP7, an energy sensor, and polyP, an energy store, in the regulation of mammalian mitochondrial homeostasis.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the ability of the extremophilic yeast Debaryomyces hansenii to activate specialized detoxification mechanisms for BaP degradation, even under nutrient-deprived conditions. When exposed to 100 ppm BaP, D. hansenii eliminated over 70% of the contaminant within three days while maintaining normal growth dynamics. RNA-Seq analysis revealed widespread transcriptional remodeling, with 1179 genes upregulated and 1031 downregulated under BaP-only conditions, and 1067 upregulated and 977 downregulated genes during co-metabolic exposure (2% glucose + 100 ppm BaP), from a total of 6506 annotated genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG enrichment analyses highlighted the activation of xenobiotic degradation pathways, notably involving cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs), epoxide hydrolases (EHs), and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), alongside an enhanced antioxidant response and finely tuned glutathione homeostasis. This work provides the first comprehensive transcriptomic profile of BaP detoxification in D. hansenii, revealing an intricate and highly adaptive stress response. Collectively, these findings position D. hansenii as a promising eukaryotic platform for bioremediation in saline and contaminated environments, especially where conventional microbial candidates fall short due to environmental extremes or nutrient scarcity.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Recently, it has been proposed that NADPH acts as a key molecule in pentose phosphate pathway regulation by exerting negative feedback through tonic inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Interestingly, recent studies show that NADPH levels remain stable during acute exposure to hydrogen peroxide in the presence of glucose, ruling out NADPH-dependent feedback inhibition. We hypothesize that hydrogen peroxide triggers a feedforward activation mechanism, increasing NADPH production even before any detectable NADPH depletion. To probe this hypothesis, we used a panel of genetically encoded fluorescent indicators to monitor glucose, NADPH, F1,6BP, and pyruvate in single cells with high temporal resolution. Our results reveal that hydrogen peroxide rapidly activates glucose transport and consumption rates, enabling cells to preserve NADPH steady-state levels during early oxidative stress. Notably, this response precedes NADPH depletion, implying an anticipatory phenomenon that boosts NADPH production prior to its consumption. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide induced an acute perturbation of F1,6BP steady-state and an increase of pyruvate accumulation. The pharmacological inhibition of the PPP s gateway enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and transketolase, abolished the hydrogen peroxide-dependent alterations in F1,6BP steady-state levels and pyruvate accumulation, respectively. These findings suggest that a substantial fraction of glucose-derived carbon flux is diverted to the pentose phosphate pathway under oxidative stress, underscoring the importance of feedforward control in maintaining redox balance.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Our findings reveal a stromal alkalinization signature induced by photosynthetic proton pumping, extending to the cytosol and mitochondria as an 'alkalinization wave'. Photosynthesis leads to increased MgATP2- levels in both the stroma and cytosol. Additionally, we observed reduction of the NAD pool driven by photosynthesis-derived electron export. Arabidopsis lines defective in chloroplast NADP- and mitochondrial NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenases show more reduced cytosolic NAD redox status even in darkness, highlighting the involvement of chloroplasts and mitochondria in shaping cytosolic redox metabolism via malate metabolism.

All these endeavors make use of the innate metabolic activity of cell lysates. However, our knowledge of the underlying nature of cell-free metabolism remains lacking. In this work, we use non-targeted mass spectrometry to generate time-course measurements of small molecules in E. coli cell lysates (metabolomics) during cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) to show that the majority of E. coli's metabolism is active in cell lysate. Furthermore, these data indicate that protein synthesis is a relatively small metabolic burden on cell lysates compared to the background metabolism, and that the build-up of multiple metabolic waste products is fundamentally responsible for stopping cell-free protein expression as opposed to depletion of fuel sources. We use these insights coupled with high-throughput CFPS experiments to develop a foundational coarse-grained mechanistic model of CFPS which we show can be easily recalibrated using Bayesian parameter inference techniques to provide accurate models across hundreds of novel experimental conditions.

Substituting ATP with alternative nucleotides in this reaction would enable the synthesis of FAD nucleotide analogues. This study explores nucleotide selectivity of the Escherichia coli FMNAT domain. Mutant enzyme variants were engineered which produce FAD analogues. Chromosomal substitution of the wild-type E. coli FAD synthetase with a mutated version resulted in the intracellular synthesis of FAD analogues and conferred increased tolerance to aminoglycoside antibiotics. These findings validate the FMNAT domain loop as a viable site for cofactor engineering, with potential synthetic biology applications.

During weeks of cold exposure, FLC transcription is progressively reduced both by transcriptional repression mediated by FLC antisense transcription, and epigenetic silencing implemented through a Polycomb-mediated epigenetic switch. In the warm, FLC is transcriptionally repressed by coordinated changes in transcription initiation and RNA PolII speed in a mechanism involving proximal termination. Whether similar mechanisms contribute to the cold-induced FLC transcriptional repression is unknown. Here, we combine mathematical modelling and transcription profiling to investigate FLC transcriptional changes during the cold. We find different dynamics of spliced and unspliced transcripts during cold exposure with only a small change in PolII speed. We also show that, unlike short-term cold, long-term cold temperatures drive an increase in splicing rates while simultaneously reducing productive transcription at FLC. This process is influenced by antisense COOLAIR transcription but does not rely on proximal COOLAIR termination. Cold-induced transcriptional repression of FLC thus involves a decoupling of changes in productive transcription initiation from PolII speed and rates of co-transcriptional splicing, a different mechanism to that repressing FLC in the warm.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}

Current approaches to risk mapping vary widely in their methodology, data sources, output metrics and applications. Many existing approaches focus on predicting ecological suitability and produce high-resolution risk maps based on environmental conditions, yet high-resolution incidence maps remain scarce, leaving a critical gap in guiding precise, location-specific interventions. The prediction of disease incidence or transmission intensity remains relatively uncommon in disease ecology, largely due to data limitations, reporting biases, and the inherent complexity that arises from transmission dynamics. In this study, we applied disaggregation regression modelling to downscale aggregated dengue case data from 14 countries in Central and South America, generating fine-resolution incidence estimates that we subsequently projected onto the African continent. We then compared the resulting predictions from the incidence-based risk map with three widely used approaches: vector suitability index, dengue environmental suitability index, and mechanistic transmission potential (Index P). The disaggregation model achieved relatively strong predictive accuracy within the training region (mean correlation = 0.72) and showed partial alignment with reported burden across Africa (Spearman {rho} = 0.33). Other risk maps exhibited similar or weaker correlations with reported cases in Africa, including {rho} = 0.33 for dengue environmental suitability, {rho} = 0.32 for transmission potential and {rho} = 0.23 for Aedes aegypti suitability. Disaggregation regression offers a valuable tool for translating reported case data into spatially explicit estimates of burden, bridging the gap between ecological risk and epidemiological relevance. While spatial agreement was high in parts of coastal West Africa across the different risk map approaches, notable divergences highlight the distinct assumptions underlying each framework.", "date": "2025-06-21", "journal": ""}
