Ecological differences can generate recombination barriers between species and sustain genomic clusters in the short term. But can these forces prevent genomic mixing during long-term coevolution? Cyanobacteria in Yellowstone hot springs comprise several diverse species that have coevolved for hundreds of thousands of years, providing a rare natural experiment. By analyzing more than 300 single-cell genomes, we show that despite each species forming a distinct genomic cluster, much of the diversity within species is the result of hybridization driven by selection, which has mixed their ancestral genotypes. This widespread mixing is contrary to the prevailing view that ecological barriers can maintain cohesive bacterial species and highlights the importance of hybridization as a source of genomic diversity.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

The most popular current approach is imaging fluorescence-based genetically encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs). While fluorescent probes are useful in many contexts, bioluminescence-based GECIs--probes that generate light through oxidation of a small-molecule by a luciferase or photoprotein--have several distinct advantages. Because bioluminescent (BL) GECIs do not use the bright extrinsic excitation light required for fluorescence, BL GECIs do not photobleach, do not suffer from nonspecific autofluorescent background, and do not cause phototoxicity. Further, BL GECIs can be applied in contexts where directly shining photons on an imaging target is not possible. Despite these advantages, the use of BL GECIs has to date been limited by their small changes in bioluminescence intensity, high baseline signal at resting Ca2+ concentrations, and suboptimal Ca2+ affinities. Here, we describe a new BL GECI, CaBLAM (Ca2+ BioLuminescence Activity Monitor), that displays much higher dynamic range than previous BL GECIs and has a Ca2+ affinity suitable for capturing physiological changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. With these improvements, CaBLAM captures single-cell and subcellular resolution activity at high frame rates in cultured neurons and in vivo, and allows multi-hour recordings in mice and behaving zebrafish. This new advance provides a robust alternative to traditional fluorescent GECIs that can enable or enhance imaging across many experimental conditions.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

These oligodendrocyte and astrocyte enhancer-AAVs are highly specific (usually > 95% cell type specificity) with variable expression levels, and the astrocyte enhancer-AAVs show multiple distinct expression patterns reflecting the spatial distribution of astrocyte cell types. To provide the best glial-specific functional tools, several enhancer-AAVs were: optimized for higher expression levels, shown to be functional and specific in rat and macaque, shown to maintain specific activity across transgenes and in epilepsy where traditional promoters changed activity, and used to drive functional transgenes in astrocytes including Cre recombinase and acetylcholine-responsive sensor iAChSnFR. The astrocyte-specific iAChSnFR revealed a clear reward-dependent acetylcholine response in astrocytes of the nucleus accumbens during reinforcement learning.

These rhythms continuously fluctuate, signaling major changes in vigilance, but the widespread brain dynamics underlying these oscillations are difficult to investigate. Using simultaneous EEG and fast fMRI in humans who fell asleep inside the scanner, we developed a machine learning approach to investigate which fMRI regions and networks predict fluctuations in neural rhythms. We demonstrated that the rise and fall of alpha (8-12 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) power, two canonical EEG bands critically involved with cognition and vigilance, can be predicted from fMRI data in subjects that were not present in the training set. This approach also identified predictive information in individual brain regions across the cortex and subcortex. Finally, we developed an approach to identify shared and unique predictive information, and found that information about alpha rhythms was highly separable in two networks linked to arousal and visual systems. Conversely, delta rhythms were diffusely represented on a large spatial scale primarily across the cortex. These results demonstrate that EEG rhythms can be predicted from fMRI data, identify large-scale network patterns that underlie alpha and delta rhythms, and establish a novel framework for investigating multimodal brain dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Although intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) has reduced neonatal disease rates, persistent GBS colonization has been observed in patients following prophylaxis. To determine whether IAP selects for genomic signatures that enhance GBS survival and persistence, a pangenome analysis was performed on 97 isolates from 58 participants before (prenatal) and after (postpartum) IAP/childbirth. Thirty-one of the 34 paired strains from participants with persistent colonization clustered together in the core gene phylogeny, suggesting that the strains recovered at the postpartum sampling were highly similar to those recovered at the prenatal visit. A core-gene mutation analysis identified mutations in 74% (n=23) of the 31 postpartum genomes when compared to the prenatal strains of the same multilocus sequence type recovered from the same individuals. Several strains had acquired mutations in the same colonization-associated genes, though two postpartum strains accounted for most of the mutations. These two outliers were classified as mutators based on high mutation rates and mutations within DNA repair system genes. Increased biofilm production was observed in half of the postpartum strains relative to the prenatal strains, which is supported by the presence of point mutations in genes associated with adherence. Together, these findings suggest that antibiotics may impose a selective pressure on GBS that selects for mutations and phenotypes that promote adaptation and survival in vivo. Enhanced survival in the genitourinary tract can lead to persistent colonization, increasing the likelihood of invasive disease in subsequent pregnancies and in newborns following IAP.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Existing genomic language models have utilized various tokenization methods, including character tokenization, overlapping and non-overlapping k-mer tokenization, and byte-pair encoding, a method widely used in natural language models. Genomic sequences differ from natural language because of their low character variability, complex and overlapping features, and inconsistent directionality. These features make sub-word tokenization in genomic language models significantly different from both traditional language models and protein language models. This study explores the impact of tokenization in genomic language models by evaluating their downstream performance on forty-four classification fine-tuning tasks. We also perform a direct comparison of byte pair encoding and character tokenization in Mamba, a state-space model. Our results indicate that character tokenization outperforms sub-word tokenization methods on tasks that rely on nucleotide level resolution, such as splice site prediction and promoter detection.

This heterogeneity arises from pronounced cell-to-cell variability in ecDNA copy number, enabling complex ecDNA amplicon compositions within individual tumour cells. Approximately one-third of ecDNA-positive tumours harbour multiple co-selected ecDNA species. However, the mechanisms governing the heterogeneity and persistence of ecDNA variants - beyond the presence of distinct ecDNA species - remain less well understood. In particular, little is known about the maintenance of genetic or phenotypic diversity within a single ecDNA species. Here, we develop computational models to investigate the dynamics that enable the stable maintenance of tumour cells carrying multiple ecDNA variants ('mixed cells'). We explore how variant switching contributes to the persistence of ecDNA diversity under varying fitness regimes. Our results demonstrate that both a positive fitness of ecDNA+ cells and variant switching are required to maintain mixed cell subpopulations, whereas direct co-selection of mixed cells is not necessary. Notably, the fraction of mixed cells peaks at intermediate switching rates across fitness landscapes, a pattern reflected in subpopulation structures, transition probabilities between pure and mixed ecDNA states, and single-cell Shannon diversity indices.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

In this study, we present CNV-Finder, a novel pipeline integrating deep learning techniques on array data, specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to expedite the large-scale identification of CNVs within predefined genomic regions. This facilitates efficient prioritization of samples for time-consuming or costly subsequent analyses such as Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), short-read, and long-read whole genome sequencing. We incorporate four genes to establish our methods--Parkin (PRKN), Leucine Rich Repeat And Ig Domain Containing 2 (LINGO2), Microtubule Associated Protein Tau (MAPT), and alpha-Synuclein (SNCA)--which may be relevant to neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), or related disorders such as essential tremor (ET).

However, applying eDNA to monitor abundance remains contentious, as eDNA particle dynamics and the ecology of eDNA production can decouple this relationship in natural ecosystems. To address this, we provide a novel modeling method to produce population estimates from eDNA. We integrated bioenergetics and mass-balance frameworks to relate eDNA concentrations to freshwater fish population abundance estimated through conventional mark-recapture in Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) across nine Rocky Mountains lakes, five of which underwent size-selective harvesting over two years. Our integrated framework improved the variance explained in eDNA concentrations from 24% to 71%.

Yet, we can intentionally stop this process and thus prevent the memory from entering awareness. Such suppression not only transiently hinders the retrieval of the memory, it can also induce forgetting. Neuroimaging has implicated the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in initiating this process. Specifically, this region seems to downregulate activity in brain systems that would otherwise support the reinstatement of the memory. We here probed the causal contribution of the right dlPFC to suppression by combining the Think/No-Think task with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Participants first learned pairs of cue and target words, and then repeatedly recalled some of the targets (think condition) and suppressed others (no-think condition). We applied 10 Hz rTMS bursts to the right dlPFC during the suppression of half the no-think items, and to the contra-lateral primary motor area (M1) as an active control site during the other half. As hypothesized, participants experienced less success at keeping the memories out of awareness with concurrent dlPFC than M1 stimulation. Similarly, a memory test yielded evidence for suppression-induced forgetting (SIF) following M1 but not dlPFC stimulation. However, the difference in forgetting between the stimulation conditions was not significant. The study thus provides causal evidence for the role of the dlPFC in preventing retrieval. Future work will need to conclusively establish the relationship between this transient effect and suppression-induced forgetting.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

However, an upstream role for behavioral circadian disruption in regulating AD pathology remains an open question. Methods: To determine the role of the central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in regulating amyloid pathology, we generated mice harboring deletion of the critical clock gene Bmal1 in GABAergic neurons using VGAT-iCre, which is expressed in >95% of SCN cells, and crossed this line to the 5xFAD amyloid mouse model. To examine the role of the light-dark cycle in this process, we aged these mice in either regular 12:12 light-dark (LD) or constant darkness (DD) conditions. Transcriptional, behavioral, and physiological rhythms were examined in VGAT-iCre; Bmal1fl/fl; 5xFAD (VGAT-BMAL1KO;5xFAD) mice under varying light conditions. Amyloid plaque deposition, peri-plaque tau phosphorylation, glial activation, and transcriptomic changes were examined. Results: VGAT-Bmal1KO;5xFAD mice showed loss of SCN BMAL1 expression and severe disruption of behavioral rhythms in both LD and DD, with loss of day-night rhythms in consolidated sleep and blunting of rhythmic clock gene expression in the brain. Surprisingly, VGAT-BmalKO;5xFAD mice kept under LD showed reduced total plaque accumulation and peri-plaque tau phosphorylation, compared to Cre-negative controls. These changes were gated by the light-dark cycle, as they were absent in VGAT-Bmal1KO;5xFAD mice kept in DD conditions. Total plaque accumulation was also reduced in control 5xFAD mice kept in DD as compared to LD, suggesting a general effect of light-dark cycle on amyloid aggregation. Expression of murine presenilin 1 (Psen1) and beta-secretase (Bace1), proteases which catalyze the processing of APP into amyloid beta, as well as APP cleavage to C-terminal fragments, were suppressed in VGAT-Bmal1KO;5xFAD under LD conditions. Conclusions: In 5xFAD mice, the central circadian clock and the light-dark cycle interact to regulate amyloid pathology. Disruption of the central clock in the presence of a light-dark cycle may reduce APP cleavage and plaque formation. These results call into question the proposed simple positive feedback loop between circadian rhythm disruption and Alzheimer's Disease pathology.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

All phytoplankton experience gravitational sinking, which can contribute to their vertical migration. However, the biophysical and molecular mechanisms that impact gravitational sinking have not been systematically characterized across taxa and environmental conditions. Here, we combine simulations with measurements of cell mass, volume, and composition to investigate the effects of nutrient availability on gravitational sinking in 9 representative unicellular pico- and nanoplankton species. We find that gravitational sinking becomes faster in most species when starved, but the biophysical changes responsible for this vary across species and starvation conditions. For example, the faster sinking of Chaetoceros calcitrans is nearly exclusively driven by cell density whereas that of Emiliania huxleyi is due to cell volume. On the molecular level, the altered sinking is predominantly attributed to changes in cellular dry contents, rather than water. For example, starch accumulation increases sinking in 3 green algae species, and lipid accumulation decreases sinking in Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Overall, our work reveals that phytoplankton physiology has evolved multiple mechanisms that impact gravitational sinking in response to starvation, possibly to support the vertical migration of the cell.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

IGF-1 was lower in years of high population density when per capita food availability was reduced; in twin lambs who have fewer available resources compared to singletons; and in lambs born to young and old mothers, who have poor maternal provisioning compared to mothers of intermediate age. Higher IGF-1 levels in summer were correlated with higher body mass, faster post-natal somatic growth and increased skeletal size, measured at the same time. These associations were independent of our proxies of resource availability. Lambs with higher summer IGF-1 were more likely to survive their first winter and reproduce the following spring. The association between IGF-1 and reproduction was independent of our resource availability proxies, whereas the association with first-winter survival was not. The association between summer IGF-1 and reproduction was mediated by positive associations with summer body mass. Our study reveals population-level phenotypic plasticity in circulating IGF-1, also finding IGF-1 to be positively associated with key morphological traits and positively predict fitness traits in early life. These findings highlight IGF-1 as a candidate physiological mechanism underpinning plastic responses to variation in food availability and influencing life-history traits in a wild mammal.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

M.; Sridharan, R.; Roy, S.", "abstract": "Reconstructing genome-scale gene regulatory networks (GRNs) remains a difficult problem in systems biology, and many experimental and computational methods have been developed to address this problem. Recent computational methods have aimed to more accurately model GRNs by estimating the hidden Transcription Factor Activity (TFA) from prior knowledge of TF target regulatory connections, encoded as an input directed graph, to relax the assumption that mRNA level of the regulator correlates with the protein activity of the regulator. However, the noise in the prior knowledge can adversely affect the estimated TFA levels and the quality of the downstream inferred GRNs. Here, we present a new approach, MERLIN+P+TFA, that uses prior knowledge-guided sparsity regularization to robustly and accurately estimate TFA and downstream GRNs. We apply our method to simulated and real expression data in yeast and mammalian systems and show improved quality of inferred GRNs for both bulk and single-cell datasets. Regularized TFA offers benefits to a variety of other GRN inference algorithms, including those that have traditionally been used with expression alone, in both bulk and scRNA-seq settings. We used the inferred GRN to prioritize key regulators for the mouse Embryonic Stem Cell (mESC) state and validate 58 regulators experimentally. We identified both known and novel regulators of the mESC state and further validate the targets of 4 known and novel regulators. Our validation experiments suggest that computationally inferred networks can capture functional targets of TFs with higher precision than estimated in current benchmarks, however, it is important to generate context-specific gold standards.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "How do precision of movement and proprioception influence motor control and adaptation? Several theories - such as the exploration-exploitation hypothesis - propose that variability plays a key role in motor performance and learning. However, empirical measures of motor and proprioceptive precision are often limited by small sample sizes, and proprioceptive estimates, especially those relying on efferent signals, are difficult to isolate and quantify. In this study, we leveraged a large dataset of 270 participants - including a subsample of older adults (ages 54-84) - to assess the precision of hand movements and proprioceptive estimates, and to examine whether these factors predict individual differences in motor learning and adaptation. We found that baseline reach variance did not predict learning or changes in hand localization. Although active hand localization (which includes efferent contributions) was slightly more precise - showing an 8.6% reduction in variance - this suggests that unseen hand estimates rely primarily on proprioception. Neither motor nor sensory precision varied with age. However, reach aftereffects were modestly associated with proprioceptive precision before training and proprioceptive recalibration after training. No other measure of learning or variance was reliably associated. These findings suggest that reach aftereffects may partly reflect changes in hand proprioception, but overall, we identified no predictors of adaptation to a rotated visual cursor.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Additionally, many are involved in blooms and toxin production, affecting environmental quality. Despite their crucial role, some of their characteristics are only now being understood with the development of molecular techniques independent of cultivation. Thus, the recent effort to unify classical and microbial ecology studies has led to a better understanding of their dynamics. Here, we investigate the temporal processes that influence bacterial abundance and persistence, as well as their role in promoting or inhibiting the presence of certain organisms in the core of a metacommunity. Using molecular approaches such as amplicon and metagenomic analyses, we retrieved information on key bacteria (those with high abundance and/or persistence) from the South Atlantic Microbial Observatory (SAMO) to assess their interactions with environmental and biological factors. Bimodality was hardly observable, while the community structuring reflected the influence of large scale environmental processes in a recurrent pattern that clusters winter-spring and summer-autumn communities, reinforcing previous findings of intense influence of marine currents in this region. Among the key organisms, SAR11 and Flavobacteriaceae stand out. Flavobacteriaceae is known for its adaptive capacity and large genomes, while SAR11 has a reduced genome, making it dependent on compounds produced by other organisms. We identified an annual fluctuation in its abundance linked to Synechococcus blooms. The significant co-occurrence of ASVs from both groups reinforces the evidence of a biological interaction that sustains SAR11 through the exchange of these compounds. Through this study, we contribute to clarifying the factors that locally influence the geographic patterns of marine bacteria and identifying the pathways that promote their dynamics and functions in the ecosystem.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Thirteen key genes (TERT, NOX4, MMP9, TRIM67, ZDHHC18, HDAC1, TUBB6, ADM, NOG, CHEK2, KCNJ11, KCNIP2, and VEGFA) proved to be closely associated with glioma subtypes as well as survival.

Fluorescence microscopy revealed that tonal stimuli with coherent low-frequency patterns enhanced actin polymerization and shmoo formation, both markers of polarity and mating. In contrast, broadband noise disrupted actin integrity, while consonants produced no measurable effects. These results suggest that rhythmic continuity and spectral coherence, key features of speech, can modulate cytoskeletal organization in non-auditory cells.

Here we take inspiration from empirical thalamocortical discovery and develop a multiplicative coupling mechanism between RNN-FNN architectures that collectively enhance their computational strengths and learning. The multiplicative interaction imposes a Hebbian-weight amplification onto synaptic-neuronal coupling, enabling context-dependent gating and rapid switching. We demonstrate that multiplicative feedback-driven synaptic plasticity achieves 2-100 folds of speed improvement in supervised, reinforcement and unsupervised learning settings, boosting memory capacity, model robustness and generalization of RNNs. We further demonstrate the efficacy and biological plausibility of multiplicative gating in modeling multiregional circuits, including a prefrontal cortex-mediodorsal thalamus network for context-dependent decision making, a cortico-thalamic-cortical network for working memory and attention, and an entorhinal cortex-hippocampus network for visuospatial navigation and sequence replay.

While species-specific differences in the distribution of stomata persist between P. balsamifera and P. trichocarpa, hybrids on average resembled P. trichocarpa. Admixture mapping identified several candidate genes associated with stomatal trait variation in hybrids including TWIST, a homolog of SPEECHLESS in Arabidopsis, that initiates stomatal development via asymmetric cell divisions. Geographic clines revealed candidate genes deviating from genome-wide average patterns of introgression, suggesting restricted gene flow and the maintenance of adaptive differences. Climate associations, particularly with precipitation, indicated selection shapes local ancestry at candidate genes across transects.

Here we investigate the development of this functional dissociation, and the dissociation of their underlying connectivity fingerprints in a large cohort of children (ages 4-9 years, n=58 sessions) and adults (n=29). We demonstrate for the first time that children show distinct patterns of neural specificity for language and ToM in STL, just like adults. Children show no evidence of developmental 'disentangling' cross-sectionally or longitudinally. Finally, children's connectivity fingerprints predicting future language or ToM activation are almost identical to concurrent fingerprints and are largely non-overlapping across domains. While linguistic and ToM processing undergo continued neural specialization to reach the mature adult-like state, they are distinct remarkably early in human development.

In this study, we investigated EXOC6A, a component of the exocyst complex known for secretory vesicle trafficking and fusion, and found that it interacts with myosin-Va (Myo-Va) during ciliogenesis. EXOC6A colocalizes with Myo-Va at various stages of ciliogenesis, including preciliary vesicles, ciliary vesicles (CVs), and ciliary sheath membrane during ciliogenesis. We found that EXOC6A vesicles are actively recruited, integrated, and exit from the CVs and the ciliary sheath, implying that EXOC6A vesicles may facilitate continuous cilia membrane remodeling during ciliogenesis. Importantly, EXOC6A knockout impairs ciliogenesis, arresting most cells at the CV stage and preventing recruitment of NPHP and MKS module components to the transition zone. Furthermore, EXOC6A vesicles are transported to the mother centriole via a dynein-, microtubule-, and actin-dependent mechanism.

These neurons respond to social touch, mature in a sensory experience-dependent manner, and influence both somatosensory processing and social behavior in models of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) are an ideal rodent model for studying these concepts since they engage in a species-typical social touch called huddling. This study first showed that over development from juvenile to adult, same-sex siblings huddled less and explored more. Next, we tracked two markers of plasticity indicative of PVI maturation, extracellular perineuronal nets (PNNs) and nuclear transcription factor Myocyte enhancing factor 2C (Mef2c) across seven developmental timepoints. We found that, while PV expression in S1 was stable by P21, PNNs and Mef2c continued to shift afterwards, indicating a protracted development. Four unique clusters of PVIs converge during development between P14-P21, suggesting a sensitive period of PVI development. Finally, to determine environmental factors affecting these processes, environmental enrichment between P21-P28 led to accelerated PVI maturation.

While pRF mapping has advanced our understanding of visual cortical organization, evidence linking variation in pRF properties to behavioral performance remains limited. One of the most compelling pRF-to-behavior relationships has emerged from research into developmental prosopagnosia (DP). Individuals with DP have severe deficits in facial identity recognition sometimes linked to diminished holistic processing of faces. This perceptual deficit could be explained at the neural level by abnormally small pRFs in face-selective regions that restrict spatial integration of the face information. This hypothesis is supported by data from a small group of DPs but needs to be rigorously evaluated in a larger sample. Here, we measured pRF properties in 20 individuals with DP and 20 controls using a stimulus designed to robustly activate both low- and high-level visual areas. Consistent with previous studies, DPs exhibited weaker face selectivity in core ventral face-selective areas. Crucially, however, across the visual processing hierarchy - from early visual cortex, to intermediate visual areas, and face-selective areas - DPs and controls exhibited remarkable similarity in pRF properties, including pRF size, visual field coverage, and the distribution of pRF centers. Using a larger sample and the latest methods for mapping and modeling pRFs, these results challenge theories attributing DP to reduced spatial integration in face-selective regions.

As such, there are still no vascular grafts that can be used in blood vessels where their diameters are less than 6 mm in patients. Although various approaches have been evaluated to mitigate implant-associated fibrosis, effective treatments remain quite limited. In this study, we demonstrated that APOE was significantly increased during vascular regeneration after graft implantation in vivo. APOE knockout (KO) increased compliance of regenerated aortas and reduced extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition in adventitia of the regenerated aortas. Using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), a subset of profibrotic macrophages was found to be involved in graft fibrosis and APOE KO limited the formation of profibrotic macrophage formation during vascular regeneration. The interaction between APOE and low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein 1 (LRP1) partially mediated fibrotic differentiation of the macrophages. Profibrotic macrophages promoted graft fibrosis mainly through secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) that could support proliferation of fibroblasts. Finally, we showed that APOE knockdown in vivo using adeno-associated virus (AAV) improved the compliance of regenerated aortas and reduced ECM deposited in the adventitial areas by limiting formation of profibrotic macrophages. Collectively, these data indicate that APOE promotes the profibrotic transition of macrophages partially through LRP1, and the profibrotic macrophages increase the proliferation of fibroblasts via IGF-1.

Using a microfluidic device mimicking physiological flow rates and gradual capillary narrowing, we showed that compression through narrow channels lead to cell and nuclear deformation, rapid changes in chromatin state and increased calcium handling through the mechanosensor PIEZO1. Within minutes of microcapillary transit, cells show increased regulation of transcripts associated with metabolic reprogramming and meta-static processes, which culminates in the adoption of cancer stem cell-like properties. Squeezed cells displayed elevated melanoma stem cell markers, increased propensity for trans-endothelium invasion, and characteristics of enhanced tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Pharmacological disruption of channel activity inhibited the stem cell-like state, while the selective PIEZO1 activator Yoda1 primed this state irrespective of constriction. Finally, deletion of PIEZO1 led to complete abrogation of the constriction-induced stem cell-like state. Together, this work demonstrates that compressive forces during circulation can reprogram circulating cancer cells to tumorigenic stem cell-like states that are primed for extravasation and metastatic colonization.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Transcriptomic analysis identified 68,062 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under salt stress. Upregulated genes were found significantly enriched in pathways related to methionine, melatonin, and suberin biosynthesis-processes likely contributing to stress adaptation through root growth suppression and maintenance of ion homeostasis. In contrast, genes associated with gibberellin biosynthesis, abscisic acid (ABA) response, and sugar signaling were downregulated, indicating complex hormonal and metabolic reprogramming. Notably, paradoxical regulation of gibberellin and ethylene signaling pathways suggests the presence of finely tuned mechanisms that balance growth and stress responses.

C.", "abstract": "Characterizing how behavior must be tuned to produce useful coordination is key to understanding the evolution and regulation of collective behavior. While computational models can answer this question for specific instances, recurring patterns in model dynamics hint at a more general means of classifying collective dynamics. Using ant foraging models as a foundational example, we investigate mechanisms that can produce symmetry-breaking transitions to bistability as a first basic classification of collective behavior. Collective transitions are functionally important: They lead to sudden changes in collective states, enhanced sensitivity to environmental inputs, and hysteresis. We use bifurcation theory to argue that the point at which discontinuous transitions merge at a continuous transition forms a codimension-2 bifurcation with universal properties, and that this point is functionally equivalent to the critical point of a phase diagram. We show how analogous bistable transitions appear across models of ant foraging with different mechanistic assumptions, and we explore how biologically relevant collective effects play out near the transition. This framework clarifies the difficulty of tuning collective behavior: locating a continuous transition typically requires tuning two parameters, while a discontinuous transition requires tuning only one. Finally, we explore conditions that degrade or destroy bistable transitions: heterogeneity blurs the transitions, while recruitment mechanisms that do not create a positive feedback loop do not display bistability at all.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Among the various therapeutic strategies explored, cell transplantation, using either stem or differentiated cells, has been extensively studied. One of the most promising approaches involves the use of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), which have demonstrated unique potential to promote functional recovery and tissue repair following SCI. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how OEC transplantation modulates endogenous spinal stem cells, with a particular focus on ependymal cells. Using inducible transgenic mouse lines and fate-mapping approaches, we show that OEC transplantation significantly enhances ependymal cell proliferation and self-renewal both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, OECs promote astrocytic differentiation of ependymal progeny, which express low levels of inhibitory molecules, suggesting a supportive role in creating a permissive scar microenvironment. Transcriptomic analyses further revealed that OEC transplantation downregulates genes associated with axonal growth inhibition, thereby contributing to improved neuronal survival. Finally, by using a unique transgenic mouse model in which ependymal cell proliferation is genetically blocked, we demonstrate that the beneficial effects of OEC transplantation depend on ependymal cell activation. Together, these findings establish ependymal cells as essential mediators of the regenerative response induced by OECs. They also highlight a therapeutic strategy based on activating and modulating endogenous stem cells via the transient presence of non-integrating transplanted glial cells.

IPF is characterized by lung scarring, an elevated senescence burden, and interstitial pneumonia, resulting in disability and mortality. The growing aging population worldwide, limited effectiveness of current treatments, and high economic burden underscore the need for robust models to investigate the underlying mechanisms and test novel interventions. Despite broad preclinical use, the bleomycin-induced murine model has notable limitations. Animals subjected to a single dose of bleomycin administration undergo recovery in weight and behavior between 21 and 28 days after administration, which is contrary to the progressive nature of IPF. Previous reports have shown that repetitive instillation of bleomycin phenocopies this aspect of the human disease. However, these methods are time-consuming and complex. Although IPF is typically associated with advanced age, most research is conducted in 6 to 8-week-old mice, which lack the age-related structural and metabolic deficits seen in humans. In this study, we report an improved model of IPF using 17-month-old UM-HET3 mice subjected to a single oropharyngeal bleomycin dosing that better mimics the persistent nature of the disease. Lung histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) confirm persistence of fibrosis and senescence in mice 10 weeks after bleomycin administration. Furthermore, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis revealed a distinct set of gene expression signatures that is more consistent with chronic human fibrosis. This model offers greater insight into IPF pathogenesis, and we anticipate that it will enhance confidence in the human translatability of candidate therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Although piRNAs have been studied in golden hamsters and other representative mammals, little is known about the relationship between distinct piRNA populations and their regulatory effects on TEs in human oocytes. In this study, we simultaneously profiled small and long RNA transcriptomes in individual human oocytes across four developmental stages. piRNAs, especially PIWIL3-associated short piRNAs (short-piRNAs), are the predominant small non-coding RNAs during human oogenesis. A marked increase in short-piRNAs after the primordial follicle stage coincided with a global downregulation of TE expression, particularly LINE-1 (L1) and endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). On the other hand, PIWIL1- and PIWIL2-associated long piRNAs (long-piRNAs) were correlated with the silencing of certain specific ERV subfamilies. Genomic-context analyses revealed that highly productive piRNA clusters have evolved asymmetric antisense insertion bias toward L1 and ERVs, contributing to TE families-specific regulation. Our findings highlight the global effect of piRNA-mediated TEs repression, with short-piRNAs acting as the primary and broad-spectrum suppressors, and long-piRNAs providing coordinated ERV-specific silencing.

In this work, we investigated the dynamic retinal pathology of glaucoma from onset to late stages through longitudinal in vivo high-resolution imaging in a silicone oil-induced ocular hypertension glaucoma mouse model. We developed an optimized adaptive optics two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy (AO-TPEFM) technique for both morphological and functional assessments of pathological changes in the retina across three distinct glaucoma phenotypes with varying progression rates. Our AO-TPEFM technology visualized the complete process of functional and structural changes in the three most important retinal components related to glaucoma: microvascular vessels, microglia, and RGCs during disease progression.

However, most of our mechanistic understanding of these processes comes from the eukaryotic nucleosome, where highly basic histones, along with their flexible tails, coordinate DNA compaction and gene accessibility. Large DNA viruses challenge this paradigm by assembling nucleosome-like particles with a divergent histone architecture. These viral assemblies lack canonical histone tails, contain covalently fused domains linked by structured connectors, and exhibit altered surface electrostatics, features that collectively impose unique biophysical properties on viral chromatin. Here, we use multi-microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to dissect how histone fusion, tail loss, and connector architecture reshape the structural and thermodynamic behavior of the Melbournevirus nucleosome, a model system for studying viral chromatin organization. We find that viral systems exhibit elevated DNA unwrapping, weaker and more transient histone-DNA contacts, and localized flexibility at connector regions. Conformational adaptation at histone junctions partially offsets these effects, with structural shifts tuned to local DNA geometry during wrapping transitions. By capturing how nucleosome dynamics shift across time and sequence, our study reveals how conserved biophysical principles of chromatin architecture are reconfigured across life to meet distinct evolutionary demands.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Plant Cysteine Oxidases (PCOs) control this step by catalysing the oxidation of an N-terminal Cys residue exposed by ERFVIIs. In the present study, we investigated the functional impact of replacing Arabidopsis PCOs with diverse N-terminal cysteine oxidases (NCOs) from across the three eukaryotic kingdoms, hypothesizing that structural and kinetic differences may influence gene regulation of ERFVII targets under hypoxia and thus impact stress tolerance. Combining structural analyses, in vitro biochemical characterisation and in planta complementation assays we observed that not all tested NCOs are functionally equivalent to the endogenous PCOs. In fact, despite the remarkable conservation of catalytic motifs, we identified key differences in enzyme architecture that appear to affect the enzyme's capacity to regulate hypoxia responses in plants. Notably, NCO efficiency in oxidising ERFVII peptides inversely correlated with hypoxic gene expression under aerobic conditions and enhanced submergence survival, suggesting that partial ERFVII stabilization primes plants to cope with hypoxia. However, enhanced basal expression of hypoxia-responsive genes in turn correlated negatively with development and biomass accumulation, pointing to a trade-off between growth and stress resilience. Our findings demonstrate that tuning NCO activity can reshape the transcriptional and physiological hypoxia response, suggesting it is possible to enhance plant resilience under fluctuating oxygen conditions through enzyme engineering and precision breeding.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Plants have no CDC25, and thus their mechanisms of cell cycle regulation remain elusive1,5,6. Here, we show that the BSL1 phosphatase dephosphorylates CDKB1 to promote mitotic entry in Chlamydomonas. Mutations of BSL1 or CDKB1 block mitotic entry after DNA replication. BSL1 shows dynamic localization through the cell cycle at the basal bodies, spindle poles, and cleavage furrow. CDKB1 is hyperphosphorylated at T14 and Y15 residues in the bsl1 mutant and in wild-type cells treated with DNA replication inhibitors. BSL1 binds to CDKB1 and dephosphorylates CDKB1 pT14/pY15 in vitro. Phospho-mimicking mutations of T14/Y15 inactivate CDKB1 function, whereas phospho-blocking mutations cause sensitivity to DNA replication inhibitors, which delay cytokinesis in wild-type cells more than cells expressing unphosphorylatable mutant CDKB1. These results indicate that CDKB1 T14/Y15 is phosphorylated to block mitotic entry before DNA replication is complete, and BSL1 dephosphorylates CDKB1 to promote mitosis.

PCO-catalysed dioxygenation of the N-terminal Cys of substrates, including Group VII Ethylene Response Factors (ERVIIs), targets them for degradation via the Cys/Arg N-degron pathway, however these substrates are stabilized in hypoxia due to reduced PCO activity. When plants are flooded, submergence-induced hypoxia results in ERFVII-mediated upregulation of hypoxia responsive genes that reconfigure plant metabolism and allow short-term resilience to the conditions. However, the increasing frequency and duration of flood events requires strategies to improve plant flood resilience, particularly amongst agronomic crops. One possibility is to prolong the stability of ERFVIIs by engineering the PCOs to catalyse their oxidation less efficiently. We report a structure-guided kinetic and biophysical investigation of Arabidopsis thaliana PCO4 that reveals residues important for substrate-binding and catalysis. We subsequently selected AtPCO4 variants Y183F and C173A, with severe and mild impacts on AtPCO4 activity, respectively, to complement Arabidopsis pco1pco2pco4pco5 plants and investigate their impact on submergence resilience.

Approximate string matching (ASM) is the problem of finding all occurrences of a pattern P in a text T while allowing up to k errors. ASM was researched extensively around the 1990s, but with the rise of large-scale datasets, focus shifted towards inexact approaches based on seed-chain-extend. These methods often provide large speedups in practice, but do not guarantee finding all matches with [&le;]k errors. However, many applications, such as CRISPR off-target detection, require exhaustive results with no false negatives. Methods. We introduce Sassy, a library and tool for ASM of short (up to {approx}1000 bp) patterns in large texts. Sassy builds on earlier tools that use Myers' bitpacking, such as Edlib. Algorithmically, the two main novelties are to split each sequence into 4 parts that are searched in parallel, and to use bitvectors in the text direction (horizontally) rather than the pattern direction (vertically). This allows significant speedups for short queries, especially when k is small, as has complexity O(k{lceil}n/W{rciel}) when searching random text, where W = 256 is the SIMD width. Practically speaking, Sassy is the only recent index-free tool that is designed specifically for ASM, rather than the more common semi global alignment. In addition, Sassy supports the IUPAC alphabet, which is essential for primer design and for matching ambiguous bases in assemblies. Separately, we also introduce the concept of overhang cost: a variant of 'overlap' alignment where e.g. a suffix of the pattern is matched against a prefix of the text, where each character of the pattern that extends beyond the text incurs a cost of e.g.  = 0.5. This is important when matches are near contig or read ends. Results. Compared to Edlib, Sassy is 4x to 15x faster for sequences up to length 1000, and has throughputs exceeding 2 GB/s, whereas Edlib remains below 130 MB/s. Likewise, Sassy is up to 10x faster than parasail when searching short strings. Sassy is also readily applicable to biological problems such as CRISPR off-target detection. When searching 61 guide sequences in a human genome, Sassy is 100x faster than SWOffinder and only slightly slower (for k [&le;]3) than CHOPOFF, for which building its index takes 20 minutes. Sassy also scales well to larger k [isin]{4, 5}, unlike CHOPOFF whose index took over 10 hours to build. Availibility.

The molecular changes during initiation and establishment of symbiosis are of great interest, but quantitatively monitoring such changes can be challenging, particularly when the microorganisms differ greatly in size or are intimately associated. Here, we analyze output from data-dependent acquisition (DDA) LC-MS/MS proteomics experiments investigating the well-studied interaction between the alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the heterotrophic bacterium Mesorhizobium japonicum. We found that detection of bacterial proteins decreased in coculture by 50% proteome-wide due to the abundance of algal proteins. As a result, standard differential expression analysis led to numerous false-positive reports of significantly downregulated proteins, where it was not possible to distinguish meaningful biological responses to symbiosis from artifacts of the reduced protein detection in coculture relative to monoculture. We show that data normalization alone does not eliminate the impact of altered detection on differential expression analysis of the cross-kingdom symbiosis. We assessed two additional strategies to overcome this methodological artifact inherent to DDA proteomics. In the first, we combined algal and bacterial monocultures at a relative abundance that mimicked the coculture, creating a ''mono-mix'' control to which the coculture could be compared. This approach enabled comparable detection of bacterial proteins in the coculture and the monoculture control. In the second strategy, we enhanced detection of lowly abundant bacterial proteins by using sample fractionation upstream of LC-MS/MS analysis. When these simple approaches were combined, they allowed for meaningful comparisons of nearly 10,000 algal proteins and over 4,000 bacterial proteins in response to symbiosis by DDA. They successfully recovered expected changes in the bacterial proteome in response to algal coculture, including upregulation of sugar-binding proteins and transporters. They also revealed novel proteomic responses to coculture that guide hypotheses about algal-bacterial interactions.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

A.; Taormina, M. B.; Holden, W. M.; Ostroumov, A.", "abstract": "Identifying shared neural mechanisms influenced by diverse classes of drugs of abuse is essential for understanding addiction and for developing broad-spectrum treatments for substance use disorders. Previous studies indicate that many drugs of abuse increase dopamine output from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) by altering the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs onto dopamine neurons, thereby promoting maladaptive plasticity within reward circuits. Here, we demonstrate in rats that acute injections of morphine and cocaine, but not saline, disrupt chloride homeostasis in VTA GABA neurons. This disruption is characterized by a depolarized GABAA reversal potential, impaired chloride extrusion, and posttranslational downregulation of the potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2. Although previous studies linked drug-induced posttranslational downregulation of KCC2 in the VTA to glucocorticoid receptor activation, we found that a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist did not prevent cocaine- and morphine-induced disruption of chloride homeostasis. Instead, our data show that dopamine receptor activation is both necessary and sufficient for these alterations. Notably, chloride homeostasis remains impaired 30 days after volitional morphine self-administration, indicating long-lasting plasticity. These findings complement previous work on nicotine and alcohol, suggesting a shared mechanism of inhibitory plasticity in the VTA following drug exposure. Given that chloride dysregulation in VTA GABA neurons influences downstream circuit function and promotes maladaptive behaviors associated with drug use, we propose KCC2 as a promising therapeutic target for substance use disorders.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Retinal edema typically results from dysfunction of the blood-retina barrier (BRB), which is associated with increased retinal expression of complement components. It is unclear whether the classical complement pathway has detrimental or protective roles in the context of BRB dysfunction. Here, we characterize Tspan12 KODBM (Disrupted Barrier Maintenance) mice, a new mouse model of cystoid edema based on genetically and pharmacologically manipulating beta-catenin-dependent norrin/frizzled4 (FZD4) signaling. We assess BRB function, cystoid edema, ERG, and microglia activation outcomes in an aging study with WT, C1qa KO, Tspan12 KODBM, and Tspan12 KODBM; C1qa KO compound mutant mice. Phenotypic analyses and cell-based experiments indicate that C1QA contributes to maintaining basal beta-catenin-dependent signaling and that the absence of C1QA exacerbates BRB dysfunction, cystoid edema, and neuroinflammation in Tspan12 KODBM; C1qa compound mutant mice. Activation of beta-catenin-dependent signaling by a FZD4/LRP5 agonist antibody modality achieves complete resolution of cystoid edema. This study shows that reducing or enhancing norrin/frizzled4 signaling can increase or decrease cystoid edema, respectively, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target in ME. Furthermore, this study provides novel insights into the contribution of C1QA to BRB maintenance.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

The neural substrate underlying such intermanual/interlimb generalization of newly acquired skill memory is unclear. Here, we focused on contralateral primary motor cortex (cM1) which is considered a key brain area for skill learning and memory consolidation. We probed the causal role of cM1 in intermanual skill generalization in a two-day study involving right-handed young individuals (n=31) who learned a novel motor skill reaching task. Immediately following (right-arm) learning, we delivered low-frequency (1Hz, 1800 pulses) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to target left cM1 in one group of individuals (n=15), while another group (n=16) served as an active control in which ipsilateral M1 (iM1) was targeted. On the same day we measured corticospinal excitability (CSE) to assess learning-induced and rTMS-induced neuroplastic changes occurring in the targeted M1s. Next day after 24-hours, both groups were tested for intermanual skill generalization (left-arm), followed by a brief test of intralimb retention (right-arm). Our results show that stimulating cM1, versus iM1, reduced the amount of generalization to the untrained arm on the next day, without affecting its (re)learning ability or the follow-up retention performance of the trained arm. Further, rTMS stimulation induced a net facilitation in CSE- with higher facilitation tending to correlate to lower generalization in a subset of high learners in cM1 group. Taken together, this study highlights the role of cM1 in skill generalization such that it seems to mediate the early transfer of learning to the untrained arm.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Despite the diversity of cortical regions and thereby supported tasks, we identify two fundamental computations that explain neural activity across visual cortex: object and appearance-free motion recognition. Strikingly, a single objective underlies both: these inherent computations in the brain emerge from optimising for understanding world dynamics, and their arrangement is highly distributed and smooth across cortex rather than strictly aligning with the two visual streams. Our results suggest that the human brain's ability to integrate complex information across seemingly distinct representational pathways may originate from the single goal of modelling the world.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

However, RePair's memory usage scales poorly with input size, as it loads the entire text into memory. In contrast, Relative Lempel-Ziv (RLZ) parsing offers a scalable and lightweight online encoding scheme that losslessly represents a text in terms of phrases that refer to a reference string, but it often fails to expose deeper structural patterns. We introduce an algorithm that produces a RePair grammar from the RLZ parse of the input, leveraging the strengths of both methods. Our method, RLZ-RePair, performs bigram replacements systematically, preserving the integrity of the RLZ phrases throughout the RePair iterations. When the reference is well chosen, our method achieves the same grammar as standard RePair while significantly reducing both memory usage and the number of bigram replacements. In particular, we show that RLZ-RePair uses significantly less memory than RePair, which required between 18% and 480% more memory across different data sets. To our knowledge, RLZ-RePair is one of the first scalable methods that constructs exact RePair grammars, resulting in a grammar-based compressor that is both practical for large datasets and faithful to the theoretical elegance of RePair.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

A classic example is ascorbate (Vitamin C), which is synthesized in most animals by L-Gulonolactone Oxidase (GULO), an enzyme lost multiple independent times in animal evolution. This event is thought to be evolutionarily neutral, however, GULO-deficient animals including humans need to obtain ascorbate from their diet and are susceptible to ascorbate deficiency and scurvy. We therefore hypothesized that this disadvantage of GULO loss is offset by physiological benefits. Here we show that ascorbate deficiency protects mice from schistosomiasis, a debilitating parasitic disease which afflicts 250 million people. Schistosoma mansoni worms required host ascorbate to produce eggs in vivo. Consequently, ascorbate-deficient mice were protected from schistosomiasis pathologies and transmission. Intermittent ascorbate deficiency protected Gulo-deficient mice from both scurvy and schistosomiasis mortality. The effects of ascorbate on schistosome reproduction were mediated by ascorbate-dependent histone demethylation which promoted vitellocyte development in female schistosomes. We propose that vitamin deficiencies are not always detrimental but can protect animals from pathogens which need to obtain vitamins from their host.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

However, conventional human paradigms often fail to capture the dynamic interplay between hunger, satiety, and cue-induced behavioral actions. To address this, we built a novel automated dispenser synchronized with task events and integrated into an adapted human Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT) paradigm to deliver real, consumable food rewards in real time, allowing participants to eat online and thereby induce satiation or sustain hunger. In one experiment, we manipulated food rewards by varying portion size and consumption timing. Large portions consumed immediately induced rapid satiation, whereas small, trial-by-trial portions kept participants non-satiated; correspondingly, large portions accelerated devaluation of the food reward, evidenced by a pronounced decline in instrumental responding, while small portions sustained cue-driven behavior over time. In a subsequent experiment, small, immediately consumed food rewards (which kept participants non-satiated) were directly compared with real-time monetary rewards. Although both reward types initially invigorated behavior, the motivational impact of monetary rewards declined quicker, suggesting that the absence of physiological feedback renders secondary reinforcers more vulnerable to rapid devaluation. These findings suggest that satiety accelerates, rather than abolishes, the influence of food-associated cues. The distinct temporal dynamics observed for food and monetary outcomes underscore the importance of real-time ingestion in human PIT paradigms, offering new insights into the mechanisms by which physiological states modulate cue-driven devaluation.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Whereas both single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variants (CNVs) can alter gene dosage, it remains unclear whether CNVs confer unique adaptive advantages. Here, we show that CNVs do not mediate adaptive tracking in fluctuating environments, but instead act as reversible toggles between ecological strategies. Using a dual-fluorescent CNV reporter system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we tracked CNV dynamics at two transporter loci during long-term evolution under static and fluctuating nitrogen limitation. CNVs arose with high repeatability in static conditions but showed dampened or divergent dynamics in fluctuating environments, suggesting they do not track environmental change. Instead, we found that the ratio of copy number between the two loci, but not copy number at either locus alone, predicted ecological strategy: imbalanced CNV ratios defined specialists, while balanced ratios defined generalists. Evolution in static environments favored specialists whereas fluctuating environments favored generalists. Applying this framework to over 3,000 sequenced yeast genomes, we found generalist CNV signatures in both wild and domesticated strains, but specialist signatures exclusively in domesticated strains. These findings introduce a generalizable framework for predicting ecological strategy from genome structure, positioning CNV ratios as a molecular signature of niche breadth across evolutionary and ecological contexts.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Here, we constructed a draft genome assembly for the low-dispersing marine dogwhelk, Nucella canaliculata, and studied patterns of genomic diversity and shell morphometrics in 19 populations distributed along ~1,500 km of the west coast of North America. We observed significant population structure with a strong phylogeographic break at Monterey Bay, which was matched with divergence in shell morphology. Genomic patterns, concomitant with computer simulations, suggest that there were at least two refugial populations during the last glacial maximum that subsequently experienced post-glacial expansion and admixture. Furthermore, by linking genotype to phenotype, we identified candidate loci associated with the molecular bases of variation in shell morphology.

Combining phylogenomics with multi-scale genomic analysis and modeling, we provide evidence for group behavior, whereby ISs collectively contribute to the construction of their own niche, whose spread is found to be limited within chromosomes. Niches are shared with other mobile genetic elements and exhibit spatial partitioning reminiscent of ecological niche differentiation.

While most studies compare immune states before and after treatment, temporal immune changes during therapy remain largely uncharacterized, limiting development of effective combination strategies. Here, we investigated immune dynamics throughout targeted therapy using mouse melanoma models that recapitulate human therapeutic responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) identified a previously unrecognized inflection point where the inflamed TME during tumor regression, characterized by robust NK cell infiltration, transitions to an immune-excluded state upon onset of drug-tolerant residual disease. We uncovered a unique macrophage subset (F4/80hiCCL5+MHCII+CD63+) that orchestrates NK cell recruitment through CCR2/5 signaling during regression. Depletion of these macrophages using LysM-cre;iDTR mice significantly reduced NK cell infiltration. Specifically during residual disease, pharmacological inhibition of Ptpn22, a phosphatase that negatively regulates immune activation, reprogrammed macrophages, restored NK cell recruitment and enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Extending these findings to human cancer, longitudinal scRNA-seq analysis of melanoma and lung cancer patient samples revealed dynamic NK cell infiltration during targeted therapy, establishing a direct link between innate immune remodeling and treatment outcome. Unlike prior prognostic studies assessing immune states at single time points, our results provide mechanistic evidence of a temporal relationship between NK cell infiltration and therapeutic efficacy. Together, these findings position immune evolution as a driver of acquired resistance and identify macrophage-NK cell crosstalk as a therapeutically actionable axis to overcome immune exclusion and improve targeted therapy across multiple cancer types.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

In addition to frequent genetic mutations, malignant plasma cells are characterized by alterations to the epigenome. Myeloma cells display a genome-wide loss of DNA methylation and a corresponding increase in active chromatin modifications. The dramatic epigenetic remodeling that occurs in cancer genomes is associated with loss of silencing at transposable elements, which can impact genome regulation. Through paired epigenome and transcriptome profiling of patient derived MM samples, we have found that loss of DNA methylation in MM genomes results in the formation of partially methylated domains that are variable across patients. This loss of DNA methylation coincides with the expression of hundreds of transcripts driven by LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons that are epigenetically silenced in normal cells. MM samples can be stratified based on L1 activity with distinct gene expression signatures. The high L1 samples are characterized by a more proliferative, less differentiated state as well as inhibition of interferon and genome defense pathways. Several L1 promoters generate chimeric transcripts with adjacent oncogenes. We further find that KRAB-zinc finger proteins (KZFPs) that are responsible for the epigenetic silencing of L1s have abnormally low abundance in MM samples with high L1 activity.

This algorithm utilizes biologically-inspired operators and is grounded in theoretical results on Pareto optimality for mixed discrete-continuous spaces. In computational experiments on synthetic benchmarks, our approach showed superior performance, attaining the lowest mean squared error in three of four test cases against single objective and topology-fixed methods. The framework successfully discovers multiple functionally equivalent network configurations, a finding that highlights the degeneracy inherent in biological systems and offers practical insights for synthetic biology, where function is often prioritized over precise structural accuracy.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

The extent to which neural affect decoding is resilient against or vulnerable to extreme noise-masking of voice signals remains largely unknown. Here, we performed three experiments using an auditory bubble technique to randomly mask and unmask certain spectrotemporal voice features similar to natural noise masking. First, using psychoacoustic voice-in-noise testing, we observed that a substantial part of the full spectrotemporal space of voice signals contains diagnostic cues essential for accurate affect decoding, contributing to the partial robustness of the voice signals under noise masking. Affective voice signals (joy, aggression) were correctly identified from early broadband spectral and temporally extended high-frequency information. Neutral voices were primarily identified from low- to medium-level spectral information with high perceptual relevance near the voice offset. Second, using human neuroimaging, we mechanistically linked neural activity to minimal spectrotemporal patches that enable accurate affect classification from voice samples. A neural network composed of (sub-)cortical auditory and limbic nodes, fronto-insular regions, and vocal motor mirroring nodes supported the affective discrimination of voice signals. More specifically, activity in the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala was mechanistically linked to correct affect decisions, as determined by a reverse brain-to-decision mapping approach. Thus, decoding affect from voice signals embedded in complex noise seems partially feasible, provided that the noise does not obscure the minimal diagnostic spectrotemporal information essential for engaging cortical and subcortical limbic affect decoding mechanisms.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

In mice, itaconate, produced in macrophages by ACOD1 mediated decarboxylation of aconitate, has direct antimicrobial activity, modulates inflammatory cytokines, and is required for resistance to M. tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. The role of itaconate in human macrophages is less clear and whether itaconate mediates distinct effects in macrophage subtypes is unknown. Here, we investigated the role of itaconate in a human iPSC-derived macrophages, either induced by GM-CSF to resemble alveolar macrophages (AM-Like cells), or treated with M-CSF to generate control macrophages (MCDM cells). Both types of human macrophages produce substantially less itaconate than mouse macrophages and AM-Ls produced 4-fold less itaconate than MCDMs. Surprisingly, ACOD1 deficient AM-L macrophages, but not MCDM macs, were permissive for Mtb growth. Moreover, itaconate functioned to dampen the Mtb induced inflammatory response in MCDMs, but not AM-L macrophages, affecting both the Type I IFN and TNF pathways. These results indicate that itaconate is involved in human macrophage responses to TB, with distinct roles in different macrophage subsets. These results also show that genetically tractable hiPSC-derived macrophages are a robust and versatile model to dissect cellular host pathogen interactions.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

This observation led to the longstanding hypothesis that the distinctive palate arrangement of palaeognaths retains the ancestral crown bird condition, but recent fossil evidence instead suggests that aspects of palaeognath palate morphology are derived from a neognath-like ancestral condition. While neoteny has been hypothesised as a mechanism underpinning the distinctive palatal morphologies of palaeognaths, this hypothesis has never been tested with a broad phylogenetic assessment of morphological variation through avian palate ontogeny. Here, we quantitatively assess morphological variation of the palate through the post-hatching ontogenies of 70 bird species representing all major extant phylogenetic subclades, clarifying the ontogenetic mechanisms giving rise to avian palate disparity. Though palaeognaths exhibit distinct ontogenetic changes in the PPC relative to neognaths, we find no signatures of heterochrony, including neoteny, underlying these developmental differences. However, important patterns of morphological change in the avian palate appear to be dictated by variation in developmental mode.

B.", "abstract": "Cellular coinfection between multiple virions is a common feature of viral infections. The collective virus-virus interactions enabled by these coinfections can influence the fitness of viral populations and give rise to novel infection phenotypes. Multi-strain coinfections allow viral resources to be shared between multiple individuals, and enable genetic combination and recombination between genotypes, potentially giving rise to hybrid progeny with enhanced fitness. However, coinfection can also impose fitness costs in certain situations. For example, resource sharing among viruses can lead to the persistence of low-fitness genotypes, and reassortment between different strains can lead to negative inter-segment epistasis when genes are poorly matched to one another. Thus, the fitness implications of cellular coinfection are poorly defined and likely context dependent. To investigate the specific conditions that lead to positive or negative fitness consequences for multi-strain coinfections, we formulated a model in which different genotypes of a three-segment virus replicate under varying degrees of inter-strain mixing. We observed that increased mixing had negative fitness consequences under a variety of scenarios, and that this effect was exacerbated with increasing genetic divergence between strains. Inter-strain mixing only enhanced viral fitness (a) when positive genetic dominance interactions were at play, and (b) under very specific conditions of selective pressure. We also observed that reassortment arising from mixing could generate hybrid genotypes with higher fitness than either parental virus, but that these outcomes were relatively rare. Overall, using a model segmented virus, we found that the heterologous coinfection was deleterious under most conditions, suggesting that it may be beneficial for many viruses to limit the extent of cellular coinfection.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Globodera pallida poses a major threat to potato production, with management strategies primarily relying on genetic resistance. However, reports from multiple locations in Western Europe indicate a steady increase in virulence levels among field populations, raising major concerns about G. pallida control. The evolutionary mechanisms driving this rise in virulence are poorly understood. To investigate this, we analysed the propagation of thirteen recently isolated field populations on thirty commercial potato varieties over four independent PCN resistance tests. Our findings indicate that (1) the genetic basis of resistance in potatoes is small, with the major resistance conferred by GpaV from Solanum vernei, and (2) the wide application of GpaVvrn has led to continuous selection on standing genetic variation in G. pallida field populations. To map virulence, we propagated two field populations on a GpaVvrn-resistant variety for four consecutive generations. High-coverage whole-genome sequencing of each generation revealed that GpaVvrn-mediated selection acted on a single locus of a newly assembled G. pallida Rookmaker reference genome. Examination of this virulence-associated locus identified Gp-pat-1 as a candidate gene. Silencing Gp-pat-1 increased G. pallida virulence on a GpaVvrn-resistant potato variety but had no effect on nematode virulence on a susceptible variety. Thereby classifying Gp-pat-1 as an avirulence gene and confirming its role in the breakdown of GpaVvrn-resistance. These findings demonstrate that negative selection on the Gp-pat-1 avirulence allele by GpaVvrn-mediated resistance is driving the emergence of virulence in the G. pallida field populations used in our selection experiments. Our results therefore strongly suggest that selection on Gp-pat-1 is likely underlying the current outbreak of GpaVvrn-resistance breaking populations. Our results provide a foundation for the development of molecular diagnostic tools to monitor virulence in field populations, to enhance understanding of resistance breakdown, and to inform the sustainable deployment of resistances in the field.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

We generated a haplotype-phased reference genome assembly and revealed a >3500% increase in somatic embryo mutation rates compared to field-grown trees, along with a distinct mutation spectrum. The assembly also helped reveal extreme genomic instability in the somatic embryos, including multiple chromosomal duplications, megabase-scale deletions, telomere expansions, somatic recombination events, and ongoing transposable element activation. Our survey of somatic mutation also provides high-resolution insight into clonal stem cell dynamics, confirming the canonical meristem layers of flowering plants in the tree and shoot clones, while uncovering clear evidence of frequent single-cell bottlenecks in the somatic embryos.

The tumour microenvironment critically shapes ICI responsiveness by modulating antitumour immunity, necessitating a deeper understanding of spatially organised cell-cell interactions. Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables such analysis at single-cell resolution. We present GraphTME, a spatially informed and biologically interpretable framework that models pathway-specific directional cell-cell interactions to predict anti-PD-1 response. Ligand-receptor interactions are organised by signalling pathways and represented as a multi-relational directed graph, with edge weights inversely scaled by spatial distance. Using CD8+ T cells from single-cell RNA-seq data of ICI-treated NSCLC patients, we trained a relational graph convolutional network to infer immune responsiveness. GraphTME achieved an F1 score exceeding 0.83 in predicting ICI response and was validated using MERFISH data from an NSCLC patient with a partial response. Predicted responder CD8+ T cells exhibited higher abundance and stronger directional signalling to tumour cells. They also expressed genes associated with antitumour activity, while non-responders showed expression patterns linked to poor prognosis. GraphTME is the first framework to quantitatively model single-cell-level interactions within the spatial architecture of tumour tissues and predict ICI responses from these interactions.

It is well established that in obesity, the distribution and not just amount of excess white adipose tissue (WAT) correlates with a persons risk for comorbidities such as coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Thus, understanding the specific mechanisms that drive WAT development in specific adipose depots could elucidate novel mechanisms of metabolic disease. SNPs near the gene CEBPA have been associated with multiple cardiometabolic traits by human genome-wide association studies, including waist-to-hip ratio, suggesting that CEBPA regulates WAT distribution. CEBPA encodes a well characterized transcription factor (C/EBP) that is long recognized as a master regulator of adipocyte differentiation, yet depot-specific roles for C/EBP have not been previously described. To further investigate this genetic link, we generated mice with adipocyte-specific Cebpa knockout (Cebpa_ASKO) and found that these mice are almost entirely lacking gonadal WAT (gWAT) despite the inguinal WAT (iWAT) being present in near normal amounts. Despite developing, Cebpa_ASKO iWAT contains fewer and larger adipocytes, and fails to expand when challenged with high fat diet. RNA-seq and functional studies demonstrate evidence of altered lipid metabolism and adipocyte function in Cebpa_ASKO iWAT. Finally, Cebpa_ASKO mice have multiple other metabolic phenotypes, including lipid-laden BAT, increased hepatic triglycerides, and increased plasma cholesterol, all of which worsen with prolonged high fat diet feeding.

As a proof-of-concept, we tested MOTUM during a reach-to-grasp task with and without visual feedback of one's hand (N = 7). The system achieved high-fidelity motion tracking, induced an intense immersive experience, evoked expected sensorimotor brain activations, and maintained high fMRI data quality. Standard fMRI control metrics were below the critical threshold in 99% of volumes, indicating that participants' arm movements had minimal impact on head motion and data quality. While hand movements had little to no effect on brain activity, arm movements resulted in sparse spurious correlations that were easily controlled for. Critically, MOTUM allowed us to extract rich kinematic indices and link them directly to brain activity on a trial-by-trial basis. Parametric modulation analyses revealed that natural variations in movement dynamics significantly influenced neural responses in parietal, frontal, and occipital regions.

Our analysis of spatial gene expression revealed the molecular signatures influenced by PCB in these susceptible brain regions of mice. Network analysis suggests that these changes are associated with higher chlorinated PCBs present in the brain.

Compared to Foxp3 overexpressing Teff cells, induced Tregs from naive precursors, and endogenous Tregs, ER Tregs provide superior protection against autoimmune neuroinflammation. This enhanced efficacy stems from their inherited autoantigen specificity and selectively preserved effector cell transcriptional programs, which together bolster their fitness in inflammatory environments and enhance their suppressive capacity.

The molecular mechanisms that govern organ plasticity and drive recovery from pathological states are poorly defined. In this study, we mapped the transcriptional and regulatory landscape of human cardiac recovery using multiomic single-cell data from non-failing, failing, and recovered hearts after mechanical unloading. Macrophages emerged as the most dynamically reprogrammed cell type during recovery. Deep learning analysis of recovery-associated macrophage gene programs implicated the transcription factor RUNX1 as a key regulator. In a murine model of chronic heart failure, macrophage-specific deletion of Runx1 induced functional, structural, and molecular features of recovery observed in human hearts. Mechanistically, we used in vivo chromatin occupancy mapping in cardiac macrophages combined with targeted CRISPR perturbations to dissect the dynamic transcriptional regulation of Runx1 in disease through activation of a suite of regulatory elements. Runx1 deletion reprogrammed macrophages from a pro-inflammatory to a reparative state, suppressed fibrosis, and promoted cardiomyocyte adaption. RUNX1 chromatin profiling enabled the construction of a macrophage RUNX1-regulon whose activity diminished as the heart recovered in both mouse and human heart failure. Therapeutically, Runx1 inhibition using a small molecule facilitated cardiac recovery in vivo. Collectively, our findings uncover a druggable RUNX1 epigenetic mechanism whereby the innate immune system rewires the tissue microenvironment to orchestrate recovery of organ function.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

The disease is associated with inclusion body myopathy, early-onset Paget's disease of bone, frontotemporal dementia, and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There is currently no treatment for this progressive disease associated with early demise resulting from proximal limb girdle and respiratory muscle weakness. We hypothesize that regulating VCP hyperactivity to normal levels can reduce the disease pathology. In this study, we assessed the effect of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) specifically targeting the human VCP gene in the patient (R155H) iPSC-derived skeletal muscle progenitor cells (SMPCs). ASOs were well tolerated up to a concentration of 5 micromol, and significantly reduced VCP protein expression in the SMPCs by 48% (95% CI [39-56]). We also treated the transgenic mouse model of VCP disease with the overexpressed humanized VCP gene severe A232E pathogenic variant with weekly subcutaneous ASO injections starting from 6 months of age for 3 months. In the skeletal muscle of transgenic mice, ASOs resulted in 30% (95%CI [27-32]) knockdown of VCP protein compared to control ASO. The ASO-mediated reduction of VCP expression in muscle tissue was associated with improvement in autophagy flux and reduction in TDP-43 expression, hallmarks of VCP disease. In addition, ASO-treated VCP A232E mice showed improvements in functional tests of muscle strength, such as rotarod and inverted screen test compared to mice treated with control ASO. These results suggest that targeting VCP could be beneficial in preventing the progression of the VCP myopathy and hold promise for the treatment of patients with VCP MSP1.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the effects of prolonged HCD exposure to rats on lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and miRNA expression in a rat model. Male Wistar rats were fed either a standard diet or HCD for 30, 60, 90, or 120 days. Biochemical analyses revealed a progressive dyslipidemic profile characterized by elevated total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, VLDL, and atherogenic index, alongside a significant reduction in HDL. Lipid peroxidation levels increased markedly with HCD duration, while antioxidant markers PON1 and ApoA1 were significantly reduced and oxLDL levels were elevated. Inflammatory cytokines (CRP, TNF-, IL-6, IL-8) and VCAM-1 were significantly increased, indicating systemic inflammation and endothelial activation. Notably, miR-23a-5p and miR-15b-5p were elevated in the serum of HCD-fed rats, with miR-23a-5p peaking at day 120. Correlation analyses revealed that miR-23a-5p expression positively correlated with oxLDL and inversely with ApoA1 and PON1 levels, suggesting its involvement in oxidative and lipoprotein dysregulation. These findings demonstrate that prolonged HCD induces a coordinated cascade of oxidative, inflammatory, and lipoprotein alterations, with miR-23a-5p emerging as potential biomarkers and regulators of redox and lipid homeostasis in atherogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Known for its association with febrile illnesses and wide host range, JMTV has been detected in Rhipicephalus, Hyalomma, and Amblyomma ticks collected from cattle, goats, sheep, camels, and chickens in pastoral regions of Kenya, including Baringo, Mandera, Malindi, Lamu, Mombasa, Wajir, Isiolo, and West Pokot. Using viral metagenomics next-generation sequencing, this study analysed adult ticks (n=1547, 72 pools). A total of 53% (38/72) pools were positive for at least one viral pathogen, with JMTV detected in 87% (33/38) of these pools across all study sites. Phylogenetic analyses revealed evidence of distinct Kenyan JMTV strains, with sequence segments from Malindi and Wajir clustering uniquely in their own clade; suggesting potential localised evolutionary pressures. Time calibrated phylogeny for the segment 1(RdRp) suggested varied ancestral origins and evolutionary relationships for the JMTV strains. MEME, BUSTED and FUBAR methods implemented in the Data-Monkey, unanimously identified codon 290 in segment 1 and 30 in segment 4 to be undergoing episodic positive selection. Recombination analysis performed using the RDP4 recombination detection tool indicated a recombination event in segment 2 of the Lamu JMTV strain that was confirmed by seven detection methods and visualised in BootScan. These findings suggest that Kenyan JMTV strains are undergoing positive selection, potentially driven by unique ecological and host factors. Segmented genome evidence of recombination highlights the increasing viruss potential for antigenic diversity. Host diversity and virus phylogenetic patterns underscore the zoonotic potential and its capacity for regional spread, emphasizing the critical need for enhanced vector surveillance. Temporal and ecological drivers like seasonal tick activity and livestock movement warrant investigation to elucidate JMTV transmission dynamics. Prioritizing tick-borne virus surveillance in Kenya will strengthen public health strategies and mitigates emerging viral risks.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

A leading hypothesis suggests these differences are adaptive and driven by sex-specific life-history trade-offs, but formal theoretical support is lacking. To address this, we developed a mathematical model to investigate how such trade-offs shape lifespan evolution in a monogamous mating system. In the model, individuals evolve to optimise a trade-off between reproduction and survival -- mediated by mating opportunities in males and offspring production in females. By systematically varying trade-off strengths, we show that either sex can evolve greater longevity, but male-biased longevity evolves under a broader set of conditions -- consistent with patterns in monogamous species. This asymmetry arises because female longevity is more constrained: the trade-off between offspring production and survival directly affects the fertility of both sexes. In contrast, the male trade-off for mating opportunities has a weaker indirect effect on female fertility, allowing selection to more readily favour longer male lifespans. We also show that extrinsic density-dependent mortality can disproportionately affect the intrinsically longer-living sex, and obscure the magnitude of this evolved difference. Together, our results provide new theoretical insights into the adaptive bases of sex-biased longevity and highlight the importance of life-history trade-offs in shaping lifespan evolution.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

The steel tube functions as a mechanical resonator that inertially senses the buoyant mass of particles. For microgram-scale particles [&ge;]400 m in diameter, we achieve <1% precision error in buoyant mass with a 5-minute acquisition interval. By sequentially measuring the buoyant mass of individual, glioblastoma patient-derived tumor spheroids in media of different densities and cell permeabilities, we determine the absolute and fractional (v/v) water content of the spheroids, along with their dry mass, volume, and density properties. We achieve ~0.4% precision error in fractional water content with a throughput of 3 spheroids per hour. This enables us to detect both inter-spheroid variability in fractional water content and acute responses to kinase inhibition. Overall, we establish a simple and accessible technique for quantifying water content in living 3D cell culture models, opening new avenues for studying biophysical regulation in multicellular systems.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

The PULSE incorporates forward and sideward-looking miniaturized ultrasound transducers, integrated into either a 7-French catheter (cPULSE) or a 16-gauge needle (nPULSE), to minimally invasively sonicate a centimeter-sized tumor. Following the design, prototyping, and characterization of PULSE, its dual capability for intracellular and extracellular delivery is demonstrated through comprehensive in vitro cell-based sonoporation tests and phantom-based drug penetration tests. Luciferase assays (activity: ~104 RLU/g level) in the cell studies confirm significantly enhanced gene transfection with cPULSE, while increased dye diffusion (width: ~1 cm level) in the phantom tests validates improved perfusion with nPULSE.

A few statistical methods have been proposed to do so for phenotypes represented by discrete values. For continuous traits, no such statistical approach has been proposed, and researchers have resorted to sensible but uncharacterized criteria. Here, we investigate a phylogenetic model for coding sequences where amino acid preferences at a site are given by a continuous function of a quantitative trait. This function is inferred from the amino acids and the trait values in extant species and requires inferred point estimates of ancestral values of the trait at internal nodes. For detecting sites whose evolution is associated with this trait, we use a significance test against the hypothesis that amino acid preference does not depend on the trait. This procedure is compared to simpler strategies on simulated alignments. It displays an increased recall for low false positive rates, which is of special importance for performing whole-genome scans. This comes however at a much higher computational cost, and we suggest using a simple test to filter promising candidate sites. We then revisit a dataset of alignments for 62 species of mammals, using longevity as a phenotypic trait. We apply our method to three protein families that have previously been proposed to display sites associated with variation in lifespan in mammals. Using a graphical representation extracted from the detailed phylogenetic analysis of candidate sites, we suggest that the evidence for this in the sequence data alone is weak. The proposed method has been added to our Pelican software.

A.", "abstract": "The tumor suppressor p53 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression under cellular stress. Mutations in its DNA-binding domain are common in lethal cancers, leading to lost regulatory function and pathological hallmarks, such as misfolded p53 aggregates and amyloid-like fibrils. Despite decades of research, the molecular determinants driving p53 aggregation and its role in cancer incidence, progression, and lethality remain poorly defined. Identifying these determinants is critical for developing therapeutic interventions that modulate protein solubility in cancer and understanding disparities in cancer outcomes. We investigated whether consensus DNA sequences that stabilize wild-type p53 can regulate the aggregation of oncogenic p53 mutants with reduced binding affinities. We used probe-based and label-free spectroscopic and microscopy techniques to examine how consensus (p21, Bax) and non-consensus (p21-scramble, Poly-GC) DNA oligonucleotides regulate the aggregation of wild-type p53 and three cancer-associated mutants (R248Q, R273H, and R175H). We found equimolar p21 consensus sequences significantly inhibit wild-type p53 aggregation, while other DNA sequences did not. In contrast, oncogenic p53 mutants evaded DNA-based regulation of protein aggregation by all oligonucleotides, and some even showed enhanced aggregation at low concentrations, suggesting complex concentration-dependent DNA-p53 interactions. Our findings emphasize that DNA response elements are sufficient for regulating wild-type p53 aggregation. However, key somatic mutations promote aggregation at the expense of DNA-binding, directly leading to a loss of p53 solubility through biochemical interactions. These observations suggest that potent regulators of p53 aggregation should aim to restore affinity between oncogenic p53 mutants and regulatory DNA to minimize pathological hallmarks of lethal tumors.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Its lethality to Anopheles mosquitoes after feeding on treated hosts offers a promising malaria control strategy, especially for outdoor transmission. However, existing oral formulations produce short-duration mosquitocidal blood concentrations, limiting epidemiological impact. The WHO target product profile for endectocides calls for a hazard ratio >4 and sustained efficacy for at least one month. In this context, three long-acting injectable ivermectin formulations (LAIF) based on BEPO depot technology were evaluated in cattle to evaluate the in vivo performance then to identify the most effective candidate. Methods The LAI candidates (mdc-STM-001, -002, and -003) were tested at 0.6 mg/kg, with mdc-STM-003 also evaluated at 1.5 mg/kg. Each treatment group consisted of five calves, each receiving single sub-cutaneous injection. Plasma samples intensively collected over 130 days enabled non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of ivermectin. Two mosquito strains: Anopheles coluzzii (VK5-pyrethroid-resistant) and Anopheles gambiae (KIS-Kisumu strain) were allowed to simultaneously blood-feed on treated animals from 2 to 126 days post-dose. Mosquito survival was monitored for 30 days. Mortality within 4 and 10 days post-feeding was emphasized, targeting the window before Plasmodium falciparum becomes transmissible. Efficacy was assessed via hazard ratios, cumulative mortality, lethal concentrations (LC) 50 and 90 values, and duration of effective coverage. Results All formulations were well tolerated. mdc-STM-001 showed the most favorable pharmacokinetic profile with a controlled peak (Cmax= 34.5 plus or minus 12.7 ng/mL) and the lowest inter-individual variability (12%). mdc-STM-001 and -003 produced hazard ratios >4 and cumulative mortalities >50% for at least 60 days in both mosquito strains. Surviving mosquitoes had median lifespans below 10 days for at least 90 days post-injection. The 10-day LC50 for resistant mosquitoes (3.66 [2.69-4.97]) was maintained for at leas 126 days. mdc-STM-001 provided 100% coverage at this threshold for at least 2 months. Conclusion mdc-STM-001 is the lead candidate. A single injection allows killing >50% of biting mosquitoes before they become infectious, even in resistant populations, during at least 2 months. Given ivermectin established safety profile, its repurposing in LAIFs offers a promising strategy for malaria control.

In vitro-transcribed mRNA was stored in various NADES at temperatures ranging from 4-50 {ring}C, and the integrity was assessed by quantifying its translatability, represented by protein-expressing cells.

Notably, the preservation efficacy remained unaffected by temperature fluctuations. Furthermore, the selected NADES concentrations maintained ~ 99% cell viability, demonstrating their biocompatibility. These findings establish NADES as efficient, biocompatible RNA storage media, enabling stable storage and transport at ambient and extreme temperatures while withstanding sudden fluctuations.

However, IRF regulation by inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin IL-1 beta (IL1B); and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF), remains under-explored. Since airway epithelial cells (AECs) modulate lung inflammation, IRF expression was characterized in pulmonary A549 and bronchial BEAS-2B epithelial cells, plus primary human AECs grown in submersion or highly differentiated air-liquid interface culture. Whereas most IRF mRNAs were expressed across models, IRF4 and IRF8 showed consistently low expression, and IRF6 was only expressed highly in primary cells. IRF3 and IRF9 were highly expressed in each model, and while protein expression was confirmed in A549 cells, this remained primarily cytoplasmic post-IL1B; treatment. IRF2 was constitutively nuclear in A549 cells and showed moderate/high mRNA expression in each model. IRF1 mRNA was induced by IL-1B; in primary and A549 cells, where IL-1B and TNF dramatically increased IRF1 protein expression. TNF also increased IRF1 protein in BEAS-2B cells. In A549 cells, an IRF reporter system combined with RNA silencing did not support transcriptional roles for IRF2 or IRF3 but suggested a modest role for IRF9 following IL1B; stimulation. IL1B;-induced IRF1 localized to the nucleus of A549 cells revealing a major transcriptional role. IRF1 expression induced by IL1B/TNF required NF-kappa-B (NFkB) and four novel 5' enhancer regions to IRF1 bound the NFkB subunit, p65. These regions drove IL1B/TNF-inducible reporter activity via consensus NFkB motifs. Three such regions recruited RNA polymerase-2 and were flanked by the active chromatin mark, histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation which, given the high levels of genetic conservation, support involvement in IRF1 transcription. Finally, IRF1 expression, transcription rate, and enhancer activity induced by IL1B/TNF were relatively unaffected by glucocorticoid co-treatment. IRF1-dependent gene expression could therefore be insensitive to glucocorticoid and may contribute to glucocorticoid-resistant diseases such as severe asthma.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Using a grid search of 36 parameter combinations, we evaluated four agronomic traits with a comprehensive suite of metrics: Pearsons r, R2, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Fleiss' Kappa for stability. Our findings demonstrate that a low learning rate combined with a high number of boosting rounds substantially improves prediction stability (ICC > 0.98) and selection stability (Fleiss Kappa {approx} 0.90), while also improving generalizability. This combination improved predictive accuracy (r, R2) and ranking efficiency (NDCG) without a trade-off, though optimal settings were trait-dependent. Conversely, classification accuracy (AUC) was poor and performed relatively better with higher learning rates, revealing a conflict in optimization hyperparameters. Despite low absolute performance for most metrics in the challenging cross-environment prediction, NDCG was high (> 0.85), indicating the models excelled at ranking top-performing entries.

Twin prime editing using two coordinated prime editor complexes is a promising strategy for inducing extensive genomic modifications via reverse transcribed complementary templates. However, current twin prime editing systems still require improvements in editing efficiency, accuracy, and intended edit predictability. Here, efficiency and precision of twin prime editing were enhanced via engineering and optimizing conventional SpCas9(H840A)-RT-based prime editor components. A La domain fused prime editor (La-SpCas9(H840A)-RT) and optimized pegRNAs were developed, achieving a 1.75-fold increase in gene editing efficiency at multiple genomic loci in human-derived cell lines without increasing off-target activity. La-SpCas9(H840A)-RT facilitated efficient ~2.8 kb GFP transgene knock-in at target loci and eliminated the expanded polyQ tract in ATXN3 in patient-derived mutant cell lines modeling spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.

While deep learning models achieve high predictive accuracy, their \"black-box\" nature limits clinical translation. To address this, we propose AttentioFuse, an interpretable deep learning framework employing a Reactome-guided mid-fusion strategy for multi-omics integration. AttentioFuse innovates through three pillars: (1) dual-phase learning to preserve omics-specific patterns via independent sub-networks, (2) hierarchical attention mechanisms (cross-omics, feature-level, and fusion-layer) to dynamically quantify layer contributions, and (3) integrated explainability combining DeepSHAP and global attention weights for gene-to-pathway interpretation. Evaluated on TCGA LUAD/LUSC cohorts, AttentioFuse matches state-of-the-art performance in TNM staging, while uncovering actionable biological insights. The framework validates pan-NSCLC mechanisms like AKT/mTOR metabolic control and histology-divergent Notch signaling roles, while revealing novel pathways-developmental reactivation (T-stage), microbiota-driven metastasis (M-stage), and ECM remodeling-providing testable hypotheses for progression and personalized therapy. Crucially, AttentioFuse bridges computational predictions to clinical practice by proposing molecularly-guided combination therapies.

Inhibitor of DNA binding (ID) proteins are regulated by Transforming Growth Factor-{beta}. However, the regulation and the effects of ID proteins in IPF remain poorly understood. We aimed to assess the expression of ID proteins in IPF and determine the effects of ID proteins on human lung fibroblasts (HLF) in vitro and pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Methods: The expression of ID proteins in lungs and lung fibroblasts from mice and human patients with pulmonary fibrosis was evaluated. The effects of ID1/ID3 inhibition and overexpression on HLF were assessed. Genetic and pharmacological approaches were used in vivo to determine the role of ID1/ID3 in pulmonary fibrosis. Results: ID1/ID3 levels were elevated in HLFs isolated from pulmonary fibrosis-diseased patients and mice. ID1/ID3 knockdown decreased IPF-diseased HLF proliferation and differentiation into myofibroblasts. Bleomycin-exposed ID1/ID3 KO mice displayed improved lung function and presented with decreased lung fibrosis when compared to WT mice. A pharmacological inhibitor of ID1/ID3 decreased IPF-diseased HLF proliferation and differentiation in vitro and attenuated pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. A lung specific inhibition of ID1/ID3, using adeno-associated viruses expressing short hairpins targeting ID1 and ID3, reversed pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Mechanistically, ID1/ID3 inhibition decreased fibroblast proliferation through cell cycle genes and inhibited fibroblast differentiation through the MEK/ERK pathway. Conclusions: Our data indicate that a simultaneous inhibition of ID1 and ID3 attenuates pulmonary fibrosis.

In mammals, this regenerative ability is extremely limited, and disruptions in epigenetic mechanisms, particularly those involving DNA methylation and demethylation, may underlie this restricted potential. To explore this possibility, we aimed to develop DNA methylation-targeting molecular tools to enhance the dedifferentiation and neurogenic capacity of primary MG cultures derived from mouse retina. Using CRISPR/dCas9-based gene regulation technology, we selectively and transiently inhibited Dnmt3a, a de novo DNA methyltransferase previously implicated in maintaining transcriptional repression. Our results show that Dnmt3a knockdown leads to sustained upregulation of pluripotency-associated genes, including Ascl1, Lin28, and Nestin, as measured by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. This epigenetic modulation also promoted increased cell proliferation and migration, both hallmarks of a regenerative response. Furthermore, Dnmt3a knockdown, either alone or in combination with neurogenic stimuli, induced MG to acquire neuronal-like morphologies and express the early neuronal marker {beta}III-tubulin. These findings suggest that Dnmt3a acts as a repressive regulator of MG plasticity, likely serving as an epigenetic barrier that counteracts injury-induced demethylation events. Overall, our study identifies Dnmt3a as a critical modulator of MG fate and highlights the potential of its targeted downregulation to facilitate reprogramming. By prolonging the transient progenitor-like state of MG, DNMT3a inhibition may serve as a complementary approach to unlock the neurogenic and regenerative potential of the mammalian retina, offering promising avenues for future therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Both landscapes are highly rugged and contain thousands of fitness peaks, which allow only 2 percent of evolving populations to reach a high fitness peak. The landscapes share only 15 percent of fitness peaks.

D.", "abstract": "[bullet] Background and Aims. The timing of the radiation of nightshades (Solanaceae) has been contentious in the literature, with estimates of the crown age ranging from ca. 30 to 70 Mya (mid-Oligocene to late Cretaceous). The tempo of diversification of major lineages within the family (e.g., berries, tobaccos) has been equally challenging to resolve, in large part because of the paucity of fossil information. Recently described fossils present an opportunity to revisit the timing of nightshade diversification using more powerful model-based methods. Here, we simultaneously infer divergence times within Solanaceae and the placement of a select set of well-preserved and morphologically diverse fruit and seed fossils. [bullet] Methods. We assembled a family-wide morphological dataset, including 17 categorical and eight continuous characters, for 134 living and 14 fossil Solanaceae taxa, as well as sequence data for the extant taxa. We implemented a Bayesian total evidence dating analysis in RevBayes using (a time continuous and a time heterogeneous) fossilized birth-death model and models of character evolution for each type of data. [bullet] Key Results. The origin of Solanaceae was ~98 Mya, and the major splits were roughly three-fold older than previously estimated. Although the 14 fossil taxa were phylogenetically placed with different degrees of confidence, we identified a fruit fossil and a seed fossil whose affinities were strongly supported. Moreover, most of the fossils lacking a precise placement were nevertheless confidently inferred to belong to the large berry clade. [bullet] Conclusions. Our study provides an example of how a sophisticated model used on a carefully assembled dataset can shed light on the timing of the evolution of a group, while accounting for phylogenetic uncertainty. The timetree we present here provides a temporal framework for further research, from comparative genomics and patterns of diversification to trait evolution and biogeography.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Inactivated by small molecule ezrin inhibitors (EzrInh), ezrin is known to regulate cellular functions like adhesion and motility. However, whether ezrin plays any significant role in protecting cells against mechanical stresses is less explored. We use hypo-osmotic shock (HS) to challenge cells and study the mechano-protective role of ezrin. Inhibition of ezrin phosphorylation led to increased cell rupture rates on hypo-shock, with a greater impact at later time points (10 min). The time scales match with that of enhanced tension contrast at edges at the basal plane. We also observed a lowered relative retraction rate at protrusions created by hypo-shock and a less contractile mid-plane cortex, both indicate the role of a weakening of the cortex by EzrInh in compromising membrane integrity on hyposhock. Concomitantly, EzrInh also increased stress fibres (SFs), traction forces and cell spreading clearly indicative of additional cellular pre-stress. Utilizing formin inhibitor (SMIFH2), we showed that formin-mediated actin polymerization was critical for the SF response to EzrInh while it also prevented the subsequent EzrInh-treatment from enhancing cell rupture rates. Together EzrInh reduced mechano-protection in cells by tilting of balance of actin organization from the cortex to SF enhancing formin-mediated SF assembly.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Acute ethanol (EtOH) exposure has been shown to alter theta oscillations, but its effects on transient theta bursts and cross-regional coordination during naturalistic behavior remain unclear. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the medial septum (MS), hippocampal Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in freely foraging mice following intraperitoneal injection of EtOH (1.5 g/kg) or saline. We analyzed spectral power, theta burst dynamics, phase, and lag timing. Burst features from CA1 were used to train a machine learning classifier to predict session condition. EtOH impaired locomotion and reduced goal-directed behaviors, particularly early in the session. In CA1, theta power shifted toward lower frequencies and lagged coherence declined. EtOH increased the frequency but reduced the duration of theta bursts in CA1, and in MS, only burst count increased. EtOH enhanced the temporal alignment of MS-CA1 burst pairs. Phase-locking between CA1 and MS during coupled bursts remained present but showed altered structure. Our classifier achieved robust performance using burst features such as skew and entropy, and reliably distinguished treatment conditions. EtOH modulates septohippocampal dynamics by altering the timing and structure of theta bursts.

ASCC3 has been implicated in transcriptional regulation, alkylation damage repair, and ribosome quality control. In addition, published proteomics studies suggest that ASCC3 is associated with stalled forks. However, little is known about its role in replication stress. Here we report that ASCC3 is recruited to stalled forks by its binding partner ASCC2, whose recruitment to stalled forks is dependent upon both its ubiquitin binding activity and polyubiquitylation of PCNA at K164 that is catalyzed by SHPRH, HLTF, and RFWD3. In response to replication stress. ASCC3 unwinds DNA, generating both parental and nascent ssDNA. This unwinding activity is required to promote fork reversal. We demonstrate that ASCC3 also interacts with RPA and stimulates RPA accumulation on ssDNA upon replication stress, promoting ATR activation. Furthermore, ASCC3 functions to antagonize RAD51-mediated recombination and prevents accumulation of chromosome breaks/gaps and mis-segregation in response to replication stress.

G.; Armstrong, R.; Wells, D.; Robb, E.; McVeigh, P.; Krasky, A.; Harrington, J.; Selzer, P. M.; Marks, N. J.; Maule, A. G.", "abstract": "Fasciola (liver fluke) are parasitic flatworms that impose a significant burden on the agri-food industry and human health. Immature worms can cause severe damage to the liver as they migrate towards the bile ducts, and yet there is only a single drug to treat this pathogenic life stage, driving the need to identify targets for novel flukicides. Given their crucial role in the growth/development of immature Fasciola hepatica, neoblast-like stem cells are an attractive source of new flukicide targets. Kinases are a hugely diverse group of phosphorylating enzymes with key roles in almost all cellular processes. Kinase dysregulation can result in the development of cancerous cells/tissues, linking many to cell cycle-associated proliferation and growth. Here, we annotate the F. hepatica kinome, identifying 271 putative protein kinases, representing around 1.6% of predicted F. hepatica protein-coding genes with family proportions similar to those of other parasitic flatworms. Many of these kinases, such as polo-like kinase 1 (fhplk1), are upregulated in immature worms undergoing rapid growth and development, a process underpinned by the proliferation of neoblast-like stem cells. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of fhplk1 in juvenile liver fluke reduced growth and cell proliferation, suggesting a conserved role within the cell-cycle; the cessation of stem cell proliferation persisted for at least a week following fhplk1-RNAi. A PLK inhibitor (BI 2536) was shown to phenocopy the fhplk1-RNAi phenotype in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the feasibility of targeting F. hepatica neoblast-like cells through kinase inhibitors. Transcriptomic analysis of fhplk1-RNAi juveniles revealed 946 downregulated genes, principally associated with the cell cycle or ribosomes. Over 80 of these downregulated genes were also downregulated following juvenile F. hepatica irradiation, supporting roles for these kinases in neoblast-like stem cells, and marking them as putative targets for control. Among the 1244 upregulated genes in fhplk1-RNAi juvenile worms were many neurotransmitters, receptors and ion channels, exposing the apparent upregulation of diverse inter-cellular signalling systems. While many neurotransmitter pathways promote proliferation in mammalian systems the interaction between neoblast-like stem cells and neuronal signalling in parasitic flatworms remains elusive. Here, the transcriptomic response offhplk1-RNAi juveniles supports a link between neoblast-like stem cell driven growth/development and neuronal signalling.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

However, recent studies have shown that a rare population of cycling cardiomyocytes may confer cardioprotective effects following myocardial infarction (MI). The Myc family - Myc, Mycl, and Mycn - plays central roles in regulating cell cycle progression and cellular plasticity. This raises the possibility that specific Myc isoforms could reactivate the cardiomyocyte cell cycle and promote cardioprotective responses in the ischemic heart. This study aimed to systematically evaluate the effects of Myc, Mycl, and Mycn on cardiomyocyte cell cycle activation and cardiac outcomes following MI. Methods: Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of Myc, Mycl, or Mycn was achieved in adult mice via adeno-associated virus 9 vectors driven by the cardiac troponin T promoter. Cardiomyocyte cell cycle activity, structural remodeling, and functional outcomes were assessed using RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and transthoracic echocardiography. Cardioprotective effects were evaluated in MI model mice. Results: While all three Myc family members activated cell cycle-related gene expression to varying degrees, Mycn elicited the most robust response. Mycn overexpression significantly enhanced cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry, as demonstrated by increased 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation and phosphorylation of histone H3. Mycn also induced hypertrophic growth, reflected by increased cardiomyocyte size and heart mass. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that Mycn uniquely upregulated genes associated with extracellular matrix remodeling and paracrine signaling, typically enriched in neonatal cardiomyocytes and previously linked to cardioprotection. Functionally, Mycn expression preserved cardiac contractility after MI, reduced infarct size, and increased capillary density in peri-infarct regions. Conclusions: These findings identify Mycn as a functionally distinct member of the Myc family in the adult heart, capable of reactivating the cardiomyocyte cell cycle and promoting cardiac protection after ischemic injury. The cardioprotective effects appear to be mediated, in part, by the induction of a neonatal-like gene expression program supporting a stress-adaptive cardiac microenvironment.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

This study combines geolocated social media data and ecological niche models (ENMs) to assess the spatial patterns and key drivers of CES supply across eight mountain PAs spanning distinct biogeographical regions in Spain and Portugal. Using deep learning techniques to classify more than 200,000 photographs into ten CES categories, we evaluated model performance under two modeling approaches and identified the most influential environmental and social predictors. Most CES categories exhibited good model performance (Boyce index > 0.5), though variation existed across services and regions. Nature & Landscape and Gastronomy CES showed strong associations with park boundaries and human settlements, respectively, while Religious and Cultural CES were spatially linked to culturally significant landmarks.. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining social media data with ENMs to map CES distributions and reveal both universal and context-dependent drivers. This approach offers valuable insights for integrating CES into PA management and spatial planning, supporting more holistic and culturally inclusive conservation strategies.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

These ligand-receptor interactions occur in an oxidative environment that is known to induce post-translational modifications, notably on the cysteine residues present in S100 proteins. How cysteine oxidation affects the architecture of S100 proteins and their interaction with RAGE remains poorly understood as most in vitro studies employ cysteine mutants or reduced conditions. Using our model protein S100A6 and size exclusion chromatography-based binding assays in non-reducing conditions, we here demonstrate that the unique cysteine of S100A6, Cys3, is essential for the binding to RAGE. We further show that full complexation can be restored by introducing a cysteine at conserved position 84, where a Cys residue is found in at least ten other RAGE-binding S100 proteins. Structural analysis of the resulting complex between RAGE ectodomain and S100A6 mutant Y84C further reveals that the presence of Cys84 induces the formation of a covalent disulfide bond between the two S100A6 protomers, thus stabilizing the same RAGE-bound S100A6 conformation as with the WT protein. Finally, modeling of other S100 proteins in the RAGE-bound conformation suggests that this covalent S100 dimer architecture may be adopted by other members of the family, already reported to form disulfide-crosslinked oligomeric species. Altogether, our findings highlight the importance of S100 cysteines for the binding to RAGE and provide a first molecular model for S100 covalent homodimerization.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Pancreatic {beta}-cells in pre-type 1 diabetes (T1D) experience stress due to islet inflammation, which accompanies early defects in insulin secretion that precede autoimmune destruction. One product of inflammatory stress is protein carbonylation (PC), brought on by reactive oxygen species (ROS) combining with lipids to produce reactive aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) that irreversibly modify Cys, His, and Lys sidechains. In this study, we used proteomics to measure patterns of PC in pancreatic islets from 10-week-old pre-diabetic NOD mice and in cultured insulin-secreting cells treated with either 4-HNE or pro-inflammatory cytokines. All three stress conditions increased carbonylation of proteins central to {beta}-cell function including Rab GTPases and other proteins that are essential for vesicle trafficking. Gene ontology analysis indicates that the affected proteins and pathways in pre-diabetic NOD islets reflect a combination of those impacted by 4-HNE and cytokine treatment. Furthermore, both 4-HNE and cytokines significantly inhibited insulin secretion by ~50% in cultured MIN6 and INS-1-GRINCH cells. In particular, exposure to 4-HNE for as little as 5 minutes suppressed insulin secretion and increased the carbonylation of over 1000 proteins. Overall, the observed PC pattern in pre-T1D islets is consistent with a model in which {beta}-cells experience multiple sources of oxidative stress, including ROS generation within {beta}-cells themselves and reactive compounds released by infiltrating immune cells. The latter exogenous source may represent a novel rapid mechanism for inhibiting insulin secretion.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Insulin treatment decreases neurodegeneration and intranasal insulin has been shown to reach the central nervous system in neurodegenerative diseases like dementia. We tested the hypothesis that intranasal insulin can decrease retinal neurodegeneration using the C57BL/KsJ-db/db transgenic diabetic (db/db) mouse model. Compared to the non-diabetic wildtype mice given intranasal saline, we observed decreased electroretinogram b-wave and oscillatory potential amplitudes in db/db mice treated with intranasal saline but not in the db/db mice treated with 2 units of intranasal insulin daily over 10 weeks. When compared to the non-diabetic intranasal saline control, we also observed decreased outer retinal thickness in the db/db mice given intranasal saline but this effect was attenuated in the db/db mice treated with intranasal insulin. GFAP immunoreactivity and caspase cell count were similarly elevated in the db/db mice treated with intranasal saline but not intranasal insulin. Mean blood glucose measurements increased 30 minutes after both intranasal saline and insulin treatment. Transcriptomic analysis revealed downregulation of inflammatory and apoptotic genes in the retina of db/db mice treated with intranasal insulin when compared to saline. In summary, treatment with intranasal insulin prevents the depression of b-waves and oscillatory potentials, decreases the attenuation of outer retinal thickness, reduces caspase cell count and GFAP immunostaining, and downregulates the transcription of inflammatory and apoptotic genes in the retina of db/db mice without exerting peripheral glucose lowering effects. Taken together, our results suggest that intranasal insulin can reduce neurodegeneration in diabetic retinopathy by improving retinal neuronal function, decreasing reactive gliosis and cell death, and modulating the expression of inflammatory and apoptotic genes.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAV) have emerged as a viable vector for gene therapy, with several clinical approvals and a growing pipeline in clinical trials. These vectors have several challenges that need to be addressed to widen their use, including improving tropisms, reducing manufacturing costs, increasing storage stability, minimising their immunogenicity, or evasion of existing AAV immunity in which neutralising antibodies lead to loss of potency. Vector engineering, particularly capsid protein engineering, offers a potential route to generating new capsids that can selectively target desired cell types or evade pre-existing immunity, while also ensuring that they are manufacturable at higher titres, more stable, and have reduced immunogenicity. Extensive protein redesign is emerging as a viable option, through generative AI approaches, for engineering many types of protein. Here we explored the potential of ProteinMPNN, to extensively redesign AAV2 and yet still form stable and functional capsids. We targeted 52% of AAV2 residues for redesign by ProteinMPNN, such that only the buried protein core and subunit interfaces would be varied, leaving the capsid external and internal surface features unchanged. The aim was to significantly modify the structure responsible for assembly and capsid integrity, while maximising the probability of maintaining the wild-type DNA packaging and transduction capabilities. The final designs were between 14% and 30% mutated overall, and yet were capable of forming functional and intact capsids, with the transduction efficiency of wild type retained for some variants. The designs generally led to lower titres from cell culture, yet some designs had either improved capsid packaging efficiency or transduction efficiency. In particular, our Pentamer design had the best transduction efficiency, while our Chimera design had a packaging efficiency that was 2.5x higher than for the WT AAV2. These results demonstrate the potential to use generative AI tools in vector capsid redesign for novel core assembly features, and now pave the way for expanding this approach into selectively re-engineering their surface properties to influence tropism, immunogenicity and transduction efficiency.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

Moreover, missense mutations in -synuclein are related to familial forms of this neurodegenerative disorder, making their detection at the single-molecule level essential. Recently, protein sequencing using solid-state nanopores has emerged as a powerful, label-free approach for single-molecule sensing with high sensitivity. Atomically thin two-dimensional materials, such as MoSMoS2, provide ideal platforms for sequencing applications due to their ultimate thinness and enhanced spatial resolution. However, protein sequencing using 2D materials remains challenging because of rapid translocation speeds, which limit the observation time per molecule. Here, we present extensive all-atom classical molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent of the full translocation of the wild-type -synuclein protein and two pathogenic mutants, i.e. A30P and E46K, through single-layer MoSMoS2 nanopores, for a total duration of more than 22 microsenconds. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first atomistic simulation of a full-length protein sequencing through a 2D solid-state nanopore. From the ionic current traces recorded during simulations, we characterized distinct blockade levels and bumps, as well as their dwell time along the protein sequence at multiple time and sequence length scales. For instance, we provided the sequence motifs that show some particular patterns in the data. Furthermore, we analyzed the volume properties of amino acids inside the pore and identified characteristic blockade fingerprints differentiating the wild-type from the mutant proteins.

Here we used state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations and experiments to test a hypothesis that fentanyl's extreme potency is driven by its ability to partition into the plasma membrane, creating a drug reservoir near the receptor. The estimated effective permeability of fentanyl at pH 7.5 is on the order of 10e-7 cm/s -- at least two orders of magnitude faster than morphine. In contrast, isotonitazene (a newly emerged UPS opioid) and naloxone (an antagonist) effectively do not partition into the membrane under the same conditions. The simulations captured the proton-coupled permeation processes, challenging the long-standing pH-partition hypothesis. Subsequent reporter cell line experiments demonstrated that cells exposed to fentanyl, but not morphine, reactivated the receptor even after washout and addition of naloxone. Immobilized affinity membrane chromatography confirmed that fentanyl has significantly higher phospholipid affinity than morphine.

While STAT3 is canonically activated by cytokines such as IL-6, this activation is typically transient due to negative feedback mechanisms. In CRC, however, STAT3 is aberrantly and persistently activated, promoting tumor cell proliferation and survival. Here, we demonstrate that glucose sustains STAT3 activation independent of cytokine availability. By manipulating glucose metabolism, we show that both glucose and its downstream metabolite, GlcNAc, are essential for maintaining STAT3 activation. Moreover, cells with high basal STAT3 activity produce glucose-dependent glycosylated proteins that can activate STAT3 in neighboring cells via paracrine signaling. Proteomic analysis identified multiple candidate proteins involved in this process; however, no single protein was sufficient to fully activate STAT3, suggesting that a combination of glycosylated proteins likely acts synergistically. In vivo, inhibition of glycolysis reduces STAT3 activation in tumors, and genetic deletion of STAT3 in subcutaneous tumor models significantly decreases tumor growth. Together, these findings uncover a novel mechanism by which glucose metabolism supports sustained STAT3 activation in CRC, highlighting a potential metabolic vulnerability for therapeutic targeting.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

To achieve this, they integrate multimodal sensory inputs with their internal drive to constantly adjust their motor output. This integration involves the interplay of neuronal populations across different hierarchical levels along the sensorimotor axis - from sensory, central, and modulatory neurons in the brain to descending neurons and motor networks in the nerve cord. Here, we characterize two populations of neurons that control distinct aspects of walking on different hierarchical levels in Drosophila. First, we use in-vivo electrophysiological recordings to demonstrate that moonwalker descending neurons (MDN) integrate antennal touch to drive changes in walking direction from forward to backward. Second, we establish DopaMeander as an important component in the control of forward walking through a combination of optogenetic activation, silencing, connectomics, and in-vivo recordings. These dopaminergic modulatory neurons drive forward walking with increased turning, and the activity of individual neurons is correlated with ipsiversive turning. Hence, MDN and DopaMeander control opposite regimes of walking on different hierarchical levels. Computational models reveal that their activity predicts key parameters of spontaneous walking. Moreover, we find that both MDN and DopaMeander are gated out during flight. This suggests that neuronal populations across levels of control are modulated by the behavioral state to minimize cross-talk between motor programs.", "date": "2025-07-26", "journal": ""}

The resulting hybrids of wide hybridization showed typical wild species characters like tillering, prolificacy on main tiller and side tillers, and ear characters. This shows the introgression of characters from wild species. Combining ability analysis revealed the presence of a significant amount of variability among parents and crosses for most traits under study.
