E.; Huang, L.; Liufu, Z.; Wu, C.-I.; Wen, H.", "abstract": "Multi-copy gene systems that evolve within, as well as between, individuals are common. They include viruses, mitochondrial DNAs, multi-gene families etc. The paradox is that neutral evolution in two stages should be slower than single-copy systems but the opposite is often true. We now apply the Haldane model, recently generalized as the GH model (1), to quantify genetic drift in mammalian ribosomal RNA genes (rDNAs). On average, the copy number (C ) is 150 - 300 per haploid. A neutral mutation in rDNA should take 4NC* generations to become fixed (N, the population size; C *, the effective copy number within individuals). While C > C* >> 1 is expected, the observed fixation time in mouse is < 4N, leading to the paradox of C* < 1. Genetic drift of rRNA genes thus appears 10 -100 times stronger than in single-copy genes. The large increases are driven by a host of molecular mechanisms such as gene conversion and unequal crossover. Although each mechanism of drift is very difficult to quantify, the GH model permits the estimation of their total effects that constitute the aggregate \"evolutionary noises\". In humans, the fixation rate of rRNA genes is higher than the theoretical maximum of drift, hence, justifying the inference of adaptive evolution. In conclusion, the stochastic evolution in multi-copy gene systems, including viruses and others, can be effectively tracked by GH model.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "In populations with limited recombination, clonal interference among beneficial mutations limits the maximum rate of adaptation. Spatial structure slows the spread of beneficial alleles; in purely asexual populations, this increases the amount of clonal interference. Beyond this extreme case, however, it is unclear how spatial structure and recombination interact to determine the amount of clonal interference. This interaction is particularly interesting because dispersal and recombination are often at least partially synchronized in natural populations, both at the individual and population level, as when plants switch from vegetative growth to sexual reproduction or stress responses increase both motility and recombination in microbes. We simulate island models of populations evolving on a smooth fitness landscape and find that synchronized dispersal and sexual reproduction allow them to adapt faster than matched well-mixed populations. This is because the spatial structure preserves genetic diversity, while the synchronization increases the chance that recombination events occur between diverged individuals from different demes, i.e., the pairings where negative linkage disequilibrium can most effectively be reduced.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

The primary insulator protein in vertebrates is CTCF, a DNA-binding protein (DBP); however, the roles of other DBPs in EPI insulation are not fully understood. To address this, we developed a systematic and comprehensive deep learning-based approach to identify DNA motifs of DBPs associated with insulator function. Applying this method to human fibroblast cells, we identified 97 directional motifs and a smaller number of non-directional motifs. These motifs were mapped to 23 DBPs previously linked to insulator activity, CTCF, and/or other forms of chromosomal transcriptional regulation. We found that the estimated orientation bias of CTCF was consistently proportional to the orientation bias observed in chromatin interaction data. Furthermore, these motifs showed significant enrichment at insulator sites that separate repressive and active chromatin regions, at chromatin interaction-defined boundaries, and at splice sites, compared to motifs of other DBPs. For instance, we observed that the key regulator MyoD-binding site is located at an insulator site near a gene involved in skeletal muscle differentiation and function. Importantly, our findings support the previously proposed insulator-pairing model, which suggests that insulator-insulator interactions are orientation-dependent, and highlight the involvement of multiple DNA-binding proteins beyond CTCF. Together, these results provide new insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms mediated by insulator-associated DBPs.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

In addition, only a small number of mutants are typically used in each study. Herein, a comparative analysis of nine HSV-1 mutants lacking specific structural proteins was performed using correlative fluorescence microscopy and X-ray tomography for the first time, revealing the relative roles of each viral protein in virus assembly. pUL11, pUL51, gK, and gE were shown to have important roles in cytoplasmic envelopment, with the loss of their functions leading to various stalled cytoplasmic envelopment phenotypes involving polarised arrays of capsids at one side of cytoplasmic vesicles that to our knowledge have never been seen with TEM. This correlative imaging approach enabled the study of cytoplasmic envelopment in 3D, revealing an envelopment mechanism driven by capsid budding rather than membrane wrapping. Further cryoSIM experiments revealed that pUL16 and pUL21 are important in nuclear egress of HSV-1 and that VP16 promotes nuclear egress and delivery of capsids to cytoplasmic envelopment compartments. By providing novel and comparative insights into the roles of different viral proteins in various stages of HSV-1 assembly, these findings highlight the utility of correlative cryo-fluorescence plus cryo-soft-X-ray tomography for probing trajectories of intracellular pathogen assembly.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we derive how the genetic variance within a population is changed under the influence of indirect maternal, paternal and parent-of-origin effects under random mating. We also consider indirect effects of a sibling, in particular how the genetic variance is altered when looking at the phenotypic difference between two siblings. The calculations are then extended to include assortative mating (AM), which alters the variance by inducing increased homozygosity and correlations within and across loci. AM likely leads to covariance of parental genetic effects, a measure of the similarity of parents in the indirect effects they have on their children. We propose that this assortment for parental characteristics, where biological parents create similar environments for their children, can create shared parental effects across traits and the appearance of cross-trait AM. Interestingly, the genetic variances is increased under AM for the child- mother-father design, while it is decreased for the sibling difference. Our results demonstrate that it is not possible to get unbiased estimates of direct genetic effects without controlling for parental and parent-of-origin effects.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

However, it is often influenced by biases, i.e, systematic recognition advantages for particular emotions. Nevertheless, these biases are inconsistently reported across studies, likely due to methodological variations which underline the necessity for a standardized approach. Traditional face morphing methods can create unnatural-looking stimuli, and may confound the interpretation of emotions. To address this issue, we here introduce STEMorph, a validated stimulus set based on the NimStim set. We employed neutral-anchored morphing and neural-network-generated masks to ensure the natural appearance and integrity of the depicted emotions. We validated our stimulus set by having participants rate each face on a 9-point scale ranging from angry to happy, assessing the perceived emotional intensity. STEMorph's validity was confirmed through linear regression analysis, showing a strong correlation between subjective ratings and targeted emotional states. Moreover, aligning with previous research highlighting gender as a key factor in emotion recognition, STEMorph also exhibits variations in ratings across gender subgroups. STEMorph's reliability was confirmed through a two-week follow-up rating session with a subgroup of the same participants. By introducing a controlled, validated, and ecologically valid stimulus set of emotional faces, STEMorph paves the way for further investigations into facial emotion recognition, deepening our understanding of this vital aspect of human interaction.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Yet, only a handful of reports exist on harbor seal vocal learning abilities, and even fewer document how these were trained or tested. Here, we investigate how, and if, two experimentally naive harbor seals under human care can be trained to participate in scientific experiments. We describe the training and testing of two seals in two basic vocal learning experiments. We trained the animals to vocalize upon the presentation of discriminative stimuli (SD) through operant conditioning methods and tested their abilities to i) vocalize and refrain from vocalizing on two distinct S D's, and ii) produce two different vocalizations upon the presentation of two different SD's. Both seals learned the tasks: the first task was achieved within 118 trials (22 errors to criterion) and 220 trials (40 errors to criterion), the second task within 480 trials (158 errors to criterion) and 380 trials (94 errors to criterion), respectively.

Using a common garden setup, we comparatively investigated how smRNAs, including those targeting TEs, contribute to post-allopolyploid genome stabilization and ecological divergence in two sibling allotetraploid marsh orchids (Dactylorhiza majalis and D. traunsteineri) and their diploid progenitors. Despite independent origins, both allopolyploids exhibited substantial overlap in smRNA targeting, including transgressive overexpression around genes linked to stress response, cell division and transcriptional regulation. TE-targeting 24 nt smRNAs followed patterns consistent with subgenome size and origin, while shorter 20-23 nt smRNAs displayed greater divergence. The older allotetraploid D. majalis exhibited enhanced smRNA-mediated fine-tuning of gene copy number regulation, while its younger sibling D. traunsteineri showed more pronounced non-additive expression patterns, suggesting ongoing resolution of post-polyploid meiotic and mitotic instability.

Even rare variants such as doubletons, which should be particularly informative about recent demography, may have multiple origins despite arising relatively recently in the population. Here, we develop methods first to estimate the frequency of recurrent doubletons in a population genomic dataset from the occurrence of tri-allelic sites with two different singleton mutations, and then to identify a subset of high confidence single origin doubletons based on the presence of a linked rare variant on the surrounding shared haplotype. Applying these methods to data for the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae sampled from across Africa, we estimate that up to ~16% of reported doubletons have independent origins. We then identify a set of doubletons likely (~99%) to have a single origin, which consists of ~68% of all the expected single origin doubletons (and ~57% of all observed doubletons).

During growth, somatic mutations accumulate along these branching structures and can become fixed in reproductive tissues such as flowers and fruits. Because mature trees produce tens of thousands of terminal branches, each harboring potentially mutated gametes, limiting the accumulation of somatic mutations is critical to avoid mutational meltdown and inbreeding depression. Although recent evidence suggests that long-lived plants have evolved mechanisms to suppress mutation accumulation, the developmental basis for this remains unclear. Here we develop a theoretical model that connects crown development with cell lineage sampling to show that branching architecture can strongly suppress somatic mutation accumulation in trees, often to the same extent as reducing the mutation rate itself. Specifically, tree forms that promote developmental path-sharing among branches suppress the number of unique mutational lineages in the crown. We find that this architectural effect can alter mutation burden by orders of magnitude, even when mutation rates and terminal branch numbers remain constant. These insights suggest that branching strategies may evolve not only to optimize growth and resource allocation, but also to limit the accumulation of somatic variants during ontogeny.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Here, to explicitly test this at the behavioral level, we designed a novel fully-automated two-choice social operant paradigm where individuals can choose between same and opposite-sex social rewards and rewards are delivered for interaction with systematically varying durations. We trained cohorts of both sexes on this task and quantified the patterns of choices. We used choice latency as a metric to infer moment-to-moment satiety to test whether increased interaction duration leads to increased moment-to-moment satiety. We find that although both males and females have stable choice biases across sessions, with males showing consistent opposite sex biases, only males exhibit behavioral signatures of moment-to-moment social satiety and are sensitive to the duration of interaction. Using a simple normative model to capture patterns of social choice, we observe that behavior is better fit by a model that has a single evolving social drive and choice bias, rather than a model with multiple, independent drives for same and opposite-sex interactions. Together, our data reveal behavioral signatures of social satiety and offer new insights into the underlying homeostatic and motivational drives that govern social choices.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

However, gene expression cannot yet be systematically predicted from genome sequences, in part because non-functional matches to the sequence patterns (motifs) recognized by transcription factors (TFs) occur frequently throughout the genome. Large-scale functional genomics data for many TFs has enabled characterization of regulatory networks in experimentally accessible cells such as budding yeast. Beyond yeast, fungi are important industrial organisms and pathogens, but large-scale functional data is only sporadically available. Uncharacterized regulatory networks control key pathways and gene expression programs associated with fungal phenotypes. Here we explore a sequence-only approach to inferring regulatory networks by leveraging the 100s of genomes now available for many clades of fungi. We use gene orthology as the learning signal to infer interpretable, TF motif-based representations of non-coding regulatory regions. Using these representations to identify conserved signals for motifs, comparative genomics can be scaled to evolutionary comparisons where sequence similarity cannot be detected. We show that similarity of these conserved motif signals predicts gene expression and regulation better than using experimental data, and that we can infer known and novel regulatory connections in diverse fungi. Our new predictions include a pathway for recombination in C. albicans and pathways for mating and an RNAi immune response in Neurospora. Taken together, our results indicate that specific hypotheses about transcriptional regulation in fungi can be obtained for many genes from genome sequence analysis alone.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Existing analysis frameworks, such as those that use kinetic models, often rely on strong assumptions on the dynamics of the molecules and fluorophores under study that render them inappropriate for general purpose step-counting applications, especially when the systems of study exhibit uncharacterized dynamics. Here, we propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric framework to analyze single-molecule fluorescence data that is kinetic model independent. For the evaluation of our methods, we develop four MCMC samplers, ranging from elemental to highly sophisticated, and demonstrate that the added complexity is essential for accurate data analysis. We apply our methods to experimental data obtained from TIRF photobleaching assays of the EphA2 receptor tagged with GFP. In addition, we validate our approach with synthetic data mimicking realistic conditions and demonstrate its ability to recover ground truth under high- and low-signal-to-noise data, establishing it as a versatile tool for fluorescence data analysis.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Structural studies of protein-translocating AAA+ machines proposed a coupled and sequential translocation process, whereby ATP hydrolysis events lead to short threading steps. Yet, direct real-time observation of these events remains elusive. Here, we employ single-molecule FRET spectroscopy to track substrate translocation through ClpB, a quality control AAA+ machine. We isolate ClpB and its substrate within lipid vesicles and find that translocation events, while dependent on ATP, take milliseconds, much faster than ATP hydrolysis times. Surprisingly, the translocation rate depends weakly on temperature and ATP concentration. Using three-color FRET experiments, we find that translocation events can occur bidirectionally but are not always complete. Replacing ATP with the slowly hydrolysable analog ATP{gamma}S abolishes both rapid translocation and directionality. These results indicate a fast, stochastic Brownian-motor-like mechanism, redefining how ATP is coupled with mechanical action in AAA+ machines.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

In chronic exposure models, this loss often occurs by extrusion of the HC from the sensory epithelium towards the luminal cavity. HC extrusion is preceded by several steps that begin with detachment and synaptic uncoupling of the cells from the afferent terminals of their postsynaptic vestibular ganglion neurons. The purpose of this study was to identify gene expression mechanisms that drive these responses to chronic ototoxic stress. We conducted four RNA-seq experiments that generated five comparisons of control versus treated animals. These involved two species (rat and mouse), two compounds (streptomycin and 3,3'-iminodipropionitrile, IDPN), and three time points in our rat/IDPN model. We compared differentially expressed genes and their associated Gene Ontology terms, and several genes of interest were validated by in-situ hybridisation and immunofluorescence analyses. Common and model-unique expression responses were identified. The earliest and most robust common response was downregulation of HC-specific genes, including stereocilium (Atp2b2, Xirp2), synaptic (Nsg2), and ion channel genes (Kcnab1, Kcna10), together with new potential biomarkers of HC stress (Vsig10l2). A second common response across species and compounds was the upregulation of the stress mediator Atf3. Model- or time-restricted responses included downregulation of cell-cell adhesion and mitochondrial ATP synthesis genes, and upregulation of the interferon response, unfolded protein response, and tRNA aminoacylation genes. The present results provide key information on the responses of the vestibular sensory epithelium to chronic ototoxic stress, potentially relevant to other types of chronic stress.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

This work aims to develop and personalize whole-brain computational models in epilepsy using multimodal clinical data to simulate and evaluate individualized therapeutic strategies. We present a computational framework that constructs patient-specific whole-brain models of seizure propagation by integrating SEEG, MRI, and diffusion MRI data. The pipeline uses neural mass models for each node in the network, simulating whole-brain dynamics. Model personalization involves adjusting global and local parameters representing the excitability of individual brain areas, using an evolutionary algorithm that aims to maximize the correlation between empirical and synthetic functional connectivity matrices derived from SEEG data. The resulting personalized models successfully reproduce individual seizure propagation patterns and can be used to simulate therapeutic interventions like surgery, stimulation, or pharmacological interventions within a unified physiological framework. Notably, model predictions reveal distinct patient-specific responses across interventions, including variable sensitivity to different pharmacological agents and identification of critical regions whose removal or modulation reduced seizure spread. This framework provides a mechanistic, interpretable approach to simulate and compare individualized treatment strategies. By integrating multimodal data into a unified whole-brain model, it has the potential to improve clinical decision-making in epilepsy by identifying accessible and functionally relevant targets.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Visual responses in the cerebral cortex are strongly influenced by shifts in spatial attention. This modulation of visual processing includes changes in firing rate, decreased response variability, and decreased interneuronal correlations; all of which are thought to underlie enhanced visual perception near the center of attention at the cost of visual perception at other locations. Visual information from the retina is relayed to primary visual cortex via neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the dorsal thalamus. Although early studies describe an enhancement of LGN activity with spatial attention, more recent work has cast doubt on this view. Given its strategic position as the gateway to the cortex, an understanding of the effects of attention on visual processing in the LGN is important. We therefore performed experiments to reexamine the influence of covert spatial attention on the spiking activity of single units in the macaque LGN and applied a broad set of analyses and functional metrics to assess possible effects. Our results reveal a statistically significant effect of spatial attention in the LGN: firing rates were slightly higher and more reliable when monkeys directed attention towards the receptive fields of recorded neurons compared to when attention was directed to different retinotopic locations. However, effects were much smaller than previously reported (~1% vs ~4%) and further analyses suggest that effects are weak and inconsistent. Thus, while spatial attention does exert an influence in the LGN, its effects are weak and may have limited impact on downstream processing.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

It plays a role, for example, in molecular association processes and in theories of spectroscopic experiments in solution. In addition to experimental methods, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as a powerful method to investigate rotational diffusion. Thereby, diffusion models are fitted to rotational correlation functions extracted from the simulations. In this work, we conducted a time-dependent analysis of the model parameters prior to fitting, using extended all-atom MD simulations of ubiquitin as a model system. A comparison to Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations confirms whether the rotational dynamics observed in MD actually follow the theory of Brownian rigid-body diffusion. In addition, the analysis reveals correlation time intervals that are suitable for fitting anisotropic, semi-isotropic, or isotropic diffusion models. To this end, a two-step optimization scheme is employed that combines a global and a local search in parameter space. BD simulations are used to estimate uncertainties of the diffusion coefficients as well as directional uncertainties of the principal axes. BD simulations are used to estimate uncertainties of the diffusion coefficients as well as directional uncertainties of the principal axes. We found that ubiquitin exhibits nearly semi-isotropic rotational dynamics, in good agreement with experimental NMR data.

However, most publicly available sleep classifiers are trained on scalp EEG from traditional polysomnography (PSG) data, and thus generalize poorly to forehead EEG due to differences in electrode placement, referencing montages, and higher susceptibility to artifacts from user movements and electrode displacement. Conventional classifiers typically do not explicitly account for these artifacts, resulting in inaccurate and misleading sleep stage scoring. To address this gap, we developed a suite of artifact-aware sleep stage classifiers trained specifically using forehead EEG data, leveraging two comprehensive datasets --Wearanize+ and Donders2022-- that contain concurrent forehead EEG and clinical PSG recordings. We further introduce two classifier variants: one optimized for real-time applications that operates directly on raw EEG amplitudes, and another optimized for offline analysis utilizing normalized EEG signals. Validation results indicate robust and reliable classification performance across standard sleep stages (Wake, N1, N2, N3, REM), along with effective identification of artifact epochs.

We equipped rhizoboxes with O2-sensitive planar optodes to simultaneously monitor root growth and rhizosphere/soil O2 concentrations.

Previous evidence suggests complex interactions between iron status and malaria susceptibility. However, the mechanisms and clinical implications of this relationship remain poorly understood. Methods: We employed a multilayered integrated approach to clarify the association between iron deficiency and malaria infection risk. First, we analyzed clinical data from Malawian pregnant women (n=711) participating in the REVAMP clinical trial -- an RCT of intravenous iron versus oral iron -- to assess associations between iron status and P. falciparum parasitemia detected by ultra-sensitive qPCR. All eligible women received intermittent preventive anti-malaria treatment. Then, we utilized a genetic mouse model (Tmprss6-knockout) to isolate the effect of iron deficiency on P. berghei infection and progression to clinical disease. Finally, we explored direct effects of iron chelation on cultured P. falciparum parasites through transcriptomic and proteomic analyses. Results: In REVAMP, iron deficiency was associated with a 50% reduced probability of P. falciparum qPCR positivity at baseline (95% CI [30%-64%], p<0.0001). Iron intervention given at baseline did not significantly modify the probability of subsequent parasitemia across the pregnancy. In the murine model, iron-deficient Tmprss6-knockout mice exhibited significantly improved survival compared to controls (median survival 15.5 vs. 7.0 days) and protection from cerebral malaria (survival 83% vs 17%). Iron chelation in P. falciparum cultures induced substantial transcriptomic (1,397 differentially expressed genes) and proteomic changes (121 differentially expressed proteins; 46 matched differentially expressed gene/protein pairs), primarily affecting processes involved in host cell invasion, protein export, and nutrient acquisition. Conclusion: Our findings consistently demonstrate that iron deficiency protects against Plasmodium infection across clinical, pre-clinical, and in vitro models. Importantly, in the presence of adequate malaria prevention intravenous iron supplementation did not significantly increase subsequent parasitemia prevalence. These results provide mechanistic insights into iron and malaria interactions and support current WHO recommendations for iron supplementation in pregnant women in malaria-endemic regions when coupled with adequate malaria prevention strategies.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Across the major subtypes of haemorrhagic stroke (subarachnoid, intracerebral, and intraventricular haemorrhages), the presence of blood in the CSF generates significant tissue damage in the first 72 hours after the event, known as early brain injury (EBI). EBI includes neuroinflammation, blood-brain barrier breakdown and dysregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamics. ECM dysfunction has been shown to trigger fibrosis of the cortical blood vessels, limiting normal CSF circulation and resulting in the buildup of metabolic waste or the development of post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Limiting or preventing this fibrosis may therefore reduce the rate of morbidity experienced by survivors, providing a potential avenue for non-surgical treatment to reduce secondary brain injury post-stroke. Despite this, current in vivo approaches fail to differentiate between the effect of blood products and secondary consequences including intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation and mass effect. Here, we describe an adult rat organotypic brain slice culture (OBSC) model of haemorrhagic stroke which enables the identification of the effect of blood products on ECM dysregulation. We demonstrate the distribution of key cell types across a time course of 0, 3 and 7 days in culture, indicating that such cultures are viable for a minimum of 7 days. Using immunofluorescence staining, Western blotting and RNA sequencing, we show that exposure of OBSCs to lysed blood markedly increases ECM deposition around cortical blood vessels. This is accompanied by dysregulation of ECM regulatory genes and upregulation of inflammation and oxidative stress-related genes, successfully recapitulating the changes seen in human stroke survivors. This versatile ex vivo model provides a translational platform to further understanding of haemorrhagic stroke pathophysiology and develop or trial novel therapeutics prior to progression to in vivo stroke studies.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Furthermore, we show that the model embeddings encode cross-species evolutionary relationships, clustering promoters by {sigma} factor identity rather than species-specific sequence features. Finally, we show that model embeddings encode regulatory sequence information that enables effective prediction of transcription and translation levels. PromoterAtlas can contribute to our understanding of and ability to engineer bacterial regulatory sequences with potential applications in bacterial biology, synthetic biology, and comparative genomics.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "The simple linear threshold units used in many artificial neural networks have a limited computational capacity. Famously, a single unit cannot handle non-linearly separable problems like XOR. In contrast, real neurons exhibit complex morphologies as well as active dendritic integration, suggesting that their computational capacities outperform those of simple linear units. Considering specific families of Boolean functions, we empirically examine the computational limits of single units that incorporate more complex dendritic structures. For random Boolean functions, we show that there is a phase transition in learnability as a function of the input dimension, with most random functions below a certain critical dimension being learnable and those above not. This critical dimension is best predicted by the overall size of the dendritic arbor. This demonstrates that real neurons have a far higher computational complexity than is usually considered in neural models, whether in machine learning or computational neuroscience. Furthermore, using architectures that are, respectively, more 'apical' or 'basal', we show that there are non-trivially disjoint sets of learnable functions by each type of neuron. Importantly, these two types of architectures differ in the robustness and generality of the computations they can perform. The basal-like architecture shows a higher probability of function realization, while the apical-like architecture shows an advantage with fast retraining for different functions. Given the cell-type specificity of morphological characteristics, these results suggest both that different components of the dendritic arbor as well as distinct cell types may have distinct computational roles.

Several studies have reported clock gene expression in microglia and the circadian rhythm they drive has been linked to the modulation of immune responses and neuronal functions. In the current study, complementary approaches, including immunofluorescence, multiplexed fluorescence in situ hybridization, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry proteomics of isolated CD11b+ microglia, were combined with publicly available transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets to investigate the expression of the core clock gene BMAL1 in human post-mortem cortical and limbic areas as well as mouse brain. The majority of BMAL1-expressing cells were found to be neurons, with microglia representing a negligeable proportion. We also identified significantly lower chromatin accessibility or ''openness'' for BMAL1 gene regulatory regions (such as promoters and enhancers) in microglia compared to neurons. These regulatory regions in microglia were enriched for ETS domain transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Together, this suggests a strong role of chromatin remodeling factors in suppressing BMAL1 gene expression in microglia. Finally, while we observed a very low expression, BMAL1 TF motifs were accessible in open chromatin landscape of microglia, which may lead to downstream gene-regulatory effects upon binding, even if BMAL1 expression is constitutively low. Overall, our results reveal low or absent expression of BMAL1 in microglia and point towards potential epigenetic mechanisms regulating its expression in these cells.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Here we characterise air space morphogenesis throughout the entirety of leaf development in the first leaf of A. thaliana and show that the plant hormone brassinosteroid (BR) is required for air space expansion in the palisade, but not the spongy, mesophyll. We also show that epidermal brassinosteroid perception is sufficient to promote air space expansion in the palisade non cell-autonomously and propose that this non cell-autonomous effect is due to altered epidermal growth. To test if epidermal growth affects air space patterning we reduce growth specifically in the epidermis using inducible expression of the growth repressor BIG BROTHER and show that an epidermal growth restriction reduces air space expansion in the palisade mesophyll.

This approach yields robust, tissue-specific deletion of C-LTMRs without off-target effects in non-sensory tissues.

Using reaction time analysis and a deep learning-based embedding of individual animals, we uncovered large but low-dimensional differences in behavioral traits. Some mice consistently exhibited anticipatory responses, marked by fast reaction times, while others showed slower, more disengaged behavior. These behavioral profiles were consistent across sessions, with female mice tending to show more anticipatory behavior than males. We hypothesized that this behavioral spectrum reflects differences in the depth of underlying cortical states, reflected in the temporal dynamics of neural activity. Supporting this idea, we found that the characteristic timescale of population activity, measured during both inter-trial intervals and passive periods, correlated with an animal's anticipatory tendency across cortical areas, especially in medial visual areas. These findings suggest that individual differences in the cortical dynamics may underlie distinct decision-making strategies.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of cellular and transcriptional dynamics in the mouse prostate following orchiectomy (ORX)-induced androgen deprivation.

Single-cell RNA sequencing uncovered a previously undescribed fibroblast subtype, termed ORX-induced fibroblast (OIF), characterized by high expression of Wnt2, Rorb, and Wif1, with distinct spatial localization. Pathway analysis revealed upregulation of amide and peptide binding functions, alongside suppression of peptidase and endopeptidase activity.

Treatment of tRCC currently lacks a clear standard of care, underscoring the pressing need to nominate new therapeutic targets with mechanistic rationale in this cancer. Experimental Design: In this study, we applied integrative genomic approaches to identify activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathways in tRCC. We tested the activity of CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), alone or in combination with mTORC1-selective inhibition, using in vitro and in vivo models of tRCC. Results: tRCC tumors displayed multiple genomic and transcriptional features associated with activation of the CDK4/6 and mTORC1 signaling pathways. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of CDK4/6 suppressed tRCC cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest in vitro but was not cytotoxic, with rapid cell regrowth observed after drug withdrawal. The mTORC1-selective inhibitor, RMC-5552, potently reduced translation of Cyclin D1, which complexes with CDK4/6 proteins to regulate G1-S cell cycle progression. Combined treatment with the CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, and RMC-5552 resulted in synergistic suppression of tRCC cell viability and increased markers of apoptosis in vitro. The combination of palbociclib and RMC-5552 in a tRCC xenograft model showed greater efficacy than either single agent while also being well-tolerated.

SIg-Mann switches binding from antigen to dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), known to be expressed on interfollicular macrophages and FL-associated follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). The interaction with DC-SIGN induces reorganization of sIg-Mann in wider and less dense clusters than anti-Ig, consistent with inefficient DC-SIGN-induced endocytosis and a low-level intracellular signaling. However, ligand-specific cell clusters form between sIg-Mann-expressing lymphoma and DC-SIGN-expressing cells, raising a need to understand the functional consequences of the interaction of DC-SIGN with sIg-Mann on primary FL cells. This engagement induces adhesion of FL cells to VCAM-1 via B-cell receptor proximal kinases and actin regulators in a fashion similar to anti-Ig, but without initiating apoptosis in vitro. Instead, antibody blockade of sIg-Mann contact with DC-SIGN expressed on FDC-derived YK6/SIGN cells inhibits adhesion and survival of primary FL cells in vitro. These data highlight that the specific interaction with DC-SIGN induces FL cell adhesion to VCAM-1, likely allowing FL cell retention in the lymph node, and survival of the FL cells.

Our prior work established that endothelial loss of Dicer1, a key enzyme in microRNA (miRNA) processing, drives AS formation in mice, indicating a tumor suppressive role for miRNAs in tumorigenesis. Here, we corroborated this hypothesis by generating a novel conditional knockout model targeting Dgcr8, a core component of the microprocessor complex required for pri-miRNA processing. Conditional deletion of Dgcr8 phenocopies Dicer1 loss, resulting in spontaneous AS formation and global loss of mature miRNAs. We further demonstrate that treatment with enoxacin (ENX), a repurposed antibiotic known to enhance miRNA processing, reduces viability, migration, and clonogenicity of AS cells. ENX increases the abundance of tumor-suppressive miRNAs and downregulates oncogenic pathways, including pathways related to cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, and cell migration. These results establish the essential role of miRNA biogenesis in suppressing AS and reveal a pharmacologically targetable vulnerability via ENX-mediated enhancement of miRNA expression in tumors.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

The liverwort Marchantia polymorpha (Marchantia) serves as a key model organism to study signaling pathways and to infer their evolution throughout the green lineage. Marchantia expresses key components of UV-B signaling, including the photoreceptor UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (MpUVR8), the WD40-repeat protein REPRESSOR OF UV-B PHOTOMORPHOGENESIS (MpRUP), the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 / SUPPRESSOR OF phyA-105 (MpCOP1/MpSPA), and the transcriptional regulator ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (MpHY5). Here, we show that MpUVR8 exists as a homodimer in its ground-state in vivo, then monomerizes and accumulates in the nucleus upon UV-B activation. Activated MpUVR8 interacts with MpCOP1, triggering growth inhibition, gene expression changes, biosynthesis of UV-absorbing metabolites, and photoprotection, which overall contributes to UV-B stress tolerance. MpRUP facilitates redimerization of MpUVR8 and Mprup null mutants show enhanced UV-B photomorphogenesis, indicating that MpRUP efficiently represses MpUVR8 signaling. Unlike the case in Arabidopsis and in contrast to the strong Mpcop1 mutant phenotype, Mpspa mutants develop only a weak constitutive photomorphogenesis phenotype, indicating that COP1 function is more independent of SPA in Marchantia than in Arabidopsis. Interestingly, however, Mpspa is linked with a hyper-responsive UV-B phenotype, suggesting that MpSPA is a negative regulator of MpUVR8 signaling. Our findings demonstrate that core components of UV-B signaling existed in the last common ancestor of extant land plants; however, regulatory interactions have diversified in different lineages since their divergence more than 400 million years ago.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

E.; Girn, M.; Kotler, S.; Mannino, M.; Huskey, R.", "abstract": "Consciousness spans a range of phenomenological experiences, from effortless immersion to disengaged monotony, yet how such phenomenology emerges from brain activity is not well understood. Flow, in particular, has drawn attention for its links to performance and wellbeing, but existing neural accounts rely on single-region or small-network analyses that overlook the brain's distributed and dynamic nature. Complexity science offers tools that capture whole-brain dynamics, but this approach has rarely been applied to flow or to its natural comparison states of boredom and frustration. Consequently, it remains unclear whether tools drawn from complexity science can objectively separate phenomenological experiences while also clarifying their neural basis. Here we show that a complexity science approach distinguishes flow from boredom and frustration. We induced each phenomenological experience with a difficulty-titrated video game during functional magnetic resonance imaging and collected concurrent behavioral and self-report data. Whole-brain analyses revealed that flow is marked by lower global entropy, higher dynamical agility, and decreased dynamical complexity, whereas boredom and frustration exhibit different configurations of brain-dynamics metrics. Notably, these findings integrate previously separate prefrontal, network-synchrony, and cerebellar observations within a single dynamical systems framework and identify complexity-based markers that map the neural correlates of media-related benefits.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Additionally, posterior low-beta activity has been proposed as a mechanism for processing incoming sensory stimuli in WM. However, it is unknown whether frontal midline theta activity and the N200 support mismatch detection, or whether posterior low-beta activity extends from sensory processing to detecting a mismatch between sensory input and the internal model. Here, we reveal that frontal midline theta supports mismatch detection and explains individual WM performance. Unexpectedly, instead of the N200, results show a positive slow wave ERP overlapping with the frontal midline theta mismatch response. Results additionally indicate a late posterior low-beta response persisting from stimulus presentation into the post-stimulus delay.

M.; Davidow, J. Y.", "abstract": "Adolescence is a period marked by profound changes in both capacities for learning and the motivational drives that guide behavior. Motivated learning, including the ability to associate cues with actions that lead to positive or negative outcomes, is a fundamental component of adaptive behavior and is essential for survival. Equally important is the encoding of events during learning, which may be influenced by the valence of outcomes. Given the substantial neurocognitive changes in motivated learning and memory that occur from childhood to adulthood, adolescence provides a unique window to investigate mechanisms of these adaptive behaviors. Yet, we know surprisingly little about the development of these behaviors, with sparse extant research fraught with inconsistent findings. In this study, we examined motivated learning and incidental memory using a validated affective learning task in a sample of 174 participants aged 8 to 25 years. The task orthogonalized action and outcome valence and included incidental encoding of trial-unique images presented during feedback, followed by a delayed memory test. We show that adolescents outperform both children and adults in learning by leveraging Pavlovian response biases. In contrast, children exhibit enhanced memory for stimuli associated with positive outcomes compared to adolescents and adults. These findings point to distinct developmental advantages: enhanced learning performance in adolescence and enhanced memory for rewarding events in childhood, each potentially adaptive at their respective developmental stages. Together, these findings suggest opportunities to leverage learning and memory in youth for practical applications, such as education and policy setting.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

We propose a gain-adaptive, recurrent sensory network model in which gains optimize a novel efficient-coding objective balancing accuracy and spiking cost. From the propagation of modulated gains throughout the network emerge quickly adaptive tuning curves. The model accounts for subtle adapter-repulsion effects under peaked priors and predicts fast prior attraction under broader distributions, for which we provide supporting behavioral evidence.

Mechanistically, mucosal memory is driven by proline catabolism via proline dehydrogenase (Prodh) in epithelial cells, which sustains mitochondrial function, epigenetic remodeling, and promotes cytokine production upon secondary challenge. Unlike classical trained immunity in immune cells, epithelial memory is independent of glycolysis but partially sustained by fatty acid oxidation via carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT1).

The broader transcriptional landscape and intercellular signaling networks underlying human myocarditis, particularly among non-immune cells, remain poorly understood. Methods: We performed integrated spatial transcriptomic profiling of 38 endomyocardial biopsy (EMBx) specimens using two complementary platforms: 10X Visium FFPE and GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP). The cohort included cases of histologically confirmed myocarditis, borderline myocarditis, and controls. For 10X Visium, data was refined by excluding leukocyte-enriched spots and enriching for cardiomyocyte-specific regions based on canonical marker expression. For GeoMx, immunohistochemistry-guided segmentation enabled targeted transcriptomic analysis of disparate cardiac cellular compartments. Differential gene expression was analyzed independently for each platform and subsequently integrated. These results were further leveraged to infer molecular interaction networks and ligand-receptor relationships in myocarditis relative to controls. Results: Both platforms revealed widespread gene expression changes consistent with immune activation in myocarditis and borderline myocarditis, particularly within cardiomyocyte-enriched regions. These included upregulation of HLA-A, HLA-DQA1, B2M, and CD74 in myocarditis, consistent with activation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and II related pathways. Molecular interaction analysis identified STAT1 and ISG15 as likely central immune signaling nodes. Ligand receptor inference highlighted HLA-A, HLA-E, and HLA-DQA1 as key receptor hubs interacting with immune ligands such as IFNG, CD8A, and several members of the (NK) killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that human myocarditis is characterized by widespread transcriptional dysregulation beyond immune cell foci, including upregulation of genes typically associated with professional antigen-presenting cells in cardiomyocytes.

Using mixed social and ecological methods, we assessed 53 green alleys' capacity to support biodiversity and provide ecosystem services, alongside 23 grey alleys and 76 streets. We interviewed residents to select the ecosystem services that were most relevant to people living around green alleys and then measured indicators of ecosystem service capacity with traditional ecological techniques, harnessing an interdisciplinary approach to ecosystem service assessment. Green alleys provided more biodiversity support than grey alleys and adjacent street segments but did not consistently increase the capacity for ecosystem services. Vegetative complexity and proportion of native tree species are both higher in green alleys than traditional grey alleys and adjacent streets. The proportion of flowering trees was one indicator of ecosystem services that was consistently higher in green alleys.

BEF relationships can have positive, neutral, or negative slopes, yet it remains unclear what conditions result in a particular slope. A popular classification in microbial ecology distinguishes  broad from  narrow functions and we ask whether this distinction improves predictions of BEF relationships. Specifically, we evaluate whether the relationships between broad functions and diversity can be predicted based on (1) the combined slopes from underlying narrow functions, (2) the phylogenetic breadth of associated species and (3) their ecological dominance. We assembled bacterial communities from pitcher plant fluid, using a dilution-to-extinction approach to create a gradient in biodiversity. Darlingtonia californica are carnivorous plants that depend on their bacterial community to degrade insects that supplement their nitrogen requirements. We found a negative BEF relationship between bacterial richness and degradation, while narrow functions had positive and neutral BEF slopes. The narrow functions did not predict the BEF relationship for the broader function. We identified three species statistically associated with degradation: Clostridium sp. had a positive association, while Herbinix sp. and Dyadobacter sp. had negative associations. Clostridium sp. was rare in the dataset and negatively correlated with Herbinix sp., suggesting an antagonism and highlighting important functional contributions of subordinate species. We propose that the negative BEF for degradation is explained by rare key functional taxa that thrive in low-diversity communities.

Yet, little is known about the effects of flow intermittence and associated hydrological connectivity on the resilience capacity of instream communities, and the ecosystem functions they perform. We expected lower resilience capacity in non-perennial and isolated reaches. Here, we used fish and invertebrate community data and litter decomposition rates across 20 sites in a river network naturally fragmented by drying to characterize the drivers of resilience at the river-network scale. Using discontinuity analysis, a set of resilience indicators were calculated from body size distribution and species traits, and related to flow intermittence, network fragmentation and position in the stream network. We found that non-perennial reaches were characterized by lower resilience with fewer species, lower levels of functional redundancy of five out of eight functional feeding groups. Functional redundancy and response diversity in shredders were decoupled, translating into low litter decomposition rates in non-perennial reaches. Upstream reaches were characterized by low community resilience, likely reflecting their isolated position in the river network, but flow intermittence affected more strongly the resilience of downstream than upstream reaches. Cross-scale functional redundancy and grazer response diversity were driven by network fragmentation, meaning that the functions these groups perform might be at risk when facing other anthropogenic pressures.

Current hemostatic therapies rely on plasma-derived products, but these are limited by logistical constraints and infectious risk. Here we report a recombinant protein-based hemostat that integrates biophysical design principles with clot-targeted drug delivery. We produced enzyme-responsive glutamine (Q)-containing block elastin-like polypeptides (Q-block-ELPs) that reinforce fibrin clots through phase separation and covalent cross-linking. Q-block-ELPs incorporate glutamine residues within a peptide motif recognized by coagulation factor XIIIa, enabling site-specific grafting into fibrin networks during clot formation. By tuning polymer length, Q-block valency, and lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior, we engineered Q-block-ELPs to phase separate at body temperature and integrate into the fibrin architecture. In vitro, Q-block-ELPs increase fibrin network density and stiffness. In a thrombocytopenic mouse model, systemic administration reduced blood loss and accelerated clot formation. This platform combines self-assembly with specific enzyme responsiveness to enhance clot mechanics and holds translational potential as a systemic hemostatic therapy in platelet-deficient bleeding disorders.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

G.; Wu, Y.", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Background: Interstitial myocardial fibrosis is a crucial pathological feature of many cardiovascular disorders. Myocardial fibrosis resulting in extracellular volume (ECV) expansion can be non-invasively quantified by cardiac MRI (CMR) with T1 mapping before and after gadolinium (Gd) contrast agent administration. However, longitudinal repetitive ECV measurements are challenging in rodents due to the prolonged scan time with cardiac and respiratory gating that is required for conventional T1 mapping and the invasive nature of the rodent intravenous lines. Methods: To address these challenges, the objective of this study is to establish a fast, free-breathing, and gating-free ECV procedure with a non-invasive subcutaneous catheter for in-scanner Gd administration that can allow longitudinal repetitive ECV evaluations in rodent models. This is achieved by (1) IntraGate sequence for free-breathing gating-free cardiac imaging, (2) non-invasive subcutaneous in-scanner Gd administration, and (3) fast T1 mapping with varied flip angle (VFA) in conjunction with (4) triple jugular vein blood T1 normalization. Additionally, full cine CMR (multi-slice short-axis, long-axis 2-chamber, and long-axis 4-chamber) was acquired during the waiting period for comprehensive systolic cardiac functional and strain analysis. Results: We have successfully established a non-invasive fast ECV quantification protocol to enable longitudinal repetitive ECV quantifications in rodents. Non-invasive subcutaneous Gd bolus administration induced reasonable dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) time course reaching a steady state in ~ 20 min for stable T1 quantification. The free-breathing gating-free VFA T1 quantification scheme allows for rapid cardiac (~2.5 min) and jugular vein (49 sec) T1 quantification with no motion artifacts. The triple jugular vein T1 acquisitions (1 pre-contrast and 2 post-contrast) immediately flanking the heart T1 acquisitions enable accurate myocardial ECV quantification. Our data demonstrated that left-ventricular myocardial ECV quantifications were highly reproducible with repeated scans, and the ECV values (0.25) are comparable to reported ranges among humans and rodents. This protocol was successfully applied to ischemic reperfusion injury model to detect myocardial fibrosis that was validated with histopathology. Conclusion: We have established a simple, fast, non-invasive, and robust CMR protocol in rodents that can enable longitudinal repetitive ECV quantifications for cardiovascular disease progression. It can be used to monitor disease regression with interventions.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

The molecular basis of its wider heavy-metal resilience, particularly among the 1017 out of 4128 proteins still annotated as hypothetical, remains unclear. We performed a proteome-wide structural and functional survey to address this gap. All the 4128 proteins were modeled with AlphaFold2, yielding very-high-confidence structures (pLDDT [&ge;] 90) for 2145 sequences. CATH/InterPro analysis assigned domains to 2735 proteins. Functions were predicted by combining DeepFRI (graph neural-network), MorphologFinder (Foldseek plus EggNOG-Mapper), and existing GenBank annotations. The integrated workflow suggests that more than 100 previously uncharacterized proteins may bind or transport arsenic, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, or zinc, indicating a metal-handling capacity that extends beyond the known ars operon. Recurrent domain architectures that include P-loop NTPases, Rossmann folds, GNAT acetyl-transferases, and sensor modules (CHASE, PAS, GAF) point to coordinated redox regulation and efflux pathways.

There is an ever-expanding number of bacterial taxa being discovered, but many of these taxa remain uncharacterized with unknown traits and environmental preferences. This diversity makes it challenging to interpret ecological patterns in microbiomes and understand why individual taxa, or assemblages, may vary across space and time. While we can use information from the rapidly growing databases of bacterial genomes to infer traits, we still need an approach to organize what we know, or think we know, about bacterial taxa to match taxonomic and phylogenetic information to trait inferences. Inspired by the periodic table of the elements, we have constructed a 'periodic table' of bacterial taxa to organize and visualize monophyletic groups of bacteria based on the distributions of key traits predicted from genomic data. By analyzing 50,745 genomes across 31 bacterial phyla, we used the Haar-like wavelet transformation, a model-free transformation of trait data, to identify clades of bacteria which are nearly uniform with respect to six selected traits - oxygen tolerance, autotrophy, chlorophototrophy, maximum potential growth rate, GC content and genome size. The identified functionally uniform clades of bacteria are presented in a concise 'periodic table'-like format to facilitate identification and exploration of bacterial lineages in trait space. While our approach could be improved and expanded in the future, we demonstrate its utility for integrating phylogenetic information with genome-derived trait values to improve our understanding of the bacterial diversity found in environmental and host-associated microbiomes.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

In this study, we present SVPG, an approach that leverages haplotype-resolved pangenome reference for accurate SV detection and rapid pangenome graph augmentation from long-read sequencing data. Compared to state-of-the-art SV callers, SVPG maintained superior overall performance across different coverages and sequencing technologies. SVPG also achieves notable improvements in calling rare and individual-specific SVs on both simulated and real somatic datasets.

Both microbial communities and their hosts have circadian rhythms and are subject to diurnal environmental changes.

Here, we exploit paired sequencing data of host transcriptome and microbiome derived maize genotypes in field conditions and under two contrasting diurnal periods. Gene expression patterns of circadian cycle genes confirmed expected diurnal dynamics. Groups of co-expressed genes that responded to diurnal periods were associated with nucleic acid-binding, heat stress responses, and photosynthesis. Microbiome analysis revealed only modest differences in alpha diversity between midday and midnight samples. However, beta diversity indicated a significant shift in community composition. Co-occurrence network analysis identified keystone taxa specific to each time point, suggesting time-dependent ecological roles within the phyllosphere microbiome. Cross-correlation analyses between host gene expression and bacterial taxon abundance revealed a greater number of host-microbe associations during the night. Several maize genes involved in circadian regulation significantly correlated with microbial taxa.

However, these perspectives often overlook the structural organization of functional tissue units (FTUs), the small, repeating structures which are crucial to tissue function and key factors during pathological assessment. The incorporation of FTU information is hindered by the need for detailed manual annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. While artificial intelligence (AI)-based solutions hold great promise to accelerate this process, there is currently no comprehensive workflow for building the large, annotated cohorts required. To remove these roadblocks and advance the development of more interpretable approaches, we developed MiroSCOPE, an end-to-end AI-assisted platform for annotating FTUs at scale, built on QuPath. MiroSCOPE integrates a fine-tunable multiclass segmentation model and curation-specific usability features to enable a human-in-the-loop system that accelerates AI annotation by a pathologist. The system is used to efficiently annotate over 71,900 FTUs on 184 prostate cancer hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue samples and demonstrates ready translation to breast cancer. Furthermore, we publicly release a dataset named Miro-120, consisting of 120 prostate cancer H&E with 30,568 annotations, which can be used by the community as a high-quality resource for FTU-level machine learning aims.

It is often hypothesized that cell-substrate friction can impact biofilm growth and development on these disparate surfaces. However, the experimental difficulty in measuring the friction between a biofilm and its surface has limited our understanding of how friction forces impact emergent colony-level behaviors and morphologies. Here, we demonstrate that increasing cell-substrate friction increases the biofilm contact angle, which, in turn, decreases the horizontal biofilm range expansion rate. We first used individual-based simulations to isolate the impact of friction. In this simple model, we found that increasing friction increases biofilm contact angle, and, in turn, that the contact angle emerges from a simple dynamic force balance between cell-substrate friction, cell-cell steric forces, and cell-cell adhesion, reminiscent of Young's equation for sessile liquid drops. We developed an approach to directly measure the friction between bacterial colonies and agar surfaces, and found that the friction between the substrate and the biofilm is higher on substrates made with higher agar weight percentage. Additionally, we observed that biofilm contact angles increase with friction, following a Young-equation-like balance. Finally, we found that contact angle increases with agar percentage for a wide range of bacteria, suggesting that the biophysical impact of friction may play a role for a wide array of microbes.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Transforming growth factor beta; (TGF beta) is a canonical CAF activator. This study aims to identify TGF beta-induced secreted mediators that reinforce the myCAF phenotype in breast cancer and map the downstream signaling cascade. Methods and Results: Secretome profiling of primary patient-derived myCAFs and human mammary fibroblasts (HMF3s) engineered to over-express TGF beta1 revealed 20 extracellular matrix remodelers shared exclusively by both activated states; lysyl oxidase (LOX) was the top-ranked hit. LOX knockdown abrogated TGF beta driven alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA) induction, collagen gel contraction and migration in HMF3s, and reduced constitutive alpha SMA and beta catenin in myCAFs. Mechanistically, TGF beta; upregulated LOX, which activated focal adhesion kinase (FAK), leading to p38 MAPK- and Akt-mediated Ser9 phosphorylation (inactivation) of GSK3 beta; and consequent beta catenin stabilization. In HCC1806-luciferase orthotopic xenografts, CAFs accelerated tumor growth, whereas LOX-deficient CAFs lost this pro-tumoral effect. Conclusion: LOX is a pivotal autocrine effector of TGF beta; that locks breast CAFs into a pro-tumoral myCAF state via a LOX/FAK/GSK3beta/beta catenin axis.

Estuaries are priority areas due to their socio-ecological importance; however, they are at risk due to climate change and anthropogenic impacts. Bivalves are abundant in estuarine soft-bottoms and their remains may be valuable environmental indicators, since the biotic (e.g., life habits, mineral composition) and abiotic characteristics (e.g., tides or topography) lead to differences in the accumulation and preservation of their shells. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the accumulation and taphonomic aspects of modern shells of the stout razor clam Tagelus plebeius in relation to the topographic characteristics of intertidal areas in Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (Buenos Aires, Argentina). The results would indicate remains transport to the intertidal areas with a low-energy dynamic. The topographic characteristics of the beaches combined with the pattern of shell accumulation, suggested that the remains transport is not due directly to topography but to a combination of factors. In fact, those factors related to beach localization with respect to the main water flow direction and hydrodynamics would be more relevant. Furthermore, the findings showed that the taphonomic attributes of deposited modern shells may indicate environmental characteristics, such as energy of transport, submersion time or predation pressure.

A critical driver of this process is the activation of macrophages, which secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to immune cell recruitment and collagen deposition by myofibroblasts. Agonizing the cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2), expressed on macrophages, offers a potential therapeutic avenue to suppress this activation. Despite widespread interest in CB2 modulation, challenges remain in the development of small molecule agonists, including insufficient specificity and poor drug-like properties. Antibodies are highly specific with favorable pharmacokinetics and bioavailability, but GPCR agonist antibodies have been difficult to discover. Here we present first-in-class CB2 agonist antibodies, AB120 and AB150.

Furthermore, using an ex vivo human precision-cut liver slice (hPCLS) model of liver fibrosis, we observe that treatment with these CB2 agonist antibodies not only reduces inflammatory markers but also significantly decreases collagen expression, indicating a potential to halt or reverse fibrosis.

Accordingly, we exposed C57BL/6J male adult mice to filtered air (FA), 1 ppm O3, or 1.5 ppm O3 for 3 hours. As compared to FA-exposed mice, O3-exposed mice exhibited increased recruitment of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in the lung airspaces, which was consistent with the elevated levels of macrophage- and neutrophil-specific chemokines, i.e., MIP-2, MCP-3, and MCP-5. Next, to profile AM transcriptome from O3-exposed mice and understand the relevance of these transcriptomic changes in relation to their population heterogeneity and functionality, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analyses on AM population identified significant changes in 1 ppm-exposed and 1.5 ppm O3-exposed mice. As compared to AMs from FA-exposed group, AMs from 1 ppm O3- and 1.5 ppm O3-exposed groups displayed enrichment of pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, EIF2 signaling, and non-canonical NF-kB signaling. Furthermore, AMs from 1 ppm O3-exposed mice showed enrichment of IL-10 signaling pathway. On the other hand, AMs from 1.5 ppm O3-exposed mice were uniquely enriched in DNA damage bypass and repair pathways. Interestingly, UMAP analyses on annotated AMs resulted in five distinct subclusters. DEGs and ingenuity pathways (IP) analyses on each subcluster revealed O3 concentration-dependent enrichment of pathways relevant to protein translation, cholesterol biosynthesis and mitochondrial biogenesis. Further analyses revealed that O3 exposure results in cluster-specific alterations to the expression of gene signatures associated with macrophage activation.

However, the relative contributions of heritable and non-heritable factors remain unclear for most immune phenotypes. We used populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) with heritable differences in immune function to investigate the relationship between immunity, genetic divergence, and the environment. Fish were raised in tanks with different flow rates (continuous or intermittent) that harbored differing microbial communities. After long-term acclimation to one tank environment, a subset of adult fish were moved to the alternate flow regime and allowed to acclimate for eighteen weeks. We then measured the effects of starting environment, transfer between environments, and final environment across several immune parameters. Both population and treatment significantly affected immune function. Sticklebacks from a population previously found to display the highest heritable levels of innate immunity displayed the highest oxidative burst capacity (ROS) regardless of tank environment. However, all fish in intermittent flow tanks (both resident and transfers) tended to have higher ROS production, more granulocytes, and greater spleen mass than in continuous flow. Variation in liver mass was mainly driven by population effects. Together, this work demonstrates that a simple change in water flow dynamics can shift aquarium microbial conditions, creating opportunities to explore immune flexibility. Perhaps more importantly, we also highlight the need for further research examining how naturally evolved genetic differences and environmental factors individually and jointly influence the magnitude and direction of immune responses.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Most molecular design methods follow target-based drug discovery paradigms that rely on well-defined drug targets, thereby limiting their applicability to diseases lacking known targets or reference compounds.

Cell morphology offers the guidance on desired bioactivity-relevant phenotypic effects, while textual descriptions provide direct and interpretable cues about molecular structure. Leveraging complementary structural and bioactivity context, MGMG significantly enhances molecule generation performance, especially in scenarios where textual descriptions are under-informative or morphological signals are weak. MGMG can also be applied to genetic perturbations, enabling activator design from gene overexpression morphology without requiring knowledge of reference compound structure. In addition, in silico docking demonstrates that MGMG-generated molecules, despite lacking target information, exhibit binding affinities comparable to reference compounds, preserving key interactions while introducing structural diversity. Overall, MGMG jointly utilizes morphological and textual description inputs to guide molecule generation, enabling diverse, bioactivity-aware compound design in a target-agnostic fashion.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we used GLORI-sequencing to establish the first transcriptome-wide, single-nucleotide resolution maps of m6A in cancer. Differentially methylated transcripts were enriched in oncogenic pathways relevant to UCB. We discovered two key m6A signatures in UCB: a global loss of methylation and a local hypermethylation at 3'-UTRs. Integration of RNA-sequencing data revealed that the global loss resulted from dilution of methylation marks due to increased expression of unmethylated transcripts and decreased expression of highly methylated transcripts. In contrast, local 3'-UTR hypermethylation was associated with the overexpression of VIRMA, a component of the m6A writer complex, which was linked to UCB progression.

Here, we investigated whether the thermogenic potential of NMR brown adipose tissue and its UCP1 differ from those in mice and whether the lack of thermal insulation causes extreme changes in NMR body temperature upon cold exposure. Through longitudinal molecular, thermal, metabolic, and behavioral measurements, we found that NMRs initiated non-shivering thermogenesis and elevated body temperature but could not sustain it due to excessive heat loss and limits to substrate availability. Our results suggest that NMRs represent a unique thermoregulatory category that doesn't fit neatly into traditional classifications. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that the NMR UCP1 is functional and can be activated and inhibited as expected for most other mammals. We further demonstrated that artificial insulation can partially restore thermoregulatory capabilities in NMRs. This study employs an advanced methodology to characterize the thermal biology of NMRs and helps resolve a long-standing controversy in the field.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

In parallel, we monitored the expression of CXCR4, a GPCR upregulated during axonal regeneration, and tested whether its pharmacological activation could mitigate ALS-related functional decline. We found that NMJ regenerative capacity is largely preserved during pre- and early symptomatic stages, and remains active in subsets of NMJs even at later stages. CXCR4 is expressed at axon terminals from early disease stages, declining only at end stage. Its expression is conserved across ALS models, including SOD1G93A pigs, hiPSC-derived MN with ALS mutations, and biopsies from sporadic ALS patients. CXCR4 stimulation improved motor function, NMJ innervation, MN survival, and respiratory performance in ALS mice, and axon outgrowth in iPSC-derived MN.

In search of genetic determinants that may underly the commensal lifestyle of the low-virulent C. albicans isolate 101, we identified a small sequence duplication in one of the BRG1 allele resulting in a truncated loss-of-function allele (BRG1TRUNC). Replacing BRG1TRUNC by the full-length allele (BRG1FL) resulted in a modest increase in filamentation, but did not alter the phenotype of the fungus in the oral mucosa of experimentally colonized mice. Spontaneous outgrowth of highly virulent variants of the 101 strain with the BRG1TRUNC alleles replaced by a full-length allele identified the Cyr1-cAMP-PKA signalling pathway as a modulator of fungal virulence. Although the Glu-to-Lys mutation in CYR1 (CYR1E1541K), which converts Cyr1 into a hyperactive adenylate cyclase, greatly increased filamentation, the expression of hyphae-associated genes, and host cell damage when tested in vitro, it was insufficient to increase virulence of C. albicans strain 101 in the oral mucosa in vivo, irrespective of the BRG1 status.

Among the six orthologs of eIF4E in Leishmania, LeishIF4E1 is intriguing, as it does not bind any Leishmania eIF4G. It is expressed in both life-forms, maintaining efficient cap-binding activity for translation initiation, unlike other LeishIF4Es. We identified two novel phosphorylation sites specifically S108, and S112, along with S203, which is conserved with the mammalian phosphorylation site. A non-phosphorylatable, tagged, mutant of LeishIF4E1 created by substituting the phosphorylated serine residues with alanine [S(108,112,203)A] was generated. The phosphorylation status did not affect the binding of LeishIF4E1 to translation initiation factors. However, the phosphorylated LeishIF4E1 interacted with proteins involved in DNA and chromatin structure, while non-phosphorylated LeishIF4E1 interacted with proteins that assist cells under stress and unfavorable conditions, particularly in gluconeogenesis. This indicates that LeishIF4E1 may play secondary regulatory roles. RNA sequencing of transcripts associated with LeishIF4E1 showed a tenfold decrease in binding to the non-phosphorylated form, highlighting the significance of its phosphorylation in transcript interaction.

Our study reveals the critical role of the pathway from posterior amygdala cells expressing estrogen receptor alpha (PAEsr1) to the ventrolateral part of ventromedial hypothalamus cells expressing neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (VMHvlNpy2r) in the rise and fall of maternal aggression. Functional manipulations and recordings demonstrate that VMHvl-projecting PAEsr1 (PAEsr1[-&gt;]VMHvl) cells are naturally active and required for maternal aggression. During lactation, PA-VMHvlNpy2r connection strengthens, and VMHvlNpy2r excitability increases to facilitate attack. Furthermore, PAEsr1 expresses abundant oxytocin receptors, enabling oxytocin to boost PAEsr1 cell output. After pup separation, the oxytocin level drops, causing decreased maternal aggression, which can be restored by optogenetically increasing the oxytocin level. Thus, diverse forms of plasticity occur at the PAEsr1-VMHvlNpy2r circuit to support need-based maternal aggression.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

White adipogenesis protects against lipotoxicity, influencing insulin resistance and obesity-related comorbidities. Brown adipogenesis enhances energy expenditure, thereby counteracting weight gain, lipotoxicity and insulin resistance. Recently, there has been a significant increase in interest regarding adipocyte differentiation, mainly focusing on the interplay between microRNAs (miRNAs) and the transcriptional cascade that governs adipogenesis and metabolic dysfunction. This study aimed to identify miRNAs regulating white and brown adipocyte differentiation and define miRNA action in a stem cell model of adipogenesis. Methods Small RNAseq analysis of primary mouse brown and white adipocytes (WAs) identified miR-10b to be upregulated in mature brown adipocytes (BAs). We generated two model systems: 1) immortalized brown pre-adipocytes treated with miRNA inhibitors and 2) CRISPR/Cas9 KO of miR-10b in E14 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Both cell models were differentiated into mature adipocytes. To unravel the pathways that are affected by miR-10b depletion, a transcriptomic analysis was performed at key time points. Results Both cell models showed that miR-10b-5p depletion severely impaired differentiation into mature adipocytes, as indicated by a lack of lipid droplet formation and reduced adipogenic gene expression. Gene expression analysis supports that miR-10b-5p directs embryonic stem (ES) cells towards the mesoderm lineage, promoting commitment to pre-adipocytes by downregulating Gata6 and its downstream target Bmp2. This mechanism appears to be unaffected in BAs. Our study demonstrated that miR-10b-5p regulates the later stages of adipogenesis, at least in part, by downregulating Tub, a direct target of miR-10b-5p. We also confirmed that miR-10b-5p alleviated the halted differentiation phenotypes of adipocytes by supressing the G Protein Signalling pathway mediated by Tubby. Conclusions These results evidence that miR-10b inhibition plays a dynamic role in adipocyte biology, as its inhibitory effects manifest differently during the stem cell preadipocyte proliferation state and during the maturation phase of adipocytes. Collectively, our study demonstrated that miR-10b-5p may represent a new potential therapeutic target for lipodystrophy and obesity.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Benzimidazole resistance is linked to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the {beta}-tubulin isotype-1 gene; however, the {beta}-tubulin genes of U. stenocephala have not been fully characterised. We aimed to identify {beta}-tubulin genes and confirm the coding sequences for key residues (Q134, F167, E198, and F200) in the {beta}-tubulin isotype-1 gene of the U. stenocephala genome. Two U. stenocephala specimens were subjected to Illumina sequencing, and species identity was confirmed through morphological and molecular analysis using ITS rDNA and cox-1 markers.

Given the growing number of proteins/NA predicted to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), efficient tools to investigate this behavior are critical to advancing our understanding of biomolecular condensate function. The current standard used to study LLPS involves techniques that utilize exogenous fluorophore labels. The labeling process is often costly and time-consuming and comes with associated complexity that arises from unknown interactions from the bulky fluorescent tags. These aspects limit high throughput analysis of protein/NA phase separation based on external fluorophore labeling. Here, we report the discovery that intrinsic fluorescence, well into the visible spectrum, arises as an emergent property of biomolecular condensates. Leveraging this intrinsic fluorescence, we study condensate formation, directly measure their internal dynamics via Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP), and examine the 3D morphology and transitions to various multiphase architectures. Through this approach, we find that a variety of G-quadruplex DNA readily form droplets with histone H1 and display dynamic exchange. In addition, we directly demonstrate that the 3D morphology, core-shell architecture, and sub-compartmentalization of condensate droplets are tunable via the charge ratio of components in solution and NA hybridization.

Here, we have studied the roles of Ca-alphaT and Slowpoke ion channels in a Drosophila melanogaster glioblastoma model. Although their mammalian orthologs have been implicated in glioblastoma cell viability in vitro, their oncogenic potential remains uncharacterized in a complex in vivo context. Results: We show that glial-specific RNAi targeting Ca-alpha1T and Slowpoke in gliomas reduces glioma cell number and membrane extension and decreases glioma cell calcium activity and downstream activation of PI3K and pRIII/pERK signaling. Moreover, Slowpoke knockdown significantly extends glioma fly survival to near-control values and improves glioma-associated neurodegeneration. RNAseq transcriptomic analysis reveals shared regulation by both channels of pathways involved in metabolic rewiring, cell adhesion and excitatory neurotransmission, while uncovering distinct effects on synaptic function. Conclusions: Both Ca-alpha1T and Slowpoke are essential for pro-tumorigenic calcium-dependent signaling in Drosophila gliomas. Common effects observed upon gene knockdown support a coordinated function for these channels at the plasma membrane. Nevertheless, their distinct impacts on survival and gene expression profiles highlight non-redundant roles. Notably, Slowpoke knockdown promotes increased survival and neuroprotection, associated with the repression of synaptic genes aberrantly upregulated in gliomas, thereby identifying Slowpoke as a promising therapeutic target in glioblastoma.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

However, linking the molecular identity of neurons to circuit architecture remains a key challenge. Here, we present a high-resolution developmental transcriptional atlas for the Drosophila melanogaster nerve cord, the central hub for sensory-motor circuits. With an unprecedented 38x coverage, this atlas enabled robust alignment to the adult connectome. We found that birth time sets a discrete versus continuous organisation of neuronal molecular identity, a difference we also identified in the connectome. We discovered a set of 17 transcription factors expressed in a conserved temporal sequence across all lineages, establishing a global temporal code for neuronal identity based on birth order, linking specification to differentiation across the nerve cord. Lastly, by mapping sex-specific transcriptional profiles to the connectome, we uncovered apoptosis and transcriptional divergence as key drivers for sex-specification.

The dACC regulates expression of fear and pain, and its dysfunction is implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Compared to more recently specialized neocortical areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), the dACC is evolutionarily older. The region's agranular structure, and other evolutionary specializations, such as the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs), contribute to its specialized roles in cognitive and emotional processing. Here, we generated paired spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from adjacent tissue sections of the dACC in ten adult neurotypical donors to define molecular profiles for dACC cell types and spatial domains. Using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), we integrated these data by identifying gene expression patterns within the snRNA-seq data, which were projected onto the SRT data to infer the spatial localization. Combining these data with publicly available resources, we revealed insights about molecular profiles, spatial topography, enrichment of disease risk, and putative connectivity of spatially-localized dACC cell types, including VENs. Utilizing published dlPFC snRNA-seq and SRT data collected in the same neurotypical brain donors used here, we deployed cross-region comparison analyses between dACC and dlPFC to understand spatio-molecular specializations and laminar organization across human brain evolution. To make this comprehensive molecular resource accessible to the scientific community, we made both raw and processed data freely available, including through interactive web applications.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Climbing plants have independently evolved thousands of times and are particularly successful in tropical forests, yet their anatomical and evolutionary distinctiveness remains poorly understood. Among the most striking innovations in woody climbers--or lianas--are vascular variants: modifications to xylem and phloem that depart from the typical growth found in trees and shrubs. In this work, we leverage the fourth largest lineage of neotropical lianas, Paullinieae (Sapindaceae), to elucidate the evolution of development of vascular variants, and to test key innovation hypotheses in this megadiverse group. We reconstruct the largest phylogeny of any liana lineage to date (227 species, 351 nuclear genes), revealing a rapid radiation in the Miocene. Our anatomical evaluation of 462 species uncovered six patterns of vascular variants spanning three developmental categories--procambial, cambial, and ectopic cambia--which evolved repeatedly across the tree. Using stochastic mapping and a developmental complexity framework, we show that evolutionary transitions from typical growth disproportionately favored developmentally simple variants, suggesting that developmental accessibility constrains macroevolutionary trajectories. Despite the temporal overlap between the disparification of vascular variants, and the diversification rate shift, we find no evidence that vascular variants alone drive species diversification. Instead, diversification rates correlate with the presence of tendrils, climbing growth forms, and zygomorphic flowers. These results suggest a synnovation--a suite of synergistic innovations rather than a single trait--as the driver of lineage radiation in Paullinieae. Our study highlights how integrating phylogenomics, developmental anatomy, and trait evolution can illuminate the evolutionary mechanisms shaping plant diversity.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

S.; Alam, P.", "abstract": "In this paper,we consider the feasibility of mimicking the sprawling gait of a live varanid (Varanus salvator) using a necrobot (named: Pak Biawak), a robot constructed using the skeletal parts of a deceased varanid of the same species. Pak Biawak is manufactured using simple joints and components, and limb motion is coupled to passive spine bending to enable the sprawling gait. Here, we assess both the lateral and dorsal kinematics of Pak Biawak at different speeds, and compare the metrics from each to those of a similarly sized live varanid. When assessing lateral view shape metrics (stride aspect ratio, stride circularity, normalised stride swept area, normalised stride swept area perimeter), we find that Pak Biawak's gait is consistent across all speeds and the majority of Pak Biawak's lateral shape metrics are kinematically aligned with those of the live varanid. This also proves true when comparing Pak Biawak's lateral trajectory metrics (radial distance of swept area, normallised root mean squared error) against those of the live varanid, and at different speeds of sprawling. Pak Biawak's dorsal metrics include the spine bending amplitude and period, and these are not found to be significantly different to those of the live varanid, however, Pak Biawak's amplitude is affected by sprawling speed. We use three metrics to compare forward and reverse limb sweeps including, angular curvature, differential curvature, and a normalised arc length. Of these, a preponderance of highly significant differences (p < 0.001) are observed on comparing the forward sweep arc length of Pak Biawak at every sprawling speed against the forward sweep arc length of the live lizard. All other kinematic metrics in the necrobot are nevertheless very close to those of the live lizard. Finally, when comparing the trackway width of Pak Biawak against the live lizard, we again find there is very close kinematic compatibility between the two, and conclude that our necrobot can be designed and manufactured to mimic the sprawling gait of a real varanid, even when using simple kinematic linkages in unison with a passive spine bending differential applied at only one central location in the necrobot spine.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

In this study, we computationally examine cell-cell signaling and transcriptional activity using single-cell RNA sequencing of lung cancer treated by inhibiting methyltransferase EZH2. We show that EZH2 inhibition shifts the TME to immunogenic signaling patterns conducive to increased T cell response, including antigen presentation and homing.

Its complexity and high data dimensionality make it challenging to link specific exposure combinations to adverse health outcomes. Establishing relevant exposome criteria is key to addressing current knowledge gaps. This study evaluated contaminant levels in Wisconsin groundwater and their effects on host health. We focused on three co-occurring chemicals that were detected at concentrations exceeding groundwater standards, nitrate, atrazine and imidacloprid, and the emerging contaminant, microplastics. In this study, broilers were exposed to a low dose chemical mixture (35,000 ppb nitrate + 1.7 ppb atrazine + 0.58 ppb imidacloprid) and high dose chemical mixture (100,000 ppb nitrate + 3,000 ppb atrazine + 3,000 ppb imidacloprid) or polyethylene microplastics (PE MPs) for 49 days. We observed that both ternary mixtures and PE fiber MPs significantly altered the cecal microbiomes as determined by the enrichment of genera, Fournierella, Ruminococcus and an unclassified genus in the family Coriobacteriaceae. In addition, +PE fiber presence dysregulated metabolic pathways associated with bile acid biosynthesis and lipid metabolism. Similarly, perturbations to cecal microbial activity for both ternary chemical mixtures were confirmed via modulation of six metabolites including methylisopelletierine which had a higher total ion intensity than the control group. Interestingly, there were no detectable pathological effects to either the +PE fiber or ternary mixture treatment groups. Overall, the data presented here demonstrates that low doses of environmental contaminants are sufficient to dysregulate cecal taxonomic composition and microbial activity without inducing detectable pathological effects.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

This study investigates the underlying pathology in 28 non hospitalized subjects who reported persistent taste disturbances for over 12 months after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. To assess taste function, subjects completed the Waterless Empirical Taste Test (WETT), which quantifies the subject's ability to taste each of the five human taste qualities: sweet, umami, bitter, sour, and salty. Biopsies of fungiform papillae were collected from 20 participants and analyzed histologically for overall taste bud structure and innervation and by quantitative PCR (qPCR) for expression of markers for different taste receptor cells (TRCs). Although all subjects reported subjective taste dysfunction, only five scored below the 20th percentile on overall taste sensitivity. However, 12 subjects exhibited total loss of one or more taste qualities and another 13 subjects tested below the 95% confidence interval for at least one taste modality. Notably, loss of sweet, umami, or bitter tastes - qualities mediated by a PLC{beta}2-transduction cascade - was significantly more common than loss of sour and salty, and this loss correlated with reduced expression of PLC{beta}2 mRNA. Histological analysis revealed generally preserved taste bud structure and innervation in all cases, with occasional disorganization resulting in isolated PLC{beta}2-immunoreactive cells. Our findings suggest long term taste dysfunction after COVID-19 disproportionately impacts PLC{beta}2-dependent taste 38 qualities and is not due to widespread structural damage of the taste periphery.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Using small domains such as the RBD as vaccine immunogens, however, may constrain the availability of CD4 T follicular helper (TFH) cells and impact immunogenicity. We engineered a novel chimeric trimeric RBD (CTR) glycoprotein, replacing the RBD of human coronavirus HKU-1 spike with SARS-CoV-2 RBD of either ancestral (WT) or Omicron BA.2 strains. This strategy maintains a native trimeric conformation of the RBD, while providing additional sources of CD4 T cell help via the HKU-1 spike scaffold. In C57BL/6 mice, CTR-BA.2 prime-boost vaccination elicited high anti-BA.2-RBD IgG and neutralising titres, matching responses in animals immunised with native SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. GC B cells elicited by CTR-BA.2 were predominantly WT+/BA.2+ cross-reactive, and TFH cells predominantly recognised HKU-1 epitopes, demonstrating scaffold-directed T cell help. Macaques prime-boost immunised with CTR-WT similarly elicited high anti-RBD IgG, anti-spike IgG and neutralising responses, comparable to native spike-vaccinated animals. In draining lymph nodes of CTR-WT vaccinated macaques, RBD-specific GC B cells were present at elevated levels. In contrast to the murine studies, lymph node-draining TFH responses in macaques were broadly elicited against RBD, NTD/S2 or HKU-1-derived peptides. Although native SARS-CoV-2 spike was also highly immunogenic in animal models, our findings establish the chimeric glycoprotein design as a strategy to overcome the poor immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD by engaging CD4 TFH cells, while maintaining the ability to elicit protective neutralising responses.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Oxidative stress analysis confirmed that PCC samples had significantly higher levels of DNA damage (8-OHdG) than the convalescent group, whereas antioxidant markers, such as reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG), were significantly lower in PCC samples than in uninfected controls.

Here we characterized a clinical MDR isolate Shigella sonnei HK8, a.k.a. PD552A, whose genome contains key resistance (gyrA, PBP3) and virulence (icsA) genes. Exposure to ceftriaxone induced a transition into a viable L-form state that was hyper-adhesive to macrophages in vitro. However, this survival adaptation was linked to a profound loss of pathogenicity. Using murine and guinea pig models, the L-form variant was shown to be completely attenuated, failing to cause the keratoconjunctivitis, diarrheal disease, or significant histopathology characteristic of the wild-type strain. These findings reveal a critical virulence-survival trade-off, positioning the L-form as a \"stealth\" phenotype that enables bacterial persistence at the expense of acute virulence.

Beta diversity analysis revealed strong clustering by depth, and not by station, even when including previously determined samples from other ocean basins.

Previous electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of PSII assembly/disassembly intermediates have relied on the analysis of deletion mutants or removal of PSII subunits in vitro. Here we have determined the cryo-EM structures of naturally occurring dimeric PSII intermediates from the cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus vestitus at a resolution of 2.2 Angstrom. These intermediates contain inactive dimers lacking the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) and semi-active dimers with the OEC present in one of the two monomers. Our structural data provide a mechanism for how assembly and disassembly of the Mn4CaO5 cluster is coordinated with the binding and release of the extrinsic proteins: restructuring of the C-terminal tail of D1 subunit during assembly or disassembly of the Mn cluster triggers conformational changes in D2, CP47 and CP43 to drive the binding/release of the extrinsic proteins. A combination of structural and mass spectrometry data indicates that the inactive PSII complexes are disassembly complexes and that oxidation of D1-His332, a monodentate ligand to one of the Mn ions of the OEC, is an early event in the photoinactivation of PSII.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Thus, there is an urgent need for a computational model to predict new bacteriocins and aid in drug development. This work centers on constructing predictive models with XGBoost machine learning algorithm, using physicochemical structural properties and sequence profiles of protein sequences. We employed correlation analyses, cross-validation, and hypergraph-based techniques to select features. Cross-validation feature evaluation (CVFE) partitions the dataset, selects features within each partition, and identifies common features, ensuring representativeness. On the contrary, hypergraph-based feature evaluation (HFE) focuses on minimizing hypergraph cut conductance, leveraging higher-order data relationships to precisely utilize information regarding feature and sample correlations. The XGBoost models were built using the selected features obtained from these two feature evaluation methods. Our HFE-based approach achieved 99.11% accuracy and an AUC of 0.9974 on the test data, overall outperforming the CVFE-based feature evaluation method and yielding results comparable to existing approaches. We also analyzed the feature contributions directly from the best model using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).

To investigate their role in t(8;21) AML, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of pediatric patients and age-matched healthy controls, identifying significant downregulation of lncRNA HOTAIRM1, a regulator of myeloid differentiation (adjusted P < 0.05). This was confirmed in three datasets: single-cell RNA-sequencing (GSE116256), the Leukemia MILE study (GSE13159, P=0.03), and the current study (P<0.0001). Analysis of downstream pathways activated by HOTAIRM1 loss identified miR-222, an oncomiR, as a de-repressed target (P=0.01).

Despite advancements in treatment, current medications often fail to fully restore bone integrity and prevent fragility fractures in the osteoporotic individuals. Thus, there is a high demand of novel therapeutic modalities in dealing with osteoporosis. Interleukin-3 (IL-3), a cytokine secreted by activated T cells, emerges as a promising therapeutic candidate. The dual role of IL-3 in inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and promoting osteoblast differentiation, offers protection against bone and joint degeneration in arthritic mice. However, its role in osteoporosis is not yet delineated. Therefore, our investigation focuses on elucidating the role of IL-3 in PMO, employing both prophylactic and therapeutic strategies in ovariectomized mice, mimicking human PMO. In our study, at the onset of osteoporosis, IL-3 treatment effectively preserved trabecular bone architecture and enhanced bone mineral density in OVX mice, particularly notable in therapeutic interventions where fully developed osteoporosis was addressed. Notably, in preventive measures, IL-3 inhibited osteoclast differentiation, thereby suppressing bone resorption, while in therapeutic approaches, it enhanced osteoblast differentiation, promoting bone formation. Irrespective of gender specific, microCT analysis of IL-3-/- (KO) mice showed reduced trabecular bone development compared to its respective wild type (WT) mice, highlighting essential role of IL-3 in skeletal integrity. Moreover, IL-3 increased Treg cells population while inhibiting B cell lymphopoiesis in ovariectomized mice with no adverse effects on hematopoiesis or vital organs. In conclusion, our findings collectively underscore the potential of IL-3 as a novel therapy for PMO, offering insights into its mechanisms of action and clinical applications.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Aptamer-receptor recognition acts as a molecular gate for force transduction, enabling the design of mechanoprobes with dual selectivity; by force magnitude and cell type. These probes interpret diverse mechanical inputs via distinct mechanisms, including actomyosin-driven contractility relayed through focal adhesions and membrane ruffling during macropinocytosis. By integrating aptamer mechanoprobes with upstream DNA reaction networks, we achieve reversible and temporally programmable mechanoresponses.

To fill this gap, we developed a novel Probabilistic Approach Avoidance Task (PAAT) and characterized behavior in this task using sequential sampling models. In this task, participants (N=34, 24 females) made a series of choices between pairs of options, each consisting of variable probabilities of reaching a positive outcome (monetary reward) and of reaching a negative outcome (aversive image). Participants tended to choose options that maximized the likelihood of reward and minimized the likelihood of aversive outcomes. Moreover, the weights they placed on each of these differed for choices where these likelihoods were in opposition (i.e., the riskier option was also more rewarding; incongruent trials) relative to when these were aligned (congruent trials). Computational modeling revealed that the relative influence of rewarding and aversive outcomes on choice was captured by differences in the rate of decision-relevant information accumulation. These modeling results were validated with a series of model comparisons and posterior predictive checks, demonstrating that our sequential sampling models reliably captured our behavioral data.

To account for diverse forms of observed deviations, here we introduce duet predictive coding, a minimal and biologically plausible framework in which functional subgroups of neurons encode positive and negative prediction errors separately. In contrast to classical predictive coding, which assumes top-down input is purely inhibitory, our theory posits that it is context-dependent rather than absolute. This model reproduces neural responses observed in diverse predictive coding paradigms across visual and auditory cortices. Critically, our framework predicts the existence of neurons tuned to negative prediction errors in the oddball paradigm, a prediction confirmed by our analyses, yet overlooked by classical predictive coding models. Our findings suggest that the brain's deviance detection relies on duet predictive error computation, offering a unifying explanation across seemingly disparate experimental protocols.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Adoptive T cell therapy addresses this by activating and expanding highly effective T cells ex vivo before injecting them into the patient to employ their cancer-killing functions. Recent experimental setups significantly improve T cell expansion over conventional methods by using activating micro-rod scaffolds. There is still much to understand regarding the factors that maximise the expansion of functional T cells in these scaffolds. We present a stochastic agent-based model of T cell expansion alongside its continuum limit to simulate the average interactions between T cells and micro-rods. These models help to provide reasoning for phenomena observed in laboratory experiments. For example, stochastic simulations demonstrate that T cell expansion is driven by activated cell clusters around micro-rods. Using our spatial models and a mean-field approximation, we discover that this cluster-driven expansion is most supported by scaffolds with initially homogeneous micro-rod concentrations. Our simulations reveal that the loading of the T cell growth factor, interleukin-2, into micro-rods significantly prolongs expansion compared to the conventional method of supplementation.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

An attractive approach to identifying chemical hits as starting points for antimalarial drug discovery involves the repositioning and chemical optimization of compounds used in other disease areas that are active against the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Here we show that the human checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) inhibitor, CHIR-124 is active in vitro against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant asexual blood stage parasites and competitively binds to several Plasmodium kinases, including P. falciparum aurora-related kinase-1 (PfArk1). The compound also shows moderate activity against both the liver and gametocyte forms of the parasite. Further target investigation for CHIR-124 via conditional knockdown experiments confirmed that PfArk1 is implicated in its parasiticidal activity. Notably, CHIR-124 also inhibits {beta}-hematin (synthetic hemozoin) formation and causes a dose-dependent increase in free heme that correlates with inhibition of parasite growth. These findings suggest that polypharmacology is involved in the activity of CHIR-124 against P. falciparum via the dual inhibition of Plasmodium PfArk-1 and hemozoin formation, both essential for parasite proliferation. This is further supported by in vitro drug combination experiments, morphological studies and resistance generation attempts.

While several studies have shown that including GxE can improve prediction accuracy in agricultural species, no increase in accuracy has been observed in human studies. In this work, we sought to investigate the reasons for the contradictory results between agricultural species and humans. Model organisms are useful for studying GxE, since environments can be controlled and genotypes can be replicated across environments. Thus, we used data from a previous study in Drosophila melanogaster, where the authors measured lifespan in different environments and found evidence of GxE. We devised three different cross-validation (CV) scenarios that mimic the relationships between reference and test populations observed in agriculture and human studies, and fitted a few statistical models with and without including GxE. The results showed that GxE explained 8% of lifespan variance. Despite that, models accounting for GxE improved prediction accuracy only in CV scenarios where the same genotypes are observed in both the reference and test populations. While these scenarios are common in agriculture, where individuals of the same family or variety appear in both populations, they are not encountered in human studies, where individuals are unrelated.

SAME enables experimental designs that leverage each modality independently while computationally recovering cross-modal spatial structure, unlocking multimodal discoveries in complex tissues.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}
{"title": "High-Accuracy, Ultrafast DNA Barcode Identification via Statistical Sketching and Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.13.664560", "authors": "Boone, J.", "abstract": "High-throughput DNA barcoding, a cornerstone of modern biodiversity and environmental genomics, is critically limited by the computational cost of traditional, alignment-based identification methods. While faster alignment-free approaches have been proposed, first-generation techniques based on k-mer hashing are fundamentally unreliable due to their inherent sensitivity to insertions and deletions (indels), a common form of sequence variation. Here, we introduce DNA-Sketch, a novel alignment-free framework that overcomes this limitation. DNA-Sketch transforms a DNA sequence into a robust statistical fingerprint by vectorizing its binned dinucleotide frequencies. These high-dimensional \"sketches\" are then indexed for ultrafast similarity search using an Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) library. We benchmarked a single-pass sketch and a \"Multi-Sketch Ensemble\" against the state-ofthe- art aligner VSEARCH on a large, challenging benchmark simulating real-world noise and intra-species variation. The Multi-Sketch Ensemble achieved 100% accuracy, perfectly matching VSEARCH, while delivering a 31-fold speed improvement. The single-pass sketch achieved 99.98% accuracy with a 95-fold speedup. DNA-Sketch resolves the classic speedversus- accuracy trade-off, demonstrating that by pairing robust feature extraction with highperformance ANN indexing, it is possible to achieve the accuracy of gold-standard alignment at a fraction of the computational cost, providing a powerful and highly scalable solution for modern bioinformatics.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "The zonal collagen architecture of articular cartilage (AC) is essential for its mechanical function and long-term homeostasis. While its structural organization is well established, the mechanistic basis for the emergence and maintenance of this architecture remains unresolved. In this study, we propose a fluid flow - driven mechanism for the evolution of collagen fiber orientation in AC, using both a continuum orientation field model and a discrete three-dimensional fiber network model. Joint movements, shear-dominated during embryogenesis and combined shear-compression postnatally, induce synovial fluid flow, which guides collagen alignment through preferential fiber deposition. Our models reproduce the characteristic Benninghoff architecture observed in mature AC and are validated against experimental data across multiple species, joint types, and developmental stages. We demonstrate how joint- and organism-specific mechanical loading leads to diverse collagen arrangements and zonal organization. Further, by systematically varying shear and compressive loading durations to mimic different physical activities, we show that the collagen architecture, mechanical stiffness, and effective synovial fluid viscosity of AC adapt in an activity-dependent manner. Finally, we simulate osteoarthritic remodeling as a localized disruption to fluid flow and show how it leads to progressive collagen disorganization. These findings offer a unifying biomechanical framework for AC development, function, and degeneration, with implications for tissue engineering and rehabilitation strategies.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

Recent studies suggest that radiation-induced astrocyte reactivity fosters a tumor-supportive environment, however effective strategies targeting reactive astrocyte phenotypes are lacking. Using a novel image-based assay, we screened over 1,700 small molecule compounds, identifying 29 that inhibit radiation-induced astrocyte reactivity in human astrocytes. Among these, Flunarizine, a calcium-entry blocker approved for migraine treatment, significantly reduced astrocyte reactivity in vitro and in vivo. In a genetically engineered glioblastoma mouse model, combining Flunarizine with radiotherapy markedly improved survival without affecting unirradiated controls, indicating specificity for a radiation-induced phenotype. Mechanistically, Flunarizine inhibited radiation-induced fibrosis in vivo and directly suppressed astrocytic TGF-beta activation in vitro. Notably, Flunarizine treatment had no direct effect on primary glioblastoma cells, emphasizing its microenvironmental specificity. In conclusion, we identified Flunarizine as a promising repurposed compound capable of effectively mitigating radiation-induced astrocyte reactivity and delaying glioblastoma recurrence.

Saccharimonadia abundance in human saliva with inflammatory conditions such as periodontitis and inflammatory bowel disease, while recent in vivo evidence suggests potential anti-inflammatory properties. Investigating Ca. Saccharimonadia is challenging due to their fastidious nature, making standard culturing methods impractical. Current genomic studies rely on either co-cultivation with bacterial hosts or shotgun metagenomics, both requiring advanced technical expertise and costly resources. To address this limitation, we developed an affordable and efficient protocol for enriching Ca. Saccharimonadia from human saliva samples, facilitating genome sequencing. Our protocol, termed the Ca.

Antimicrobial-producing bacteria have been explored as probiotics or biocontrol agents, but their mechanisms of action and impact on host-associated microbiota remain poorly understood. Here, we identified Pseudomonas mosselii KH-ZF1, a bacterium isolated from fish epidermal mucus, as a producer of antimicrobial substances. When applied to zebrafish, KH-ZF1 transiently adhered to the epidermal mucus and altered the composition of the skin microbiota. Under an appropriate administration condition, KH-ZF1 treatment significantly improved survival in zebrafish infected with Yersinia ruckeri, and suppressed pathogen growth on the skin surface. However, in the absence of KH-ZF1 or inappropriate conditions, Y. ruckeri dominated the epidermal bacterial community. The antimicrobial compound produced by KH-ZF1 was identified as Fluviol C (FluC), a pigmented metabolite previously reported from Pseudomonas fluorescens. FluC inhibited the growth of multiple fish pathogens at low concentrations, but exhibited toxicity to zebrafish even below its minimum inhibitory concentration. Intriguingly, FluC at sub-inhibitory levels induced bacterial substitution in the epidermal microbiota, mimicking the effects of KH-ZF1. These findings demonstrate that KH-ZF1 alters host resistance to infection by promoting bacterial substitution on the fish skin by producing FluC. Our study highlights a microbiota-mediated mechanism by which antimicrobial-producing bacteria can control infection through fish epidermis, offering a potential alternative to traditional antibiotics in aquaculture.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

As a part of effort on generating reference genomes for these populations, we present the first gapless, telomere-to-telomere (T2T) diploid genome assembly created by using a trio sample set of Indian ancestry (I002C), with NG50 of 154.89 Mb and 146.27 Mb for the maternal and paternal haplotypes, including the fully assembled rDNA array for the maternal chromosome 21 and Y chromosome. With the Merqury QVs of 82.05, 83.08 and 82.64 for the maternal, paternal and haploid assemblies respectively, I002C represents the highest-quality human genome assembled in both diploid and haploid forms to date. Compared to CHM13, the I002C genome displays substantial sequence diversity, resulting in 14,943 structural variants, including 3,236 novel variants absent from public databases. Analysis of trio-phased haplotypes further revealed elevated inter-haplotype divergence within centromeric and subtelomeric regions, along with identification of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) as candidates for novel imprinting loci. As a result of substantial SVs between them, I002C is a more suitable reference than CHM13 for the genomic analysis of South Asian samples with less reference bias and better performance in mapping and variant calling, particularly for long read sequencing data.

We used this new resource of conserved plant chromatin states to understand the influence of chromatin states on gene regulation. We established the preferential association of chromatin states with binding sites and activity of transcription factors. These associations define three main groups of transcription factors that bind upstream of the transcription start site, at the +1 nucleosome or further downstream of the transcription start site and broadly associate with distinct biological functions.

C.; Patra, N.; Hazra, S.", "abstract": "Cephalosporins remain one of the largest classes of antibiotics used clinically, with a diverse group of dual substituents at C3 and C7 positions. The fragmentation of the C-3 side chain from the C3' position after hydrolysis by Serine or metallo-beta-lactamase, leaving an exo-methylene group, has been introduced in the literature recently, but the exact mechanism by which it happens remains unclear until now. Our incrystallo findings suggest that the fragmentation of the C3 side chain will depend on the C3' atom and its hybridization state. A C3' carbon with sp2 hybridization will not allow fragmentation, but a sp3 hybridized carbon will facilitate the detachment of the side chain. Furthermore, heteroatoms like Sulfur, on C3' position, bearing vacant d-orbitals participate in pi cloud delocalization, making the detachment of C3 side chain energetically unfeasible. For the sp3 hybridized carbon at C3', the fragmentation of the bond was independent of the C3'' atom. We observed fragmentation of the C3'-C3'' bond for all three heteroatoms, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and sulfur, at the C3'' position. We validated our crystallographic findings with mass spectrometry to confirm the fragmentation of the C3 side chain in sp3 carbon and the unfragmented side chain in sp2 carbon and sulfur at C3' position. QM/MM simulations on three types of enzyme-cephalosporin complexes with different C3 side chains confirm the mechanism of fragmentation. Beyond revealing C3 side chain fragmentation in cephalosporins, useful for inhibitor and diagnostic design, our QM/MM methods are useful on incrystallo complexes to show the en-zyme catalysis.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}

A total of fifteen male Holtzman albino rats were randomly assigned to one Control group (n = 5, no risperidone) and two treatment groups (n = 5 per group) at doses of 0.4 mg kg-1 day-1 and 4.0 mg kg-1 day-1 of risperidone, administered via orogastric gavage for 20 consecutive days. Following the treatment, brain and liver tissues were collected. Superoxide Dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT), Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PDH), and Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) enzymes were analyzed. Reduced Glutathione (GSH) levels and lipid peroxidation quantified as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), were quantified. The findings indicate that both risperidone doses significantly increased CAT activity in brain tissue. The higher dose (4.0 mg kg-1 day-1) significantly reduced TBARS levels in the brain. In liver tissue, a significant increase in G6PDH activity was observed at the 4.0 mg kg-1 day-1 dose.

Although previous research has established associations between early adversity and altered attention and cognitive-affective processing, the specific mechanisms of information-processing through which adolescent PV may affect later social functioning remain unclear. METHODS: We conducted a counterfactual multimethod study in a sample of young adults (age 22; n = 191; 47.1% female), comparing individuals with and without a history of PV between ages 11-20. Specifically we employed: (1) an eye tracking task using a free-viewing paradigm to assess spontaneous threat-related attention; (2) a longitudinal analysis of changes in hostile attribution and reactive aggression using baseline data collected prior to PV exposure and follow-up data in young adulthood; and (3) a morph-based task assessing facial emotion discrimination capabilities between happy and angry expressions. RESULTS: Relative to controls, victims exhibited a vigilance-avoidance attentional pattern and blunted affective responses; they showed reduced initial gaze allocation, repeated returns to angry faces, and a tendency to rate more angry faces as neutral. Over adolescence, a flatter decline in hostile attribution and a steeper drop in reactive aggression led to elevated hostile attribution and reduced reactive aggression. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a victim profile characterized by impaired attentional processing with biased social threat perception, a more hostile view of the social world, and blunted affect. Our study offers preliminary evidence that adolescent PV may induce enduring changes in social information processing, with implications for maladaptive social cognition and increased risk for psychopathology.

NRK-52E and primary renal cells were treated with calcium oxalate-monohydrate (COM) to induce nephrocalcinosis like pathological changes. siRNAs and commercially available inhibitor was used to block RIPK2 activity. Oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, crystal adhesion, and changes in cell morphology were measured as endpoint markers. Exposure to COM but not to adenine, H2O2, and high-glucose significantly upregulated RIPK2 levels and induced oxidative stress, intracellular-calcium overload, and mitochondrial dysfunction. This was accompanied by the activation of NF-{kappa}B pathway, high levels of pro-inflammatory and low levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, increased apoptosis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). RIPK2 silencing or pharmacological inhibition effectively mitigated these pathological changes and restored levels of antioxidant enzymes. Mechanistically, RIPK2 inhibition disrupted the NF-kappaB/TGF-beta1 signaling and reduced CaOx crystal adhesion. Preliminary data from our previously conducted in vivo CaOx mouse model study confirmed the CaOx-induced RIPK2 upregulation.

In previous work, we used RNA immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry to show that more than 30 distinct RNA modifications, or chemical moieties, were present on the RNA genome of ZIKV. Among these, N4-acetylcytosine (ac4C) was one of the most abundant modifications. In this study, we investigated the role of N-acetyltransferase 10 (NAT10), the writer enzyme that acetylates cytidine, in ZIKV gene expression. Using NAT10 knockout cell lines, RNA interference (RNAi), and overexpression rescue strategies, we found that loss of NAT10 led to increased levels of ZIKV protein and RNA. However, the production of infectious virus particles was not significantly affected. Interestingly, in NAT10-deficient cells compared to wild-type (WT) cells, ZIKV protein and RNA were detectable earlier during infection, suggesting that the loss of NAT10 facilitated increased viral replication. Despite this increase, ZIKV RNA was more rapidly degraded, although the accumulation of small flaviviral RNAs was not significantly altered by the absence of NAT10. Further analysis of key components of the innate immune response revealed that, in the absence of NAT10 and during early infection, STAT1, IFIT1, and MX1 mRNA transcripts were rapidly degraded, leading to reduced expression of the respective innate immune proteins. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that NAT10, the ac4C writer enzyme, modulates the stability of specific innate immune mRNAs and thereby plays a regulatory role in ZIKV infection dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-17", "journal": ""}
