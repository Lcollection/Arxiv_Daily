N.", "abstract": "The X chromosome gene, DDX3X is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase with roles in transcription, splicing, nuclear export, and translation. Loss of function mutations in DDX3X are linked to a variety of neoplasms, including B-cell lymphoma. We find that conditional homozygous deletion (Mb1-Cre) of Ddx3x in developing mouse B cells in female mice results in a complete absence of mature peripheral B cells associated with an absolute block at the pro-B cell stage of development in the bone marrow. In male mice with Vav1-Cre or Mb1-Cre mediated hemizygous deletion of Ddx3x, there are less severe reductions in peripheral B-cell frequencies with skewing towards the marginal zone lineage, suggesting that the Y chromosome homolog Ddx3y or other male factors may partially compensate for loss of Ddx3x. Loss of Ddx3x in male mice is associated with perturbations at developmental time points linked to cell cycle arrest and immunoglobulin chain rearrangement. Mechanistically, loss of Ddx3x in pre-B cells is associated with reduced expression of the histone reader Brwd1, failure to curtail proliferation, and defective Igk rearrangement, which skews the peripheral B cell receptor repertoire toward lambda light chain usage. These data reveal that Ddx3x plays an essential role in B-cell development by supporting proliferative and epigenetic changes necessary for rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

We found that seasonal methylation of CpG sites upstream of the Plxnb3 is correlated with gut length plasticity, and deletion of this region abolishes plasticity. Additionally, standing variation in Ppp3r1 is associated with genetically fixed longer gut length in populations lacking plasticity.

Disruptions in this interaction are linked to various human diseases, yet the mechanisms enabling robust body-axis formation through {beta}-catenin/Wnt-Dkk interactions remain unclear. A key model system for Wnt-driven pattern formation is the pre-bilaterian organism Hydra, where two ancestral Dkk proteins interact with Wnt signalling to self-organise the body axis. While Hydra patterning has been extensively studied using the activator-inhibitor framework, a model integrating experimentally identified molecules has been lacking. Here, we introduce a mathematical model that incorporates both Dkks and their experimentally observed interactions with Wnt signalling. Numerical and analytical studies show that this network alone is sufficient to drive de novo body-axis formation across a broad parameter range. Our mutual inhibition model provides a biologically grounded realization of the general local-activation/long-range-inhibition (LALI) principle of de novo pattern formation, offering a mechanistic explanation for the observed Dkk and Wnt expression patterns under various conditions. Unlike previous models, it is directly grounded in experimental data, links injury response to pattern formation, and remains robust against perturbations.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Despite detailed structural knowledge on the arrestin interactions with phosphorylated tails of GPCRs, the interplay between receptor phosphorylation and arrestin coupling to the CME machinery is not well understood, in particular due to the weakness and dynamics of the individual molecular interactions. Here we have characterized the interactions of arrestin2, which is activated by the phosphorylated C-terminus of the human chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), with the main protein constituents of CME, namely clathrin and AP2 by solution NMR spectroscopy, biochemical and cellular assays. The NMR analysis revealed that arrestin2 interacts weakly with clathrin through a single binding site, independent of arrestin2 activation. In contrast, the arrestin2-AP2 interaction is stronger, requires arrestin2 activation by the CCR5 phospho-tail, and depends quantitatively on its degree of phosphorylation. These in vitro results are corroborated by cellular assays, which show that the chemokine-induced formation of a long-lived CCR5- arrestin2 internalization complex depends strongly on the interaction of arrestin2 with AP2, but not with clathrin. Taken together, these findings provide quantitative, atom-scale insights on the first steps of CCR5 endocytosis.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

For example, the nutrient content of food is first estimated in the mouth, in the form of flavor, and then measured again via slower signals from the gut. How these signals from the mouth and gut are integrated to drive learning is unknown. Here we identify a lateralized dopamine pathway that is specialized for learning about the nutrient content of food. We show that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA-DA) are necessary for associating nutrients with flavors, and that post-ingestive nutrients trigger DA release selectively in a small region of the anterior basolateral amygdala (BLA) but not canonical DA targets in striatum. Remarkably, this nutrient-triggered DA release occurs preferentially on the left side of the brain in both mice and humans, revealing that the DA system is functionally lateralized. We identify the gut sensors that are responsible for nutrient-triggered DA release; show that they activate BLA-projecting DA neurons defined by expression of cholecystokinin (CCK); and demonstrate that stimulation of DA axon terminals in the anterior BLA drives flavor-nutrient learning but not other aspects of feeding behavior. Two-photon imaging of neurons in the left anterior BLA reveals that they integrate gustatory and post-ingestive cues, and silencing these neurons prevents flavor-nutrient learning. These findings establish a neural basis for how animals learn about the nutrient content of their food.

S.; Movsumova, E.; Reznik, J.; Santiago, Z.; Asante-Asamani, E.; Brazill, D.", "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells, such as cancer and immune cells, migrate using either pressure-driven blebs or actin polymerization driven pseudopods, with cells preferring to bleb in confined environments where high protrusion forces are required for movement. Blebbing involves a separation of the cell membrane from the cortex, via the detachment of membrane-to-cortex linker proteins. The detached membrane then expands and stabilizes into a spherical cap as a new cortex is formed beneath the protruded membrane while the old one is completely degraded. The role of linker proteins in blebbing has mostly been associated with directing blebs to the leading edge of the cell, where linker enrichment is low, suggesting that cells devoid of linker proteins will bleb profusely. However, experimental work in this study involving talA null chemotaxing Dictyostelium discoideum cells shows the opposite effect, pointing to an alternative role for TalA. Our quantitative analysis of bleb size and frequency reveals that talA null cells produce fewer and smaller blebs in confined environments, pointing to a reduction in their intracellular pressure. A mathematical model of bleb expansion developed and validated with our experimental data supports the hypothesis that linker proteins help the cell maintain intracellular pressure during blebbing by limiting changes to its surface area when pressurized. Our model also identifies elastic and viscous properties of the cell, the assembly rate of the new cortex and disassembly rate of the old cortex as key modulators of change in bleb size induced by weakening the strength of membrane to cortex attachment.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThis work analyzes the role of the membrane-to-cortex linker protein talA in regulating bleb size and frequency during bleb-based chemotaxis. We identified that this protein helps to regulate intracellular pressure by preventing pressure loss due to uniform membrane expansion around the cell. In particular, cells form smaller and less frequent blebs without TalA. Analysis of a mathematical model for bleb expansion demonstrates that weakening the strength of linker proteins is sufficient to reduce the size of blebs. Our model also identifies an important role for actin dynamics and the viscoelastic properties of the cell in regulating the percentage change in blebs due to weakening membrane to cortex attachment. Additionally, we find that cells can partially retract blebs without myosin II by regulating the ratio of polymerization and depolymerization of actin in the reforming cortex.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Objectives This study aims to determine analytically the range of crop clustering that minimizes the initial rate of pathogen invasion. Methods We studied artificial agricultural landscapes with crop areas arranged in identical square clusters on a regular square lattice.

In addition to ensuring pollination, flower-visiting insects are also crucial for numerous other biotic interactions, using floral resources as fuel in their search for prey, hosts, breeding sites, and other resources. Insect-flower interactions may thus be a strategic target for actions to conserve and restore biotic interactions in ecosystems heavily degraded by intensive land use and climate change, such as the arid savannas of the northern Sahel. Very little is known about insect-flower interactions in this region. We aimed to document for the first time the diversity of flower-visiting insects in the northern Sahel and to examine whether restoration efforts of the Great Green Wall initiative have affected insect abundance and diversity. Using two capture methods, hand netting and pan traps, we inventoried insects visiting flowers of Balanites aegyptiaca. This species, the region's most abundant tree, is also economically important. We sampled three sites in a single locality: a 'Restored' site from which livestock are excluded, an 'Unrestored' site in intensively grazed rangeland, and a topographical 'Depression' site in a grazed area but with high tree density. Each site was sampled at three different periods to examine variation in this extremely harsh and seasonal environment. The open-access flowers of B. aegyptiaca are produced in multiple flowering events each year. We found a surprisingly high diversity of insects visiting its flowers, comprising 371 morphospecies from 10 insect orders, with a predominance of Hymenoptera and Diptera. Insect abundance, diversity and species composition differed markedly between seasons. Bees appear to be important pollinators, particularly solitary bees of the family Halictidae, which were abundant in all seasons. Diptera, in particular several families of small flies, were also frequent visitors and were especially abundant and diverse in the wet season. Ants were abundant, ocurring at flowers mainly in the dry season, when few resources other than flowers and flower-visiting insects were likely available to them. Insect abundance and observed diversity differed only little between sites, but estimated total diversity (Chao1 richness) was highest in the Depression site. Insects visiting flowers of B. aegyptiaca included herbivores, decomposers, and parasitoids and predators of diverse arthropods, underlining the role of these floral resources in numerous facets of ecosystem functioning. The floral resources of B. aegyptiaca and other trees, which can flower throughout the year, are likely critical to assure the persistence of numerous insect species.

Some transcription factors (TFs) that control pigment production and cuticle elaboration in petal epidermal cells have been identified. However, little is known about the upstream developmental processes that pre-pattern the petal surface to first establish the different domains where these regulators will later be expressed. Here, we developed a computational model of the evolution and development of petal patterns to investigate this early pre-patterning phase. We selected for gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that could divide the petal surface into two regions to create a bullseye, a very common type of petal pattern across the angiosperms. The evolved GRNs showed robust patterning dynamics and could generate a variety of bullseye proportions. We found that the evolution of bullseye patterns was often accompanied by the spontaneous emergence of a third cell type with a unique gene expression profile at the boundary between the proximal and distal regions. These bullseye boundary cells appeared in most simulations despite not being explicitly selected for, and we validated their presence experimentally in Hibiscus trionum, a model system whose flowers display a bullseye pattern. Although boundary cell types emerged spontaneously in our simulations, they evolved more often and were more important for pattern formation when gene expression was modelled as a noisy process. This suggests that GRNs producing this emergent cell type may support reproducible bullseye formation by buffering against developmental variability. Altogether, the results from our evolutionary simulations illuminate the early steps of petal pattern formation and demonstrate that novel cell types can arise spontaneously and repeatedly from selection on other cell types when developmental robustness is considered.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Triad-LMF harmonizes heterogeneous omics data and integrates information through a two-stage hierarchical fusion strategy. Local Pairwise Fusion and Global Triadic Fusion are combined via the Two-Feature and Three-Way LMF modules, enabling a gradual transition from local modality interactions to global feature integration. Experimental results show that Triad-LMF consistently outperforms existing methods.

Drosophila melanogaster Misato-Like protein (DML1) plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial function, yet its function in filamentous fungi remains unexplored. In this study, we characterized FgDML1 in F. graminearum. FgDML1 interacts with the mitochondrial fission and fusion protein FgDnm1 to maintain mitochondrial stability, thereby positively regulating acetyl-CoA levels and ATP synthesis, which influences toxisome formation and ultimately affects DON toxin biosynthesis. Additionally, FgDML1 is involved in the regulation of toxin biosynthetic enzyme expression. In the {Delta}FgDML1 mutant, Complex III enzyme activity decreased, overexpression of complex III assembly factors FgQCR2, FgQCR8, and FgQCR9 may induce conformational changes in the Qi-site protein, specifically altering the sensitivity of F. graminearum to respiratory inhibitor cyazofamid not Qo-site inhibitor pyraclostrobin and other fungicides. Furthermore, the loss of FgDML1 leads to defects in nutrient utilization, as well as in asexual and sexual reproduction, and pathogenicity. In conclusion, this study identifies a novel regulatory role for FgDML1 in DON toxin biosynthesis and cyazofamid sensitivity in F. graminearum. Our study provides a theoretical framework for understanding DON biosynthesis regulation in F. graminearum and identifies potential molecular targets for FHB control.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

A.; Van Lankveld, H.; Zhong, X. Z.; Chen, J. X.; Niculescu, S.; Zomorrodi, R.; Chen, J. J.", "abstract": "Introduction: Transcranial photobiomodulation (tPBM) relies on the photochemical stimulation of mitochondrial processes and has already demonstrated some ability to improve human cognition. However, it remains unclear how tPBM modulates neural oscillatory activity in real-time and how stimulation parameters and individual characteristics affect these responses. Capturing these dynamics is essential to understanding how the photochemical effects of tPBM translate into effective neuromodulation, especially in diverse populations. Methods: Our study provides the first evidence of a cumulative increase in the power of neuro-electric oscillations in healthy humans in 46 healthy young adults with diverse skin tones underwent 4 minutes of pulsed tPBM using varying laser parameters, including two wavelengths (808/1064 nm), two pulsation frequencies (10/40 Hz), and three irradiances (100/150/200 mW/cm2). To capture online and offline effects, we analyzed minute-by-minute baseline-normalized frequency band power and used mixed-effects modeling to uncover significant predictors of these responses among laser parameters, skin tone, and sex. Results: tPBM elicited frequency-band specific modulations in EEG power beginning near the stimulation site and propagating posteriorly over several minutes. Increases were cumulative with time, consistent with past fNIRS findings. They were also strongest and most sustained in beta/gamma bands, consistent with past findings of cognitive improvement. Significant parameter effects included stronger high-frequency responses at 808 nm and at 150 mW/cm2, wavelength-dependent frequency effects, larger responses in lighter skin, and parameter-specific sex differences. Conclusion: Both laser parameters and biological factors interact to shape the spatial and temporal neuromodulation profile of tPBM and hence, parameter selection is crucial for achieving specific outcomes. Our findings uncover the manner in which tPBM induces neuronal changes, and contribute to a framework for creating more informed and personalized tPBM protocols.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Transcriptomic aging clocks (TACs) can track biological age but remain limited by platform dependence, tissue specificity, or restricted accessibility.

Pasta accurately predicted relative age across diverse tissues, data types, including bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq as well as microarray data, and species. Its predictions aligned with senescent and stem-like cellular states, with model coefficients enriched for p53 and DNA damage response pathways. Pasta's age scores correlated with tumor grade and patient survival in several cancer types, indicating potential clinical relevance. Applied to the Connectivity Map L1000 dataset, Pasta identified both established and previously unrecognized age-modulatory compounds and genetic perturbations, highlighting mitochondrial translation and mRNA splicing as key determinants of cellular propensity for aging and rejuvenation, respectively. Experimental validation confirmed pralatrexate as a potent senescence inducer and piperlongumine as a rejuvenating agent.

Several theories - such as the exploration-exploitation hypothesis - propose that variability plays a key role in motor performance and learning. However, empirical measures of motor and proprioceptive precision are often limited by small sample sizes, and proprioceptive estimates, especially those relying on efferent signals, are difficult to isolate and quantify. In this study, we leveraged a large dataset of 270 participants - including a subsample of older adults (ages 54-84) - to assess the precision of hand movements and proprioceptive estimates, and to examine whether these factors predict individual differences in motor learning and adaptation. We found that baseline reach variance did not predict learning or changes in hand localization. Although active hand localization (which includes efferent contributions) was slightly more precise - showing an 8.6% reduction in variance - this suggests that unseen hand estimates rely primarily on proprioception. Neither motor nor sensory precision varied with age. However, reach aftereffects were modestly associated with proprioceptive precision before training and proprioceptive recalibration after training. No other measure of learning or variance was reliably associated. These findings suggest that reach aftereffects may partly reflect changes in hand proprioception, but overall, we identified no predictors of adaptation to a rotated visual cursor.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

This study investigated whether such modality-specific effects may emerge during movement preparation and how they unfold during movement execution. Participants performed reaching movements toward auditory, proprioceptive, or audio-proprioceptive targets. Electromyography and movement kinematics were recorded to examine the effect of target-related sensory modality on sensory encoding and coordination of motor commands during movement preparation, as well as their effect on movement execution. Results revealed a modality-dependent sensory encoding phase, whereas a modality-independent coordination of motor commands. While the target modality did not affect movement initiation, it modulated the subsequent movement execution. These findings demonstrate that, in non-visual target reaching, the effect of target-related sensory modality extends beyond execution to specific phases of movement preparation. Our results support a four-stage model of action control toward non-visual targets, consisting of a modality-dependent sensory encoding phase of movement preparation and early execution, as well as a modality-independent motor coordination and movement initiation.

Here, we used occupancy models to estimate what proportion of spatial units (both non-natural and forest) a given species occupied annually in the plantation. We tested models with different covariates for species for which most data were available: 13 birds, 3 reptiles and 7 mammals, among which the iconic Orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus). For each species, the model which best fitted the data was selected. Two shortcomings in our data complicated the analyses. First, occupancy models require detection and non-detection records, but because no fixed species lists were used, there is no unique way to generate non-detections. We generated non-detection records in several ways and ran the models again to evaluate the consequences for occupancy estimates. Second, imbalances in sampling may occur because of a lack of sampling design to select study sites. Most concerning are sites surveyed only once in 2020-2024. We ran the models without those sites to examine whether results were different.

While species-level pollinator interactions are important for predicting community stability, it remains equally crucial to understand individual-level interactions of keystone species in the community. This study examined the role of habitat factors and floral traits in shaping pollinator interactions at the individual plant scale of Maytenus senegalensis, a dominant native species in the semi-arid Aravalli Hills. We measured flower production, nectar sugar concentration, flower diameter, and external factors such as percentage soil moisture, distance to habitat edge, and density of co-flowering conspecifics to assess their impact on pollinator interactions and reproductive success. Results: We found significant variation in reproductive investment in the form of flower production and a trade-off with reward quality, where plants with higher flower production were found to have a lower nectar sugar concentration. Higher flower production negatively influenced reproductive success, suggesting the likelihood of increased within-plant visitation. Eristalinus and Apis were the dominant pollinator genera, and overall, Dipterans were found to play a critical role in maintaining the network stability. The presence of flowering conspecific plants in the neighborhood reduced the pollen deposition, suggesting competitive interactions. Moreover, individual plants were found to show some amount of specialization in their interaction niches. We predict that this could lead to further divergence of interaction niches due to pollinator-mediated competition. Any perturbation to interactions of plants with a high degree of pollinator connectance was found to disproportionately influence the network. Conclusions: Overall, our results link microhabitat (soil moisture) and neighborhood context to individual interaction niches, demonstrating that allocation trade-offs and conspecific competition jointly shape pollination and fitness. In semi-arid systems, which are undergoing considerable anthropogenic and climatic changes, our study provides insights into individual pollinator interaction niches and the role of microhabitat factors in species persistence within a community.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

In northern Australian tropical savannas, land clearing is much less but increasing. Aims To examine the relative change in bird community composition of a Queensland tropical savanna over a 12-year period where sites represent a gradient of habitat modification. I investigate if these changes trigger avifauna disruption in the wider intact woodlands. Methods The data were collected from 60 sites sampled seven times between 2004 and 2016, using an eight-count repeat census in each site, in each year of survey. The data was examined via a range of non-parametric multivariate method. Key Results The analysis of bird community composition indicated that variation was not parallel across the habitat modification gradient (i.e., cleared, thinned sites displayed higher temporal change and instability). The strongest directional change and temporal turnover in {beta}-diversity was strongly linked to the gradient of modification from cleared to thinned, to intact. Conclusions In this study I demonstrated that, where tree clearing has commenced or trees are thinned (even though it is only a small percentage of the total land cover), this initiates bird community instability, though the surrounding intact vegetation seemed to remain unaffected up until 2016. Implications Regional changes in bird populations can take many decades to appear after substantial disturbance, and continued monitoring of landscapes being progressively cleared, should be a priority to identify and prevent irreversible collapse of the avifauna, such has occurred in south-eastern Australia.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

While it has been central to their study for decades, no complete picture has emerged yet. Some of the most fascinating questions arise in the context of self-organised societies, like those of social insects, that coordinate their behaviour with completely decentralised simple decision-making performed by individuals that only have local information at their disposal. Based on empirical evidence, these collectives appear to balance task engagement globally across their whole task network for the benefit of the colony overall. How can this pro-social coordination be achieved by independently acting individuals? How is a global workforce balancing possible based on only local perception with no knowledge of the global colony status or needs? Central to solving these problems is the question how can the relevant information flow through the task network so that a changed task demand in one part of the colony can lead to adjustments in distant other parts? We detail a model that presents a potential answer to this conundrum. Our model is informed by evolutionary game theory and rests on the assumption that the perception of an individual's sensory input can evolve. We present simulation studies and a mathematical proof to show that pro-social behaviour will evolve in a collective of agents that adjust their behaviour using primitive and biologically plausible learning mechanisms if we assume an evolving perception function.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

In this work, we directly tested this model using live-cell super-resolution microscopy and Hi-C analysis.

Understanding how lipid storage and mobilization are regulated--and disrupted--in adipocytes is key to addressing obesity-associated complications. The ER-anchored protein Seipin controls lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis and maintenance, and its loss disrupts ER-LD contact sites. In humans, Seipin deficiency causes generalized lipodystrophy, a severe form of adipocyte dysfunction. We previously showed that Seipin also localizes at ER-mitochondria contact sites (MAM), where it regulates calcium exchange and mitochondrial function. Here, we examined whether Seipin targeting to MAM and ER-LD sites overlaps functionally. We analyzed subcutaneous adipose tissue (AT) from inducible Seipin-knockout mice using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and proximity ligation assays (PLA) to quantify membrane contact sites (MCS) involving the ER, LDs, and mitochondria. In control mice, feeding reduced MAMs while increasing ER-LD and mitochondria-LD contacts, whereas Seipin deficiency abolished this remodeling. Specifically, under lipid loading, MAMs located in proximity to LDs--tripartite contact sites known as MAM-LD--were increased in control but not in Seipin-deficient adipocytes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assays revealed that Seipin depletion impairs triglyceride transfer to LDs, an effect rescued by the MAM-LD-reinforcing synthetic peptide Linker-ER-Mi. Importantly, this rescue was abolished by silencing the mitochondrial calcium uniporter, demonstrating that calcium exchange is critical for triglyceride storage in LDs. We further investigated how MAM-LD remodeling influences adipocyte metabolic flexibility. Using TEM and PLA, we monitored two MAM subtypes: those forming MAM-LD and those engaging cytosolic mitochondria (MAM-CM). During adipogenesis, MAM-LD frequency increased while MAM-CM decreased. Similarly, in mouse AT and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, lipid loading selectively promoted MAM-LD. Notably, this adaptive remodeling of membrane contact sites was blunted in the adipose tissue of diet-induced obese mice. Genetic disruption of MCS in 3T3-L1 adipocytes altered lipid flux, impaired lipolysis, and reduced insulin signaling. Together, our findings identify MAM-LD contacts as key regulators of adipocyte lipid handling and metabolic flexibility, whose disruption may underlie the metabolic inflexibility of obesity.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

In other domains of the parameter space spanned by Esyn and gsyn, corresponding to diminished excitation/inhibition, the classifier fails (0.5 < score < 1), indicating the challenge in identifying the nature of the synapse inferred exclusively from postsynaptic spikes. For this task, gradient boosting gives higher classification accuracies that improve with further training, compared to other classifiers explored in this study.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that deletion of the measles virus C protein, a key viral antagonist of innate immunity, reprograms the live-attenuated vaccine strain into a RIG-I-driven cancer immunotherapy. The resulting virus, MVdeltaC, accumulates defective viral genomes that activate RIG-I/MAVS signaling and trigger robust type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. MVdeltaC kills tumor cells more rapidly and efficiently than the parental virus and induces hallmarks of immunogenic cell death, including HMGB1 release and dendritic cell maturation. Intratumoral administration in immunocompetent mice bearing syngeneic neuroblastoma induced complete tumor regression in 90% of animals and established long-term antitumor memory. Antitumor responses were dependent on CD8 T and NK cells and were further enhanced by anti-CTLA-4 therapy or CD4 T-cell depletion. Prior measles immunization accelerated tumor clearance, indicating vaccine-boosted responses. MVdeltaC also controlled the growth of human mesothelioma, melanoma, and triple-negative breast cancer xenografts and patient-derived tumors in immunodeficient models. These findings establish MVdeltaC as a clinically ready, broad-spectrum immunotherapeutic that links RIG-I activation through defective viral genome generation to elicit potent and durable antitumor immunity.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Previous studies discovered that PFL3 neurons compute a heading-goal error and directly project to the descending neurons that generate the steering commands.

Using the Drosophila connectome and circuit modeling, we uncover a layered control architecture in the lateral accessory lobes (LAL) that arbitrates between goal pursuit and stimulus-driving overrides. First, a dorsal pathway that forms a dominant indirect \"pro-goal\" push-pull circuit that amplifies left-right asymmetries. Second, a faster ventral pathway forms an \"anti-goal\" circuit that recruits and inverts the pro-goal circuit to redirect movement, and only engages when a goal is present. The architecture also resolves two symmetry challenges: Rear Stalemate (goal 180 behind) and Front Stalemate (threat dead ahead), by rapidly amplifying tiny perturbations into decisive turns.

To address these issues, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate how methodological factors influence A{beta}-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. We included 359 eligible studies encompassing 1,192 MTT-based comparisons of cell viability between A{beta}-treated and control SH-SY5Y cells.

Drawing on a wealth of empirical data, we integrate prey capture, engulfment, and internal and external digestion into a mathematical evolutionary model that quantifies the fitness of a primitive phagocytoser relative to a non-phagocytosing ancestor. We reveal the conditions under which a non-phagocytosing predator that digests its prey externally can persist. We also show that the phagocytoser can outperform the ancestor in a broad range of situations, despite the cost associated with producing a phagocytic cup. Parameter variations delineate how fast engulfment needs to be for phagocytosis to be advantageous, providing clear benchmarks for interpreting the importance of results in genetic knockout studies and mechanical models.

In this context, Drosophila melanogaster serves as a valuable alternative model for evaluating the toxicity of numerous substances and studying diseases like cancer, Alzheimers, and alcoholism. This work investigates the in vivo effects of orally administered Cisplatin (50 g/ml) and titanium dioxide (NPTiO2; 50 g/ml), alone and in combination, in D. melanogaster. Using RNA-seq and bioinformatics studies, we analyzed gene modulation to assess the toxic effects in each administration group. We found that flies treated with either Cisplatin or NPTiO2 alone exhibited gene modulation related to drug and non-toxic substance processing. However, the group treated with Cisplatin and TiO2 nanoparticles showed decrease in expression levels, a small number of DEGs, and a disruption in cell division processes and DNA/RNA metabolism.

Progress has been limited, however, by the difficulty of modeling complex audiovisual feature spaces - most prior work has therefore relied on short, controlled stimuli, or on stimuli from one modality at a time, leaving cortical mechanisms that support real-world comprehension poorly characterized. Further, while recent advances in artificial intelligence now enable the extraction of high-dimensional, time-resolved features from naturalistic stimuli, how cortical regions dynamically process auditory and visual information as time unfolds remains largely unexplored. Using large-scale fMRI data collected while participants watched movies, we developed two complementary computational approaches relying on prediction performance to map the moment-by-moment dynamics of sensory processing across cortical regions: one tracks when one modality predicts a regions activity substantially better than the other, capturing temporal transitions in modality dominance, while the other identifies periods when both modalities predict the region well, indicating balanced representation of auditory and visual information. Together, these analyses reveal two complementary patterns of audiovisual organization across cortex: a pair of \"bows\" of modality switching - one posterior bow encircling category-selective visual cortex and another anterior bow spanning dorsolateral frontal areas, and an arrow-like axis of bimodally predicted regions extending from lateral occipital cortex into the temporal cortex. The coexistence of these systems points to a cortical architecture that flexibly reweights sensory inputs while maintaining balanced multimodal representations, supporting robust comprehension of complex natural events. More broadly, this work illustrates how naturalistic neuroimaging experiments informed by modern machine learning approaches can reveal new principles of dynamic audiovisual processing in the human brain.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Here we present CellHermes, a biological language model that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs) to integrate multimodal forms of omics data, such as transcriptomic profile and PPI network, through natural language for better omics understanding. By reformulating these datasets into question-answer pairs, CellHermes emulates multiple self-supervised learning paradigms within a single, universal, language-based framework with LORA fine-tuning on existing natural language-LLM, achieving comparable or even better performance compared to current single-cell foundation models. Within this framework, CellHermes functions as an encoder, a predictor and an explainer for supporting a range of downstream tasks. For encoder, CellHermes encodes biological entities with embeddings that enable accurate network discovery and cross-dataset generalization; For predictor, CellHermes unifies heterogeneous downstream tasks by translating them into natural language question-answers pairs, allowing a single model to perform multi-task prediction by instruction fine-tuning; For explainer, CellHermes explains molecular mechanisms by combining attention analysis with text-based reasoning, leveraging the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We evaluated the ability of CellHermes as an encoder on representing genes and cells using 5 gene-level downstream tasks and 5 diverse single-cell datasets across different tissues compared with other single cell foundation models. We also evaluated CellHermes as a predictor on BioUniBench, a new benchmark of 10 tasks across 7 databases for LLMs, including perturbation response, cell fitness estimation, gene-disease association, and cell type identification. All benchmarks suggest CellHermes can unify multiple biological tasks within one model without compromising performance. By applying CellHermes as an explainer for a melanoma patients dataset, it can uncover potential key genes on tumor-reactive T cells.

However, in environments like soil, where microbial populations are spatially fragmented, sparse, nutrient-limited, and subject to mass transport, the mechanisms that enable QS-dependent processes remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigate the regulation of a secreted redox-active metabolite, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), in Pseudomonas synxantha 2-79, a model rhizobacterium, under phosphorus (P) limitation, a persistent stress in many soils. Using a combination of microscopy and molecular genetic approaches, we show that P limitation sensitizes the QS activation threshold by an order of magnitude, enabling phenazine induction at relatively low population densities in comparison to P replete conditions. This induction is abolished in QS-deficient mutants and restored by the addition of exogenous acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL), demonstrating that quorum sensing remains essential but its threshold becomes environmentally tuned. Under P limitation, spatial confinement and pore saturation levels further shape the timing and location of induction, illustrating how physical structure and nutrient stress can modulate bacterial activities. Moreover, phosphorus stress confers both collaborative and competitive advantages, enabling P. synxantha to undergo low-cell density AHL cross-talk between related Pseudomonas spp. and to suppress other rhizobacteria. Lastly, on plant roots, PCA genes are more predominantly induced under P limitation. These findings illustrate how the nutrient status of an environment can modulate the onset of quorum sensing, enabling quorum-regulated behaviors to activate at lower thresholds.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Pre-Omicron strains broadly suppressed antiviral interferon-stimulated gene expression and reprogrammed metabolism by reducing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and {beta}-oxidation. Delta infection was associated with extensive transcriptional and metabolic remodelling, characterised by activation of stress- and growth-related kinases and selective retention of biosynthetic amino acids, consistent with a host response to stress and viral modulation of interferon-associated signalling.

Although prior studies have hinted at FRG1's involvement in RNA biogenesis, its core molecular functions have remained largely elusive. Our previous work identified FRG1 as a transcriptional regulator of genes in the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway; however, the underlying mechanisms were not fully delineated. In this study, using a range of cellular models with altered FRG1 expression, we demonstrate that reduced FRG1 levels enhance NMD activity. We reveal that FRG1 is a structural component of both the spliceosome and the exon junction complex (EJC), and that it directly modulates NMD by interacting with UPF1--regulating its ubiquitination and degradation. Furthermore, we show that DUX4 inversely regulates the NMD machinery through FRG1, establishing a critical molecular axis. Despite its structural association with the EJC and spliceosome, the absence of FRG1 does not compromise the integrity of these complexes. Polysome profiling showed that FRG1 co-sediments with eIF4A3, a core EJC component, across translating ribosomal fractions. This interaction was further supported by proximity ligation assays confirming the close spatial proximity of FRG1 and eIF4A3. Importantly, we validated the impact of FRG1 perturbation on NMD efficiency and UPF1 levels in vivo using a transgenic FRG1 knockout zebrafish model. Together, these findings establish a direct, DUX4-independent role for FRG1 in regulating the NMD pathway and uncover a previously unrecognized function for FRG1 in post-transcriptional gene regulation.

In mice, we targeted a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator to the mediodorsal-prefrontal (MdT-dmPFC) projection and used fiber photometry to record synaptic dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) activity. As learning sessions progressed, all mice demonstrated a decrease in reaction time (RT) performance on successful trials (p<0.001). In concomitant synaptic MdT-dmPFC circuit activity across sessions, we observed a significant increase in activity during the anticipatory (p<0.01) and reward retrieval (p<0.01) periods, and a non-significant trend towards an increase in preparatory activity (p<0.15). However, following the learning period, during task re-exposure, we observed a significant shift in circuit activity, away from anticipatory (p<0.001) and towards the preparatory period (p<0.001) over the course of re-exposure sessions. Furthermore, we observed an emergence of a learner (decrease in RT) and a non-learner group (increase in RT) during the task re-exposure period. Over the course of a single analogous task session in humans, we also observed a learner and a non-learner group. When analyzing the thalamoprefrontal regional connectivity dynamics of early and late trials for learners, we observed a significant increase in low frequency and decrease in high frequency synchrony (connectivity tilt) in thalamoprefrontal pathways during preparatory and anticipatory periods.

However, labs that typically use just D. melanogaster can have difficulties adopting other species into their experiments due to unique dietary needs and care regimens.

In contrast, the lateral (LFC) and medial (MFC) frontal cortices supported manipulation-and maintenance-based generalization, respectively. Critically, manipulation-based generalization in the PPC and LFC emerged even when participants did not explicitly learn the mapping between task spaces, indicating that active exploration of task structure can spontaneously facilitate generalization across tasks. Together, these findings reveal that flexible generalization for goal-directed behavior is achieved via a distributed WM network, with distinct regions serving active versus passive task demands.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Learning to reinforce rewarding actions and avoid repeated mistakes is crucial for survival in dynamic environments. Yet, it remains unclear how distinct neural signals coordinate to implement reward-based decision-making and behavioural adjustment. We obtained simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry during a probabilistic reversal learning task. Leveraging single-trial EEG, we first replicate the presence of two feedback-locked neural representations; an early signal previously linked to alertness and switching behaviours following negative feedback and a late signal associated with value updating and reward learning. Using single-trial pupillometry, we then show that differences in feedback-evoked pupil responses between positive and negative feedback are driven primarily by negative feedback encoding. Jointly examining these EEG and pupillometry signatures, we show that following negative feedback, increased trial-by-trial coupling between the pupil response and the early, but not the late, EEG signal is linked to increased uncertainty and exploration tendency as well as reduced accuracy and evidence accumulation on the next trial. Consistent with previous research implicating the locus-coeruleus-noradrenaline system in uncertainty signalling and network resets, we propose that when internal estimates of contextual uncertainty are high following negative feedback, an early signal, likely regulated by locus coeruleus activity, implements a network reset in reward learning structures of a later learning signal. This interruption may simultaneously increase the neural gain related to the processing of novel information and decrease the influence of existing representations in reward learning structures, in turn improving performance by creating new, more accurate internal representations of the external world.\n\nSignificance StatementThe current study jointly examines EEG and pupillometry signatures associated with reversal-learning during reward-based learning.

S.; Bascompte, J.", "abstract": "The Geographic Mosaic Theory of Coevolution (GMTC) predicts that reciprocal evolutionary effects vary across landscapes, generating hotspots and coldspots. Traditionally, these states are treated as discrete categories, even though the intensity of coevolutionary selection can vary continuously. To capture this variation, we introduce a concept of coevolutionary temperature, ranging from coldspot to hotspot. We propose two complementary metrics to quantify it: reciprocity and strength of pairwise evolutionary effects. We also extend the GMTC framework beyond its traditional focus on pairwise systems to species-rich communities. Applying this approach to empirical plant-pollinator networks in a fragmented landscape, we find pronounced geographic mosaics in coevolutionary temperature. Smaller habitat patches support small, highly connected, and weakly nested communities with high reciprocity and strength, suggesting that they act as coevolutionary hotspots. In contrast, larger patches host species-rich, poorly connected, and highly nested communities with low reciprocity and strength, consistent with coldspots. At the interaction scale, reciprocity depends on degree similarity, with interactions between species that have similar numbers of partners exhibiting higher reciprocity. Together, these results highlight the strong dependence of coevolutionary effects on spatial variation in community structure and show how extending the geographic mosaic framework to species-rich communities can deepen our understanding of coevolution in complex systems.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

We aimed to answer this question by using an evolutionary video game titled Project Hastur as a study system. In this video game, the enemies evolve traits to help them combat the players strategy. We determined whether the same environmental pressures (in this case, player strategy) lead to predictable evolution. We conducted a series of experiments with three different playing styles and four different evolutionary treatments with varying kinds of selection pressure, each with several replicates. For each replicate, enemies from the first and final generations were categorized into types using k-means clustering. The Euclidean distance between the cluster centroids and the sum of squares values were recorded for each replicate and compared among evolutionary treatments using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Evolutionary predictability was evaluated using permutation tests. We found that fitness functions in Project Hastur led to incredible, but unpredictable, diversity.

However, despite the improvements in the data quality, the GRN inference problem remains a challenging task with many approaches showing variable performance dependent on the organism and cell type. To improve the quality of GRN inference and enable more comprehensive exploratory analyses of GRNs across various phenotypes of interest, we developed a two-stage meta-method called GRNITE. In the first step, GRNITE leverages LLM-based embeddings of plain text gene descriptions to create a prior gene interaction graph, which is then optimized with a graph neural network (GNN) to achieve a \"universal\" biological prior for GRN inference. In the second step, GRNITE uses a GNN to incorporate information from a GRN inferred from scRNA-seq data with any baseline inference method into our prior. The result of this two-step approach is a near-universal improvement in AUROC and recall of all evaluated methods, with minor trade-offs in precision. Furthermore, GRNITE is a lightweight meta-method, which adds a minimal amount of extra compute time on top of the original GRN inference performed.

We use a spatially explicit, individual-based model to ask how dispersal evolution influences speciation and long-term diversity. Across archipelagos, rare long-distance dispersal events trigger colonization and divergence, after which dispersal traits evolve along two trajectories: increasing or decreasing range. These outcomes correlate with island size and isolation. Structured landscapes stabilize species richness through low turnover, whereas continuous landscapes remain species-poor despite high diversification rates.

Among these, neuron-derived neurotrophic factor-expressing (NDNF+) interneurons have been proposed to be \"master regulators\" of cortical microcircuits. While their role in coordinating physiological cortical activity is beginning to be understood, their contribution to restraining hyperexcitability during epileptiform activity remains unexplored. To address this, we employed calcium imaging, optogenetics, and chemogenetics in an NDNF-Cre mouse line to investigate how NDNF+ interneurons influence cortical hyperactivity and spontaneous seizures. Our results demonstrate that NDNF+ interneurons are actively recruited during interictal spikes and focal seizures, although more slowly than parvalbumin-positive interneurons. Optogenetic hyperpolarization of NDNF+ interneurons exacerbates epileptic discharges, whereas their depolarization suppresses focal seizures, even when the optogenetic stimulus is delayed by several seconds from seizure onset. This effect is largely mediated by GABAB receptor signalling. Additionally, chemogenetic depolarization of NDNF+ interneurons has robust antiepileptic effects both ex vivo and in vivo. Collectively, these findings establish NDNF+ neurons as key regulators of cortical excitability and identify them as promising cellular targets for the development of anti-epileptic therapies.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

By analyzing 3.9 million transcriptomes, we identified 19,371 unique expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) genes (eGenes) at a major cell type level, with the largest number of eQTLs observed in excitatory neurons. Notably, 31% of the eQTLs detected were highly cell-type-specific, with most restricted to excitatory neurons (69%). We compared the eQTLs with bulk RNA-seq datasets across different tissues and with a newly generated single nucleus dataset of 123 donors from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We observed that differences in eQTL effect sizes between brain cell types are often as large as comparing eQTLs between brain tissue and non-brain tissue from bulk RNA-seq studies. Furthermore, we observe that eQTL effect size agreement was highest for cell types with similar function, even when comparing brain to blood cells. This suggests that that bulk analyses substantially overestimate eQTL agreement, likely due to tissue-level averaging of cellular regulatory effects. Through colocalization, we prioritized 662 genes for 11 brain-related traits and prioritized a single cell type in 68% of genes. Our findings demonstrate that eQTL effects are far more cell-type-specific than previously recognized, underscoring the need to expand single-cell eQTL studies across diverse tissues and cell types to fully capture the regulatory architecture of genetic variants.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Highly selective D4R compounds may provide a valuable tool to elucidate D4R function and assess their potential as non-stimulant ADHD treatments.\n\nObjectivesThis study examined the behavioral effects of two novel D4R drugs, namely, FMJ-01-38 (high-efficacy partial agonist) and FMJ-01-54 (full antagonist) in adolescent spontaneously hypertensive (SHR/NCrl) rats, a validated ADHD model, and Wistar controls.\n\nMethodsRats received intraperitoneal FMJ-01-38 or FMJ-01-54 (5-10 mg/kg) or vehicle prior to behavioral assays assessing locomotor activity (open field tests), recognition memory (novel object preference), attention and working memory (Y-maze test), and impulsivity (delay discounting task).\n\nResultsFMJ-01-38 dose-dependently reduced locomotor hyperactivity and improved spontaneous alternation behavior in SHR/NCrl; at 5 mg/kg it enhanced novel-object preference and decreased impulsive choice and action, indicating attenuation of ADHD-like symptoms and cognitive enhancement. FMJ-01-54 produced similar improvements in Y-maze and novel-object performance without altering locomotor activity or impulsivity of SHR/NCrl, suggesting selective cognitive improvement. In Wistar rats, FMJ-01-38 increased novel-object preference only at the 5 mg/kg dose, while FMJ-01-54 treatment did not produce any significant behavioral effects.\n\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that D4R modulation, through either partial agonism or antagonism, differentially ameliorates ADHD-related behaviors.

Previous research has reported that susceptibility to task-irrelevant visual distractions is associated with visual working memory (WM) capacity.

Methods: In this study, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 72 children with ADHD and 88 typically developing (TD) children across two experiments, during which they performed visual tasks of varying difficulty while task-irrelevant auditory distractors were presented. The mismatch negativity (MMN) amplitude was measured as a neural index of susceptibility to auditory distractors, and the K score was assessed as a behavioral indicator of visual WM capacity. Results: TD children showed opposite patterns across the two experiments: under low audiovisual competition, those with higher visual working memory capacity were more susceptible to task-irrelevant sounds, whereas under high competition, children with lower capacity showed greater susceptibility to distraction. In contrast, children with ADHD showed a stable association, with lower visual WM capacity consistently predicting higher susceptibility to task-irrelevant auditory distractors regardless of competition level.

However, environments may not only differ in terms of when changes occur, but also how they occur: some nonstationary processes in nature exhibit slow drifts over time, while others show more abrupt changes. This raises the question as to whether humans can adapt their learning to reflect the generative structure of their environment. Here, we compared how humans learn in two canonical nonstationary environments: abrupt change points versus gradual random walks. Using a predictive inference task and a unified Bayesian framework, we show across two behavioral experiments that humans adapt their learning normatively between these two environments. Notably, identical prediction errors were interpreted differently across them. Large prediction errors triggered sharp increases in learning rate under change-point but not random-walk dynamics, where small and large errors were more equally weighted. This matched the predictions of a normative Bayesian model, which itself adopted the appropriate generative model for each environment. In addition, we found that humans could dissociate two latent variables that needed to be jointly inferred: the mean and variance (or stochasticity). This was demonstrated by explicit uncertainty reports that closely tracked the current variance, and only showed sustained changes following change points in variance but not mean. Together, these results show that humans adapt their learning strategy to both how and what aspects of the environment are changing.

In particular, we observed spontaneous membrane binding of the domain in two distinct orientations, top and side, defined by the relative positioning of the C2 domain to its fold. These modes display markedly different dynamical properties: the top mode enables faster lateral diffusion on the membrane surface, whereas the side mode establishes more stable but less mobile contacts. Interestingly, pathogenic missense mutations mapping to the membrane-facing loops of SynGAP C2 disrupt these dynamics, leading to reduced diffusivity and altered membrane avidity.

This study examined how sleep duration influences encoding-retrieval similarity (ERS) and memory performance across the adult lifespan. Fifty-five adults (18-79 years) participated in a seven-day protocol, combining actigraphy-based sleep monitoring with EEG and memory assessments during a paired associate learning task. Significant correlations between sleep duration and ERS were observed, with clusters showing positive and negative associations across brain regions. In match context trials, ERS in the left frontal region correlated with sleep duration, and age moderated these effects. In mismatch context trials, positive correlations were identified in the left posterior, left frontal, and right posterior regions. These results highlight the role of sleep in modulating neural reactivation patterns during memory retrieval and emphasize the influence of age.

M.", "abstract": "Relapse to drug use, even after years of successful rehabilitation, remains a challenge in treating substance use disorders. Drug-associated cues, stress, or the drug itself can trigger episodes of relapse. In rodent models of drug use disorders, cue-drug memories are enhanced through the expression of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) in nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons, emerging after prolonged withdrawal from some forms of drug-conditioned training. Inhibition or removal of these receptors dampens drug-seeking behavior. However, the specific contextual conditions that govern CP-AMPAR expression are unclear. To examine how environmental features influence drug memories, we compared three contextual settings in mice - the conditioned place preference (CPP), open-field (OF), and home-cage (HC) - using the synthetic opioid fentanyl as a model drug. Contrary to the HC condition, where CP-AMPARs were absent, synaptic CP-AMPAR expression was observed in the NAc shell of the CPP and OF groups, both of which involved immediate exposure to an unfamiliar context following drug administration. Moreover, the CPP and OF groups produced comparable increases in CP-AMPAR levels, and CPP mice presented heightened fentanyl-seeking behavior. These findings suggest that contextual unfamiliarity drove synaptic CP-AMPAR expression after drug conditioning, establishing neural substrates that mediate relapse vulnerability. The habituation or avoidance of contextual novelties during medical treatments with opioids may therefore represent a candidate therapeutic approach to reduce relapse risk by limiting the engagement of these critical cellular mechanisms.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we combined a 19-marker multiplex immunofluorescence panel with a machine learning-driven image analysis pipeline to map and quantify over 365 000 cells from paediatric surgical cortex, defining the single-cell architecture of TSC lesions. Microtubers were objectively delineated by vimentin and detected in all TSC samples but absent from non-dysplastic controls. Within these structures, balloon cells exhibiting strong pS6 activation occupied lesion cores and were confined to microtuber boundaries, whereas dysmorphic neurons were more diffusely distributed into adjacent cortex. The microtuber niche was dominated by astroglial remodeling: immature and reactive vimentin-positive astrocytes, including Lamp5-positive subsets, accumulated at and around lesion rims, while mature GFAP-positive astrocytes showed only modest changes. Distance-based spatial analyses revealed neuronal exclusion from microtuber centres with gradual recovery in surrounding tissue, indicating local network disruption. Unsupervised clustering and niche modelling recapitulated these spatial gradients, identifying a glial-dominated ecosystem that concentrates balloon cells, increases inter-neuronal distances, and reduces cell-cell interactions. Together, these data support a model in which cortical tubers arise through the coalescence of microtubers orchestrated by balloon cells and reactive gliosis during corticogenesis. Beyond elucidating disease architecture, our automated framework enables reproducible lesion detection, quantitative cell-state mapping, and spatial readouts applicable across malformations of cortical development.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

We established an immersive virtual reality paradigm that provides direct behavioral read-outs of HD signals. In addition, we developed a biologically inspired HD model, which accommodates noise sources that simulate age-related neural changes. Compared to younger adults, older participants exhibited larger angular errors, and a brief delay increased their heading uncertainty. In addition, our novel ring-attractor architecture shows that synaptic noise and small-scale neuronal loss replicate the magnitude and dynamics of the age-related deficits observed behaviorally. Together, these behavioral and computational findings provide the first evidence that aging compromises the fidelity and stability of the HD system.

Ketamine impaired performance and increased overall firing rates but markedly suppressed saccade-related responses carrying CD signals. This led to decreased discriminability of eye movement signals.

Here, effects of withdrawal from the psychoactive cannabis constituent {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol ({Delta}9-THC) on LHb neurons were assessed with photometric calcium measurement during fear conditioning and in vitro electrophysiology. LHb calcium signals were larger during footshock, and presentation of a tone paired with footshock in {Delta}9-THC withdrawn rats. Fear-induced freezing to the tone was also larger during {Delta}9-THC withdrawal. Electrophysiology revealed larger LHb excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) ratios during {Delta}9-THC withdrawal, resulting from impaired synaptic GABA release. Moreover, GABA release via optogenetic activation of BF-LHb inputs was impaired during {Delta}9-THC withdrawal, whereas no changes occurred at ventral tegmental area-LHb inputs. Recovery of BF-LHb GABA release and cannabinoid CB1 receptor desensitization were incomplete at 30 days of {Delta}9-THC withdrawal. The data show that LHb responsivity to primary aversive and conditioned stimuli are increased during {Delta}9-THC withdrawal, and that this is likely mediated by altered E-I balance.

Large animal models more accurately emulate human disease; however, methods of measuring LBP are not well established. Pigs were also considered unfit for LBP research, due to notochordal cells (NCs) persistence through life, unlike humans. We developed a comprehensive porcine model with quantitative measure of discogenic pain via biobehavioral testing (BBT), MRI, and multi-omics tissue analysis of IVD and DRGs. MRI demonstrated the progression of IVD degeneration beginning at 4 weeks post-injury. BBTs showed the development of significant pain responses by week 4 post-injury, supported by transcriptomics of injury matched DRGs. Single cell transcriptomics, trajectory and cell-cell communication analyses suggest that, with injury, NCs are differentiating to nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs). Furthermore, NPCs showed upregulation of cellular stress, neural outgrowth, and inflammation pathway, consistent with pain-inducing distress signals found in human samples. This study establishes novel MRI and BBT-based methods for quantifying LBP in pigs and supports its translational relevance to human discogenic LBP. The identification of LBP-associated clusters mirrors our previous finding in humans.

Principal component analysis revealed substantial overlap between groups, indicating that increasing cirrhosis severity produces incremental rather than global proteomic shifts. Nevertheless, 295 proteins showed significant differential abundance (Hedge's g > 0.3, p < 0.05), including upregulation of HMOX1 and LRSAM1 and downregulation of CYP27A1 in Medium/High cirrhosis.

R.", "abstract": "Chronic neuropathic pain (CNP) develops as a result of persistent neuroinflammation and maladaptive synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system following nerve injury. While tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) signaling has been extensively studied in pain resolution, the expression of this receptor on specific neuronal populations and molecular pathways involved in spontaneous pain recovery still remains poorly defined. In this study, we investigated the role of TNFR2 signaling within hippocampal Nex/Neurod6 pyramidal neurons in promoting recovery from chronic constriction injury (CCI), a well-established rodent model of neuropathic pain. To achieve neuron-specific deletion of TNFR2, we generated tamoxifen-inducible conditional knockout mice (NexCreERT2:TNFR2F/F). We demonstrate that knocking out TNFR2 from Nex neurons prevents spontaneous pain recovery in both males and females. Thus, establishing that a supraspinal TNFR2 neuroimmune axis is necessary for pain recovery. Exogenous administration of a TNFR2 agonist at 7, 10, and 13 dpi (i.p.) significantly improved mechanical withdrawal thresholds in both sexes of wild-type mice but did not alleviate pain in Nex-specific TNFR2 knockouts, indicating that neuronal TNFR2 expression is required for TNFR2-mediated analgesia. Bulk RNA sequencing of hippocampal tissue collected at six weeks after CCI revealed that TNFR2 activation upregulates genes such as Pomc, involved in the opioid pathway, and oleoyl-ACP-hydrolase (OLAH), involved in the endocannabinoid pathway. Consistent with these findings, immunostaining and Western blot analyses showed that TNFR2 agonism restored cornu ammonis (CA3) region POMC and {beta}-endorphin protein levels that were otherwise suppressed after CCI. Behavioral experiment demonstrated that systemic blockade of the {micro}-opioid receptor with naltrexone (administered daily from 7-21 dpi (s.c.)) completely prevented TNFR2-mediated pain recovery in males but only partially in females. In contrast, inhibition of cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) signaling with AM251 (administered at 7, 14, and 21 dpi (i.p.)) abolished TNFR2-driven analgesia in both sexes. Together, these results reveal that hippocampal TNFR2 signaling in Nex/Neurod6 neurons is critical in recovery from chronic neuropathic pain. TNFR2 activation promotes analgesia by engaging endogenous {beta}-endorphin/{micro}-opioid and endocannabinoid pathways in a sex-dependent manner, establishing TNFR2 agonism as a promising non-addictive therapeutic approach for chronic pain resolution.\n\nSignificanceChronic neuropathic pain (CNP) results from persistent neuroimmune signaling and is driven by maladaptive circuit plasticity. Due to the complexity of factors contributing to CNP, it often leaves patients with few treatment options, which, unfortunately, are either temporary or might be addictive. We have characterized a novel supraspinal mechanism through which tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2) signaling, specifically in hippocampal Neurod6/Nex+ expressing pyramidal neurons, is necessary for pain recovery following nerve injury. Pharmacological activation of TNFR2 in these neurons alleviates pain by engaging both endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid signaling pathways. We specifically demonstrate that TNFR2 agonism upregulates proopiomelanocortin (POMC) expression and {beta}-endorphin levels in the hippocampus. We further identify that pharmacological inhibition of either the -opioid receptor or cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor is sufficient to impair the effectiveness of TNFR2 agonist mediated pain resolution. Our findings thus uncover a novel neuroimmune mechanism where the TNFR2 agonist, exogenously activating the pro-resolving TNFR2, mitigates CNP by releasing endogenous pain neuromodulators. Here, we highlight that TNFR2 agonism could serve as a non-addictive therapeutic strategy for the resolution of chronic neuropathic pain.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Recent work has revealed similar oscillations (termed 'sleep-like slow waves') following stroke in brain regions close or connected to a brain lesion, offering a plausible but untested mechanism for stroke-related behavioural impairment. Here, we simultaneously recorded EEG and behavioural performance while 30 unilateral stroke patients (12 left hemisphere, 18 right hemisphere) and 27 age-matched healthy adults completed a computerised perceptual decision-making task. Sleep-like slow waves occurred more frequently in stroke patients relative to healthy controls. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between slow wave occurrence and the accuracy and speed of perceptual reports in stroke patients, suggesting that variations in the occurrence of slow waves may contribute to cognitive heterogeneity post-stroke. Evidence that sleep-like slow waves predict deficits in perceptual decision-making following stroke indicates that stroke-induced lesions can destabilize cortical networks extending beyond the damaged regions, thereby contributing to broader cognitive impairments.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

We identified elevated densities of peripheral nerves and Osterix positive (Osx+) osteoprogenitors in critical-sized defects, while osteogenic differentiation markers were severely diminished. Moreover, Osx+ osteoprogenitors in critical-sized defects exhibited enhanced proximity to peripheral nerves, which in turn was associated with increased osteoprogenitor cell proliferation. Using retrograde tracing in conjunction with single cell RNA-sequencing of sensory nerves from the innervating trigeminal ganglia, genes encoding for nerve-secreted proliferative and anti-differentiation factors were identified. Specifically, FGF-1/FGFR-1 signaling was identified as a significant neuroskeletal interaction with critical-sized defects demonstrating higher FGF-1 expression in fluorescence imaging. Presence of FGF-1 in neurons innervating the calvarial was confirmed, and neural conditioned media depleted for FGF1 showed enhanced induction of osteogenesis when placed on parietal bone cells.

MARRVEL exemplifies this challenge by requiring precise queries (e.g., HGVS notation) and returning complex, difficult-to-synthesize outputs. To address this input-output asymmetry, we developed MARRVEL-MCP, a natural language interface enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform end-to-end variant interpretation via structured tool access. This work demonstrates the impact of context engineering-the deliberate design of domain-aware tool environments and information scaffolding in reshaping the role of model scale in genomics. MARRVEL-MCP equips LLMs with 39 tools spanning gene and variant utilities, pathogenicity databases, phenotype resources, expression atlases, ortholog data, and literature APIs. Without hard-coded pipelines, LLMs autonomously infer workflows, performing named-entity recognition, identifier normalization, and multi-database synthesis from narrative queries. Using 45 expert-curated questions, lightweight models (3B-20B parameters) with MARRVEL-MCP matched or outperformed larger models lacking tool access. A 20B-parameter model (gpt-oss-20b) achieved a 95% pass rate versus 33% without MARRVEL-MCP, approaching state-of-the-art proprietary performance. Although accuracy remains below the 100% required for autonomous diagnosis and token usage is considerable, these results show that well-designed context can compensate for limited model capacity.

Purpose: To compare the predictive performance of conventional 2D DCE-MRI-based radiomics models with advanced 3D DCE-MRI-based radiomics models for determining estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and Ki-67 expression in breast cancer patients. Material and Methods: This study included 385 patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer. Semi-automatic segmentation was applied to delineate regions of interest (ROIs) on DCE-MRI images, and radiomic features were extracted using Intelligence Foundry (IF) 3.1. Feature selection involved single-value filtering, correlation analysis, outlier optimization, normalization, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Logistic regression was used for statistical analysis, and model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA), and DeLong's test for comparing 2D and 3D models. Results: The 3D models consistently outperformed 2D models across all biomarkers. In the validation set, the 3D models achieved AUCs of 0.884 for ER, 0.861 for PR, 0.898 for HER-2, and 0.886 for Ki-67, while the 2D models yielded AUCs of 0.813 (ER), 0.740 (PR), 0.821 (HER-2), and 0.796 (Ki-67). DCA demonstrated greater net clinical benefit for 3D models, and DeLong's test revealed statistically significant differences between 2D and 3D models (p < 0.05) for all biomarker groups. Discussion: Both 2D and 3D DCE-MRI radiomics models demonstrated substantial potential for predicting molecular marker expression in breast cancer.

Oscillatory dynamics in the theta and alpha bands are central to these adaptations, but their distinct roles across maintenance, manipulation, and recall remain unclear. We examined behavioural and neural differences in WM using electroencephalography (EEG) during verbal (Letter Span) and visuospatial (Corsi Block) tasks under retention and manipulation conditions. Behaviourally, older adults preserved performance in the Letter Span but showed deficits in the Corsi Test, suggesting domain-specific declines, while higher task demands reduced accuracy across both groups. At the neural level, younger adults exhibited stronger mid-frontal and temporal theta activity, supporting more efficient recruitment of WM processes and stronger performance associations. Older adults showed attenuated theta power, indicative of neural saturation, and appeared to compensate through alpha-mediated mechanisms during the delay period (maintenance/manipulation): reduced alpha suppression in the Letter Span facilitated rehearsal and updating, whereas increased upper alpha in the Corsi Test protected stored visuospatial information. These findings suggest theta oscillations underpin core WM functions, whereas alpha oscillations flexibly support compensatory strategies in ageing.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

To cope with such stresses, they have evolved complex mechanisms of transcriptional reprogramming. While various cold-responsive pathways have been described, the contribution of chromatin-level regulation, and in particular histone modifications, remains largely obscure. Here, we identify the histone methyltransferase SET DOMAIN GROUP 26 (SDG26) as a positive regulator of cold stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that SDG26 is transcriptionally induced and post-transcriptionally stabilized by cold, and that its loss of function leads to increased freezing tolerance but reduced drought tolerance. At the molecular level, SDG26 promotes expression of cold-responsive genes, including members of the CBF-COR regulon, through direct binding and histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3) at their chromatin. Concomitantly, SDG26 modulates abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, catabolism, and transport, thereby promoting ABA accumulation, stomatal closure, and drought tolerance. Collectively, our results reveal that SDG26 integrates ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways to fine-tune Arabidopsis responses to abiotic stresses. We further establish SDG26 as a chromatin modifier contributing to stress-responsive H3K36me3 enrichment at specific loci. Together, our work identifies SDG26 as a chromatin-based hub balancing cold acclimation with water conservation, thereby enhancing plant resilience.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Because chloroplasts generate reactive oxygen species and contain lipids rich in unsaturated fatty acids, they are likely major sites of oxylipin carbonyl formation in leaves. To identify chloroplast-derived carbonyl species and their suborganellar localization, we performed a comprehensive analysis of carbonyls in spinach leaves, whole chloroplasts, thylakoids, envelopes, and stroma. A total of 22 carbonyl species were detected, of which 12 were identified. The chloroplast contained 16 species, including formaldehyde, propionaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, butyraldehyde, (E)-2-pentenal, (Z)-3-hexenal, (E)-2-hexenal, n-hexanal, and 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-hexenal. The thylakoid membrane contained all carbonyls found in the chloroplast except acetone, indicating that it is the primary site of carbonyl generation. Estimated concentrations of these carbonyls in the membrane reached approximately 2 mM. Importantly, our results demonstrate for the first time that formaldehyde is produced within chloroplasts and originates from membrane lipids.

While some theories propose that movement and decision are jointly invigorated to maximize a global utility (e.g., mixing reward, effort, and time), alternative perspectives suggest that the brain can separately invigorate them when advantageous. We tested these competing hypotheses using a foraging-like task that allowed experimentally assessing the vigor of movement (reaching to reward location) and that of decision-making (harvesting reward). By using a block-wise design, we measured the effects of independent manipulations of time and effort on reach and harvest durations. Decoupled effects were found on reach and harvest durations, with no inter-individual consistency between them. A model that separately optimized movement and decision vigor predicted these results better than a global utility model. These findings support the separate control hypothesis, indicating that distinct time-cost signals (sensitive to recent temporal history) may invigorate movement and decision. We conclude that movement and decision vigor is only indirectly linked, with any apparent co-regulation arising when both are governed by a shared temporal signal reflecting a common cost of time.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

In this study, we aimed to characterize the changes in hippocampal network activity induced by a potentially epileptogenic insult. In rats, long-lasting electrical perforant pathway stimulation leads in a high percentage of animals to the development of temporal lobe epilepsy. However, a subset of animals remains resilient against the stimulation. We monitored alterations of neuronal activity by chronically recording the local field potential (LFP) from the hippocampal dentate gyrus before, during and after the potentially epileptogenic insult. Intriguingly, epilepsy animals identified by subsequent spontaneous epileptic seizures were characterized by a transient increase in the aperiodic exponent suggesting a shift towards a reduced local excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) ratio during the first days after the perforant path stimulation. Furthermore, these animals developed a strong impairment of theta oscillation prevalence and regularity during early epileptogenesis. In contrast, resilient non-epilepsy animals without spontaneous seizures neither showed this modulation in E/I ratio nor a corruption of hippocampal theta activity. In fact, the increase in the aperiodic exponent on the first day after completion of the electrical stimulation paradigm could predict epileptogenesis with very high fidelity (AUC 0.92) and correlated significantly with later seizure rate. This finding opens the opportunity to dissect mechanisms of epileptogenesis and to test the effectiveness of anti-epileptogenesis treatment in very early disease stages by allowing identification of individuals at high risk. Furthermore, it might offer a potential explanation for the frequently observed failure of anti-epileptogenesis drugs boosting GABAergic inhibition.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Yet, key differences remain between how DCNNs and humans, particularly infants, learn to recognize faces. In this study, we present a developmentally-inspired model that addresses three critical gaps between humans and standard DCNNs: (1) DCNNs are trained via one-time batch learning, whereas infants encounter faces gradually over time; (2) DCNNs are trained on thousands of face images with high variability of static images for each identity, while infants are initially exposed to a small number of identities, often limited to close caregivers, through a continuous, dynamic stream of visual input with lower within-identity variability; (3) The goal of DCNNs is to recognize untrained (unfamiliar) faces, while the goal of human face system is to recognize familiar faces. To better approximate developmental face learning, we introduce a model comprising three interacting modules: an Embedder - a DCNN trained to encode face identity continually on up to 10 identities, based on images taken from videos of a TV series; an Autoencoder used for generative memory-replay, to construct images of missing identities in each training phase; and a Memory module - stores identity-specific latent codes. Results show that this model achieves recognition performance comparable to batch-trained DCNNs.

Alternatively, cryopreservation of dissociated embryonic cells allows to biobank diploid genomes. However, amphibian and fish embryos have cells of varying sizes throughout the developing embryo and cell size distribution remains understudied in cryopreservation. This study examined cell size effects during cryopreservation of dissociated embryonic cells from two amphibian species. Most work used Limnodynatses peronii blastula, gastrula, and neurula cells cryopreserved with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and sucrose at 0%, 1%, or 10%. Increasing sucrose concentration improved post-thaw recovery of membrane intact cells and cell concentrations, with gastrula and neurula cells having better recovery than blastula cells. An interaction amongst cryoprotectant concentration, cell size, and embryonic stage was observed. Higher sucrose improved recovery of larger cells, but reduced recovery of smaller cells. These results supported a \"Goldilocks\" model of cryoinjury, in which larger cells require more time to dehydrate adequately, while smaller cells are damaged by excessive dehydration and solute effects, implying that optimal cryoprotectant conditions differ by cell size. Based on post-thaw recovery, 10% DMSO + 10% sucrose was optimal and successfully applied to the cryopreservation of neurula cells from the threatened Rawlinsonia littlejohni, marking the first report of embryonic cell cryopreservation in a threatened amphibian.

To overcome these barriers, we developed sulfonate-functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs), referred to as (SO3-)-MSN-PEG/TA, as a multifunctional nanocarrier for IRI delivery. This nanoformulation markedly enhanced drug loading efficiency and preserved over 90% of the lactone form for up to six months, enabling sustained release and improved pharmacological stability. In vitro studies demonstrated superior cellular uptake, enhanced apoptosis, and a reduced IC compared to free IRI. Beyond drug delivery, (SO3-)-MSN-PEG/TA exhibited intrinsic antimetastatic activity by modulating focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/paxillin signaling, thereby impairing cell migration and suppressing angiogenesis, along with efficient tumor accumulation through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. Pharmacokinetic analysis further revealed that IRI@(SO3-)-MSN-PEG/TA prolonged systemic retention, maintaining higher IRI plasma concentrations compared with free IRI. IRI@(SO3-)-MSN-PEG/TA significantly inhibited both primary tumor growth and metastatic dissemination in orthotopic and heterotopic colorectal cancer models, while markedly reducing systemic toxicities and preserving bone marrow cellularity relative to free IRI and liposomal IRI (Onivyde).

Our work demonstrates that in Vhl-deficient macrophages, both HIF-1 and HIF-2 contribute to AM defective self-renewal, while HIF-2 plays a central role in regulating the impaired AM maturation associated with pVHL loss. HIF-1 promotes a glycolytic shift in alveolar macrophages, while HIF-2 hinders lipid oxidation and surfactant clearance. Thus, HIF-2 raises as a selective critical factor restraining the therapeutic potential of AMs to degrade surfactant excess in mice that have developed pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP).

The modification of eating habits towards more environmentally friendly and healthy diets is a key lever to meet this challenge. In 2019, the EAT-Lancet commission defined a universal guideline diet that should allow 9 billion people across the globe to eat healthily while respecting the planet boundaries. In an attempt to reconnect cropping systems to such diets, we developed an innovative approach and designed a decision-making model to assist in the planning and optimization of cropping systems. This model evaluates their ability to supply a specific food system in accordance with the diet recommended by the EAT-Lancet Commission, while comparing vegan, ovo-lacto vegetarian, and omnivorous diets and minimizing the import and export of food and feed commodities. Results show that longer and more diverse crop rotations are more likely to comply with the EAT-Lancet dietary requirements, especially if grazing animals are integrated within rotations. Integrated crop-livestock systems including temporary pasture and forage cover crops minimize the excess and deficit of all commodities (food and feed supplies), while reaching the required amount of daily calories and meeting the requirements in each food category. Crop rotations typically need to include rapeseed to provide oil for human consumption and oilseed meals for livestock, as well as a legume crop for pulses and several cereals. The model allows testing a wider range of dietary recommendations or assessing the impact of specific agro-ecological practices on crops. It supports the design of innovative, multi-objective crop rotations aligned with dietary guidelines.

Simulation-based inference (SBI) offers a powerful alternative by leveraging model simulations in place of explicit likelihood evaluations. However, traditional SBI approaches such as Approximate Bayesian Computation often rely on ad-hoc summary statistics and suffer from reduced efficiency in high-dimensional settings. Recent advances in SBI address these limitations by employing flexible statistical or machine-learning surrogates to approximate likelihoods or posterior distributions, improving scalability and accuracy. Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), in particular, employs neural density estimators to learn the posterior directly from simulated data, automatically extracting informative representations without requiring handcrafted statistics. Despite its promise, NPE has seen limited application in infectious disease epidemiology and phylodynamics. In this study, we assess the ability of NPE to infer parameters in mechanistic models of infectious disease dynamics. Using data from the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak in Sierra Leone, we present two case studies reflecting common outbreak-analysis scenarios. First, we fit a compartmental Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered transmission model to time series of reported cases and deaths. Second, we fit a Birth & Death phylodynamic model with exposed and infectious hosts to an early Ebola virus phylogeny. In both applications, NPE produces accurate and reliable posterior estimates. We further show that the amortized nature of NPE facilitates model calibration and criticism, enabling rapid assessment of model fit across multiple datasets. Our results highlight the potential of NPE as a flexible, scalable, and statistically principled tool for epidemiological and phylodynamic inference.

We show here that Ca++ spikes are detected in dystrophic myogenic cells in culture since early differentiation, before sarcomere assembly and contraction. Healthy and genetically corrected dystrophic myotubes do not display Ca++ spikes which are blocked by co-culturing DMD myogenic cells with embryonic mouse motoneurons or treating them with agrin proteoglycan. Same effect is elicited by a muscle spliced, COOH peptide of agrin (termed here mini-agrin) that interacts with dystroglycan, favouring its binding to the basal lamina. Lack of dystrophin in DMD myotubes results in decreased expression of CaV1.1 (CACNA1S), a Ca++ sensor component of the Dihydropyridine Receptor (DHPR) complex, known to regulate Ryanodine Receptor 1 (RyR1). These events explain the emergence of Ca++ spikes. Mini-agrin addition to medium, or lentivector-mediated mini-agrin expression in transplanted cells in vivo, stabilize the expression of CaV1.1 on the membrane. This leads to disappearance of Ca++ spikes and to reappearance of lower case Greek alpha-dystroglycan, alpha-sarcoglycan and n-NOS, indicating the reconstitution of the dystrophin complex in the absence of dystrophin. These findings unveil a novel regulatory mechanism and offer a new therapeutic opportunity for targeting calcium ion influx as a co-treatment strategy.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Encountering their cognate antigen triggers their activation, leading to an increase in cell size, proliferation, enhanced protein production, and secretion of signaling molecules. This activation and clonal expansion phase is followed by a contraction phase, with a reduction in cell size, eventually leading to cell death or progression to resting (memory) cells. Here, we show that human resting primary CD4+ memory T cells degrade endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial portions via ER-phagy and mitophagy, respectively. The temporary interruption of ER and mitochondria turnover coupled with a transient induction of the unfolded protein response results in the enlargement of the ER and cellular volume. Cell growth is stabilized and then reversed during the clonal expansion and contraction phases by the resumption of a catabolic phase characterized by the reactivation of ER-phagy and outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM)-phagy. Collectively, our data show that the maintenance and the activity of human CD4+ memory T cells rely on finely tuned execution of anabolic and catabolic programs that regulate mass and activity of the ER and mitochondria.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Approximately 20% of DMGs harbor truncating mutations in exon 6 of phosphatase PPM1D, which stabilize the protein and deregulate p53 signaling. However, the consequences of these mutations for tumor initiation, progression, and therapy remain unclear. We developed a conditional Ppm1d-loxP-exon6-loxP-exon6-E518X-tag mouse allele (Ppm1d-flex-6) that enables lineage-, spatial-, and temporal-specific expression of a DMG-derived truncated Ppm1d protein from its endogenous locus in the presence of Cre-recombinase. Ubiquitous activation of mutant Ppm1d was modeled using the Meox2-Cre driver, and primary gliomas were modeled using the RCAS/tv-a system to introduce Cre and PDGFB co-drivers into Nestin-positive neural stem cells. Complementary studies were performed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing truncated Ppm1d following Cre recombination. While Meox2-Cre-driven ubiquitous recombination of Ppm1d-flex-6 produced muted phenotypes, Ppm1d-flex-6 recombination in Nestin+ neural stem cells accelerated gliomagenesis. Its oncogenic effect was weaker than complete p53 loss, and it did not accelerate tumorigenesis further in p53-null tumors. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed that Ppm1d-flex-6 gliomas adopt more progenitor-like transcriptional states and upregulate p53- and cell cycle associated pathways. In MEFs, Ppm1d-flex-6 enhanced proliferation and shifted transcriptomic programs toward MAPK and PI3K-Akt signaling, while impairing DNA damage responses, including reduced {gamma}-H2AX induction after irradiation. These defects sensitized cells to radiation and decreased clonogenic survival after ionizing radiation and PARP inhibition. Ppm1d mutations confer intermediate suppression of the p53 pathway, consistent with the clinical features of PPM1D-mutant DMGs and are associated with radiosensitivity and PARP inhibitor vulnerability.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

The conventional approach of testing each variant against each molecular feature independently suffers from severe multiple testing burden and ignores linkage disequilibrium and spatial correlation. Existing fine-mapping methods only partially address these challenges and are suboptimal for analyzing such datasets: multivariate approaches such as mvSuSiE jointly analyze multiple molecular contexts but are designed for a single trait value per context and cannot accommodate thousands of base-resolution measurements per context, while functional approaches such as fSuSiE model spatial structure across thousands of measurements but analyze each context separately. Here, we introduce mfSuSiE, which integrates multivariate analysis with wavelet-based functional regression to jointly fine-map thousands of base-resolution traits across multiple cell types. In simulations, mfSuSiE identified causal variants and affected molecular features more accurately than fSuSiE, while mvSuSiE cannot be applied to this type of data. Applied to single-nucleus chromatin accessibility data from six brain cell types from postmortem aging human brains, mfSuSiE substantially increased discovery and resolution, with substantial power gains for cell types with limited samples. Multi-cell-type analysis revealed extensive sharing of regulatory effects on chromatin accessibility (caQTL). Importantly, mfSuSiE produces Bayesian inference compatible with the SuSiE framework, enabling systematic multi-omic integration.

However, previous work has shown that an overly aggressive ME-ICA denoising approach may unintentionally remove task-related signal, while a more conservative approach may not effectively mitigate noise. While the effects of varied implementations of ME-ICA on signal and noise characteristics have been tested thoroughly in breath-hold data, the effects of similar modeling decisions have not been studied in motor-task data, which present with a more localized neural response. Here, we tested and compared the impacts of three analysis methods using rejected ME-ICA components as regressors in subject-level modeling: Aggressive (simple inclusion of ME-ICA regressors), Moderate (excluding task-correlated ME-ICA regressors from the model), and Conservative (orthogonalization of ME-ICA regressors to the base model and accepted ME-ICA components). We applied these methods to data from healthy and multiple sclerosis populations that included performance of hand-grasp, shoulder-abduction, and ankle-flexion tasks. We found that when the amount of head motion and its correlation with the task was high and the expected task-evoked signal was relatively low, the Conservative method led to significantly higher activation, t-statistics, and test-retest reliability in motor regions compared to the Aggressive and Moderate methods. Future motor-task studies may wish to implement similar models to prevent loss of motor signal, while still mitigating the effects of task-correlated head motion.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of novel approaches to improve responses through more complete embolization and targeting ischemia-induced molecular dependencies. To build on these findings, we developed an injectable chitosan-based hydrogel system (AuNP-Lys05-gel) that we hypothesized might be a more effective embolic material by (i) enabling a more complete filling of tumor feeding blood vessels in a cast-like manner, (ii) encapsulating Lys05, a potent autophagy inhibitor, and (iii) providing X-ray contrast for direct visualization of the embolization. Chitosan hydrogels of varying composition were formed and characterized. We found that Lys05 could be loaded in this type of hydrogel and that it was released gradually over 7 days. We found that AuNP was better retained by the hydrogel than iopamidol, an FDA-approved contrast agent, indicating that AuNP would provide longer-lasting CT monitoring. In a rat model of HCC, AuNP-Lys05-gel reduced tumor growth and resulted in a 67% objective response rate vs 26% for a clinically used particle embolic.

Colletotrichum graminicola, the causal agent of maize anthracnose, secretes effector proteins to manipulate host defences and promote colonization. Building on previous work characterizing the nuclear effector CgEP1, we characterized its paralog CgEP4, which is highly conserved across strains of C. graminicola. Phylogenetic analysis of the two genes and their homologs in other species revealed that they originated from a gene duplication event approximately 28 to 18 million years ago, predating the diversification of the Graminicola species complex. This timing aligns with the ecological expansion of C4 grasses, suggesting that the functional divergence of these effectors was an adaptive response to facilitate the colonization of emerging monocot hosts. Functional characterization using gene deletion mutants demonstrated that CgEP4 has a critical role in pathogenicity, characterized by a significant reduction in virulence, delayed penetration, enhanced papilla formation, and decreased fungal biomass. This virulence defect is associated with compromised host colonization and a failure to suppress basal host defences. In the absence of CgEP4, the pathogen also showed defects in general fungal physiology and stress tolerance. Overall, our findings establish CgEP4 as a new, essential nuclear-localized effector that promotes fungal entry and colonization by manipulating host responses.

To investigate how mitochondrial dynamics influence cellular behavior in pancreatic beta-cells, we developed a rule-based, multi-level simulation model of insulin secretion. The pancreatic beta cell model encompasses metabolic pathways (glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation), compartmental processes (mitochondrial fusion and fission), and cellular processes (insulin secretion), allowing for the investigation of their interplay. The rule-based simulation model captures the high plasticity of these organelles and integrates and builds upon insights from various experimental studies and previous simulation models. Its rule-based specification facilitates the exploration of new hypotheses, the integration of new knowledge and data, and the successive extension of the model. The results of our simulation experiments underscore the importance of peripheral, sorted mitochondrial fission in maintaining mitochondrial health. Downregulation of the fission-associated anchor proteins Fis1 and MFF impacts mitochondrial structure and function differently, highlighting their distinct roles in maintaining mitochondrial health and cellular biogenesis, respectively. With respect to insulin secretion, Drp1 suppression shows that beta cells become unresponsive to glucose, whereas Fis1 downregulation only attenuates the cellular response. The simulation model and simulation results corroborate experimental findings and contribute to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved in mitochondrial dynamics of pancreatic beta cells and their relation to metabolic dysregulation in type 2 diabetes mellitus.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Birds were subjected to a 21-day dietary exposure of TMX-treated seeds at 0 (control), 0.027 (low), 0.33 (medium), and 4.3 (high) g TMX/kg seed (N=8 per group), representative of typical agricultural practices. A dose-dependent increase in seed consumption was observed in the latter stages of the experiment, suggesting compensatory feeding that amplifies toxicant intake. Notably, the high-dose group exhibited 50% mortality, an unexpected finding of concern given TMX's classification as of low acute toxicity. High-dose birds displayed significant body mass reduction (-20.5%) and impaired anti-predator responsiveness. Furthermore, general activity patterns were altered across all treated groups. At a physiological level, TMX exposure in the high-dose group induced reduced hematocrit and decreased polychromasia. Tissue-specific modulations in enzymatic biomarkers, including elevated cholinesterase and glutathione S-transferase activities, indicated oxidative stress and cholinergic alterations.

The arginine containing peptides, poly-PR and poly-GR, are particularly noxious to cells. Both have been shown to undergo cell-cell transmission, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. We found rapid internalization and nucleolar localization of bath-applied hemagglutinin (HA) tagged poly-PR with twenty repeats (HA-PR20) in cell lines and neurons. Small molecule and RNAi approaches implicated a temperature-dependent, fluid phase endocytosis mechanism in HA-PR20 uptake. We sought to identify DPR-related cell surface uptake factors using a high-resolution proximity labeling technique developed in the MacMillan group, termed Map. DPR-iridium conjugates identified candidate cell-surface proteins which were interrogated in an RNAi screen. Focusing on our strongest candidate, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4), we showed that cellular uptake of HA-PR20 is blocked by inhibition of glycosaminoglycan chain synthesis (using drugs or RNAi) and knockdown or ablation of CSPG4 (using RNAi or CRISPR editing). Reduction of CSPG4 protected PR20-induced neuronal toxicity. We used a dual reporter system to interrogate in vitro neuron-to-neuron transmission of PR50 and found that PR50 synthesized by one neuron readily spread to neighboring neurons. Transmission was significantly reduced when CSPG4 was knocked down. These results suggest CSPG4 is an important factor in poly-PR internalization and transmission and therefore may be a therapeutic target to slow DPR transmission and disease progression.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

This analysis found that body-specific knockdown of CCHa2 significantly reduced sleep duration and sleep depth in fed flies, phenocopying sleep in starved flies. CCHa2-deficient flies exhibited reduced glycogen stores and diminished feeding drive. Analysis of single-cell transcriptomic atlases confirms that the CCHa2 receptor (CCHa2-R) is selectively expressed in Insulin Producing Cells (IPCs) of the fly brain. We find that knockdown of CCHa2-R in IPCs recapitulates the sleep loss phenotype of CCHa2 mutants, supporting a role in adipose-brain signaling. Further screening of genes identified in single cell atlases as being enriched in IPCs led to the identification of numerous genes that function in IPCs to regulate sleep including modulators of wnt and insulin signaling.

This study examines how spatial structures -- grid, random, small-world, and scale-free networks -- interact with dispersal rates to influence ecosystem recovery and mutualistic network persistence. We find that with low dispersal, restoration cost is similar across spatial structures, but at intermediate dispersal rates, scale-free networks show faster recovery and smaller restoration costs. At high dispersal rates, increased connectivity initially reduces restoration cost; however, over time, homogenization weakens spatial heterogeneity, causing restoration cost to increase. Importantly, increasing nestedness can delay collapse but also extends the recovery distance, making ecosystems harder to restore. By adjusting dispersal rates and transitioning from homogeneous to heterogeneous spatial structures, we can decrease restoration cost and improve ecosystem stability, offering key insights for ecological management strategies.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

We introduce the Adaptive Partial Conjunction Hypothesis (APCH), an empirical Bayes framework that uses summary statistics to test, for each effect unit, which subsets of features are jointly non-null while controlling the false discovery rate for subset selection. APCH combines adaptive shrinkage priors with a hierarchical model that accounts for correlation among effect estimates and computes local false discovery rates for all candidate subsets. A top--down search over subset size then selects at most one maximally informative jointly significant subset per effect unit. In simulations, APCH maintained well-calibrated FDR and, in most settings, achieved higher power than both empirical Bayes methods that learn across effects and subset-based procedures that test each effect unit separately. It remained reliable with heterogeneous effect sizes, correlated estimation errors across features, and sparse jointly significant patterns. We apply APCH to GWAS summary statistics for five type 2 diabetes--related traits and identify co-occurring trait subsets that go beyond what single-trait genome-wide scans reveal. In particular, APCH brings in traits that fall short of genome-wide significance on their own but repeatedly appear in the same jointly significant subsets, revealing stable cross-trait co-association patterns and sharpening our overall picture of how loci act across these traits.

The approach relies on signal-dependent noise (SDN), where the expected variance and mean (i.e., the signal) are functionally related. SDN variations in different image data representations caused degradation in the algorithm's performance; this work addressed this problem. Image data used in the analysis were from three breast cancer case-control studies employing different mammographic technologies i.e., full field digital mammography (including raw and clinical images) and digital breast tomosynthesis. Advancements demonstrated that the algorithm produced significant odds ratios across all image data representations by adding these capabilities: (1) the ability to transform noise to a specific optimized quadric SDN form given an arbitrary image data representation; and (2) the ability to perform ensemble averaging over a given image, boosting the signal. We also demonstrated methods to combine measurements from different technologies using a probability density transformation approach. The technique can be applied to images from different technologies with minimal adjustments thereby making it suitable for both research and clinical applications.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Conventional collagens of animal origin raise concerns regarding ethics, safety, and sustainability. As a vegan alternative, we report on the production of a 30 kDa prolyl-hydroxylated human collagen polypeptide from Physcomitrella moss plants. For secretion-based production and formulation compatibility, a hydrophilic region encompassing 334 amino acids from human type III collagen was selected, which includes four protein domains involved in cell adhesion, collagen binding, integrin recognition and wound healing. Transgenic moss lines were generated via PEG-mediated protoplast transformation. Immunodetection identified collagen polypeptide-producing lines, and mass spectrometric analysis validated the product and confirmed its prolyl-hydroxylation. The presence of this important post-translational modification underscores the high biomimetic quality of the product derived from moss. To enable industrial-scale production, the transformants were quantitatively analysed at the genomic, transcript, and protein levels. The most productive lines were forwarded to process development, where culture conditions including CO2 supplementation, pH, and light intensity were optimized. Upscaling to 5 L photobioreactors established a robust, light- and biomass-dependent production regime that yielded nearly 1 mg/L of secreted collagen polypeptide after 11 days of cultivation. Taken together, this study presents the first scalable moss-based production of a post-translationally modified human collagen and offers a sustainable and vegan alternative to conventional collagens. This highlights the versatility of Physcomitrella as a production host for high-quality proteins with industrial applicability that also meet consumer requirements.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Maize is an important cereal crop of Pakistan and majorly grown in Punjab under Spring and Autumn seasons. There is a temperature shift in both seasons which bring a stress on crop plant, as a result of which the yield of the hybrids drops drastically due to failure of pollinations or heat coupled with drought causes reduced seed growth and hence less yield. This makes maize yield unstable over the years and keeps the farmer at risk. Current study was proposed keeping the above situation in mind. shsp-17 from Nicotiana tabacum and ATHSP- 90 from Arabidopsis thaliana have been transformed in maize to play its role under biotic and abiotic stresses. Though maize plant also produces them, the target was to enhance the natural production of these proteins by genetic engineering in maize. In planta transformation protocols were equipped for the recovery of transgenic plants carrying reporter gene and gene of interest (sHSP-17). Putative transgenic plants for HSP-90 were not achieved, at this we compared tissue culture/regeneration after bombarding immature zygotic embryos with selectable marker gene and found out that the said gene was perhaps deleterious for plant survival. The transgenic plants carrying reporter gene were checked for the presence of reporter protein by providing enzyme substrate which proved the transformation and expression of reporter gene for protein. The transgenic plants carrying sHSP-17 were grown till maturity, confirmation for the presence of gene in maize genome was done using PCR and Southern blot while expression was checked using reverse transcriptase PCR. Seed of the transgenic plants were grown to get T1 generation which were found to be unable to attain maturity and produce progeny. It indicates that may be the expression of this gene too was deleterious for embryo survival and only those seeds could be developed where transgene was not available due to normal gene reshuffling during sexual reproduction.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Compared to growth at 22{degrees}C, at 31{degrees}C, primary root growth, meristem size, and superoxide (O2-) accumulation were reduced, and the distribution of the meristem master regulator PLETHORA2 (PLT2) became restricted. Transcriptome analysis revealed a strong downregulation of RGFs, RGFRs, and PLT2, rather than activation of heat shock-inducible genes. These gene mutants were more sensitive to non-lethal thermal stress. In contrast, RGF treatment recovered heat-stress-induced defects. Beyond alleviating the stress in the primary root meristem, RGF treatments promoted lateral root elongation under prolonged non-lethal thermal stress, resulting in a more complex root system. These results indicate that the RGF-RGF receptor-PLT2 pathway plays a central role in root adaptation to non-lethal heat stress rather than the canonical heat shock response pathway and suggest that manipulating RGF signaling could enhance root thermotolerance and crop resilience under elevated temperatures.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Live imaging revealed that SOK polarisation does not follow a uniform global field but instead responds to local differences in growth and mechanical state between neighbouring tissues. SOKs accumulate at interfaces separating domains of distinct growth behaviour and dissipate under compressive stress. After perturbing tissue interfaces or the mechanical continuity of the tissue, the coherence of the polarity was disrupted, indicating that stable axis establishment requires mechanical coupling across the cell wall network.

Recent technological advances enable detailed time-resolved measurements of such responses. However, a unifying model for the quantitative characterisation of dynamic response curves is lacking, thus limiting biological insights and comparisons. We developed an unbiased mathematical modelling approach that allows for the quantitative characterisation of biological response curves without a priori knowledge of underlying biochemical mechanisms. Using stress-induced plant volatile emissions, we show that the model performs well across a wide range of datasets, including incomplete induction curves, curves with low sampling resolution and complex multi-modal responses that result from overlapping stimuli. Using the model, we uncover a range of previously unrecognised patterns in volatile induction curves, including i) a strong light-independent impact of the time of day of wounding on the onset, duration and shape of the volatile induction responses, ii) an accentuation of volatile-specific induction curve shapes by herbivory-associated molecular patterns (HAMPs) and iii) independent regulation of the strength and duration of volatile induction across genotypes. We conclude that our model allows for the quantitative analysis of dynamic response curves and can identify new biological response patterns.

N-linked glycosylation and subsequent glycan remodeling barcodes glycoproteins during their maturation in the ER. Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules, key for adaptive immunity, rely on a dedicated quality control cycle that involves specialized chaperones and glycan-modifying enzymes for their maturation and loading of immunogenic peptides. However, the functional interplay of the MHC I editors tapasin as part of the peptide-loading complex (PLC), TAP-binding protein-related (TAPBPR), the UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGGT1), and calreticulin in glycan-dependent transfer of MHC I clients has not been determined in a reconstituted system. With isolated components, we show that transfer of peptide-receptive MHC I from the downstream quality control factor TAPBPR back to tapasin depends on the recognition of the monoglucosylated glycan of MHC I by calreticulin. While calreticulin's C-terminal acidic helix is dispensable for disengaging reglucosylated MHC I from TAPBPR, it is essential for docking MHC I onto tapasin. Our data provide a mechanistic basis for glycan-surveillance by calreticulin necessary for retrograde trafficking of misfolded or suboptimally loaded MHC I that escaped the first quality control at the PLC and were trapped by TAPBPR.

Replicative endothelial senescence (RES), characterized by permanent cell cycle arrest and a senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP), is a hallmark of vascular aging. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying RES, particularly the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs), remain poorly understood. To this aim, an integrated multiomics approach (proteomics, mRNA, and miRNA profiling) was applied to characterize senescent and early-passage human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and their secreted EVs. Senescent HUVECs and EVs displayed a canonical senescence profile, including cell cycle arrest, DDR activation, NF kappaB signaling, and SASP induction, alongside marked suppression of RNA metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, and DNA repair. Multiomics integration has linked endothelial senescence to vascular aging, maladaptive angiogenesis, and ECM remodeling, which are key processes in CVD development. Moreover, senescent EVs propagate senescence by exporting fewer reparative and antioxidant factors while carrying pro-fibrotic, adipogenic, and angiogenic mediators. Multiomics profiling revealed consistent transcript-protein changes in senescent cells and EVs, defining a robust molecular signature of RES, including endothelial cell-specific markers and post-transcriptional regulators (lncRNAs and miRNAs). Among these, miR22 3p and miR126 5p emerged as key modulators in both cells and EVs, with miR22 3p demonstrating compartment-specific regulation. Integration further uncovered a coordinated regulatory network involving miRNAs (miR23, miR335 3p, miR29 family, miR590 3p, and miR126 5p) that were inversely correlated with transcription factors (e.g., REST, KLFs, and ZNFs) and downstream targets, collectively driving endothelial senescence through impaired PI3K/Akt signaling.

Aberrant AS, often driven by splicing factors like SRPK1, is a mechanism cancer cells exploit to overcome chemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity. With that, this study tested the hypothesis of tumour-specific alterations in SRPK1 expression as novel therapeutic targets through a pan-cancer analysis of SRPK1 using multi-omics data, obtained from public databases, including TCGA, CPTAC, GEPIA2, and drug sensitivity platforms. The analysis specifically assessed the pan-cancer expression landscape of SRPK1 at the mRNA and protein levels and its prognostic implications across different cancer types (breast, colon, and prostate cancers), functional analysis of SRPK1-associated splicing network, and its expression in correlation with predicted drug sensitivity. The results revealed the correlations of high SRPK1 expression with worse overall and disease-free survival in a cancer-specific manner and resistance to standard-of-care agents like cisplatin and docetaxel.

To afford chemical control over Ub signalling, we construct a synthetic substrate of PRT1 with an N-terminal calmodulin-binding peptide (CBP).

We observed a slow wave in the relaxation of flash-induced Chl fluorescence kinetics under microaerobic conditions in both isolated Fugacium kawagutii (CS156) cells and intact corals, reflecting redox dynamics of the primary quinone electron acceptor (QA) in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. The addition of the extracellular electron acceptor ferricyanide decreased the wave amplitude and QA reduction while being reduced to ferrocyanide, demonstrating EET from the symbiont to extracellular acceptors. Slower Chl fluorescence rise kinetics under continuous illumination in intact corals compared to isolated symbionts indicate that electrons may also flow from symbionts to the host. Under low oxygen conditions, QA was gradually reduced in corals in darkness but not in isolated symbiont cultures, suggesting electron transfer from host to symbiont. Together, these results indicate bidirectional extracellular electron exchange between symbiotic partners, pointing to a previously unrecognized mechanism for redox balancing in coral-algal symbiosis.

Here, we reveal an unexpected and paradoxical role of the pro-oncogenic H3K9 lysine methyltransferase (KMT) SETDB1, frequently overexpressed in many cancers, in LAD regulation. Rather than reinforcing heterochromatin, SETDB1 overexpression prevents SUV39H1-driven H3K9me3 accumulation at LADs, thereby disrupting the peripheral heterochromatin. Reducing SETDB1 levels, or disrupting its interaction with SUV39H1, enables SUV39H1 to restore LAD-localized H3K9me3 and re-establish an epithelial-like heterochromatin architecture. Heterochromatin reorganization upon SETDB1 reduction stiffens the nucleus and increases cell viscosity, thereby reducing cancer cell deformability and migratory capacity. Strikingly, these mechanical effects occur without major transcriptional changes, demonstrating that chromatin architecture itself critically shapes nuclear mechanics and cell motility.

Investigating this in vivo , we find that an Ercc6l2-deficient haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment in mice is unexpectedly resilient. Ercc6l2 loss was also tolerated in mice co-deficient for endogenous formaldehyde detoxification, which precipitates early-onset BMF in models of Fanconi anaemia. Instead, Ercc6l2-deficient mice display a mild immunodeficiency, arising from defects in immunoglobulin class-switch recombination (CSR) that synergise with shieldin-deficiency, implicating ERCC6L2 and shieldin in distinct repair mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ERRC6L2 stimulates chromosome fusions in the context of staggered, but not blunt dysfunctional telomeres. We reconcile ERCC6L2's NHEJ function through proteomic elucidation of its endogenous interactome and AlphaFold structural modelling to reveal a complex formed of ERCC6L2 and KU that is bridged by the NHEJ accessory factor MRI/CYREN.

Accordingly, examples of direct contact between cell-type specific TFs and RNA synthesis enzymes in mammalian cells remain elusive. Here we show that NANOG directly contacts RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) via aromatic residues within the low complexity domains of both proteins. NANOG can localize RNAPII to a specific DNA site, with RNAPII enhancing NANOG DNA affinity. The NANOG-RNAPII complex is dissociated by the transcriptional pause-release enzyme, CDK9. Inhibition of CDK9 enhances NANOG chromatin binding, while induction of NANOG localizes RNAPII to specific NANOG chromatin sites. Induced RNAPII localization is selective for targets activated by NANOG. A NANOG mutant that retains DNA, but not RNAPII binding, cannot stimulate RNAPII localization to chromatin, shows an impaired transcriptional response and does not drive LIF-independent ESC self-renewal.

Methods: Nanoparticles were synthesized via co-precipitation method and characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). N. sativa extract was prepared through maceration in 70% methanol. Antimicrobial activity was assessed using agar well diffusion assay and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination. Results: Nanoparticles demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against E. coli (inhibition zones: 2.5-2.7 cm) but showed no activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Conversely, N. sativa extract exhibited antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa (inhibition zones: 2.0-2.2 cm) but not against E. coli.

Conclusion: The study revealed complementary but non-synergistic antimicrobial activities between N. sativa extract and metal oxide nanoparticles. Future research should investigate the molecular mechanisms preventing synergy and explore potential antagonistic interactions.

However, recent surveys indicate that non-tailed phages might be more abundant than tailed phages, and with different effects on microbial mortality and gene transfer. Here, we report the structural characterization of bacteriophage NO16, a non-tailed vibriophage, one of the simplest members of the Double Jelly Roll (DJR) lineage. Mass spectrometry analyses indicate that the virion is composed of at least nine different proteins. NO16 has a pseudoT = 21 capsid, similar to other phages in the lineage but differs in the organization of minor capsid proteins, mainly in terms of membrane-capsid contacts. The DJR major capsid protein GP19 is stabilized by a cation in the base as previously observed in corticovirus PM2, and by strong electrostatic interactions between monomers. Notably, localized reconstruction reveals a symmetry mismatch at the vertex, where two trimeric GP13 spikes are anchored to a pentamer of the penton base GP14. GP13 presents carbohydrate-binding modules and putative glycosylase activity, indicating implications for host entry. Finally, we use structural and functional predictions for NO16 non-structural proteins to propose a complete atlas of the NO16 infectious cycle.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Sa3int phages, in particular, contribute highly human-specific virulence factors that promote immune evasion and survival within the host. The reversible excision of these phages which occurs without phage production and bacterial lysis allows the simultaneous expression of phage virulence genes and the hlb gene where they usually integrate. However, the regulatory mechanisms controlling phage assembly and the cross-talk with host factors remain poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the regulatory mechanism controlling late gene transcription in Sa3int phage {Phi}13. We identified a functional promoter, P23, located upstream of the late phage genes that control DNA processing and packaging, capsid assembly, bacterial lysis and immune evasion. SAOUHSC_02200, the gene located upstream of P23, encodes for a late transcriptional regulator (Ltr). Mutating the P23 TATA-box or the ltr gene abolished P23 activity and formation of mature intact phage particles, thus confirming the role of Ltr in regulating P23 activity. Four direct repeats upstream of the P23 transcriptional start site were identified as potential Ltr binding sites. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed that Ltr-dependent P23 activation is essential for expression of late genes and the subsequent propagation of {Phi}13. Furthermore, comparative analysis of P23 activity and ltr expression in different host strain backgrounds revealed strain-specific differences that appear to depend on the alternative sigma factor SigB and its downstream effector SpoVG. These findings establish Ltr as the major regulator of late gene expression in {Phi}13 and reveal bacterial host factors that control successful phage assembly, and bacterial lysis.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

While bacterial development of resistance during therapy is observed relatively frequently, it is paradoxically thought to often be mediated by rare mutations (estimated frequency of ~1 in 10^6 or less) and is generally viewed as an unpreventable event. Here, we describe the initial classification of an isolate of Klebsiella pneumoniae as susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) by standard broth microdilution (BMD) testing, yet the classification of a subsequent follow-up isolate after patient treatment as resistant, seemingly demonstrating de novo evolution of TZP resistance. However, we reveal that both isolates actually exhibit heteroresistance, a phenomenon in which an isolate harbors a minor subpopulation of resistant cells, co-existing with a majority susceptible population. We demonstrate that an increase in the frequency of the resistant subpopulation in the follow-up isolate, mediated by an increase in copy number of the SHV-1 beta-lactamase, led to this isolate being classified resistant. These data highlight how a relatively minor change in the frequency of the resistant subpopulation in a heteroresistant isolate, rather than the de novo evolution of classical resistance in which all cells exhibit resistance, can underlie the classification of resistance by diagnostic tests. This emphasizes the need for more sensitive diagnostics which can detect heteroresistance, and potentially help explain why results indicating resistance are often observed rapidly after the introduction of novel antibiotics into clinical practice.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Despite their intriguing nucleosome-binding activity, the potential functions of the HMGN proteins in chromatin have not yet been assessed unambiguously due to the presence of several related HMGN genes in vertebrates and the lack of HMGN null cells. Here, we investigated the genome-wide activities of the human HMGN proteins by generating and analyzing an HMGN null cell line and isogenic HMGN rescue cell lines. These experiments revealed that the HMGN proteins function in the activation of gene expression at the level of transcription initiation at over a thousand specific sites that are mostly in promoters and enhancers. We additionally observed shared as well as unique functions of HMGN1 and HMGN2, which are likely to be the most abundant and ancient HMGN proteins. These findings thus indicate that the HMGN nucleosome-binding proteins are vertebrate-specific regulatory factors that primarily function in the activation of transcription initiation.

If left unrepaired, DNA damage can lead to replication errors resulting in changes in DNA sequences that could impact peptide sequences and gene expression, as well as lead to chromosomal breaks. Highlighting the importance of DNA polymerase repair function, variant DNA polymerases and cofactors of DNA repair pathways have been identified in many different cancer types. Recently, variant forms of DNA polymerase Q (POLQ) have been identified in patient isolated melanoma tumors. Previous work identifying biochemical characteristics of these variants has shown that they display aberrant DNA polymerase activity compared to wild-type (WT). To better understand the role these variants have in DNA repair, genomic stability and cell survival, we tested their ability to bypass and extend DNA past cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) as well as prevent cell death when exposed to ultra-violet (UV) radiation. Biochemically we show that the patient derived variants of POLQ tested here display decreased efficiency during DNA bypass and extension of CPD lesions and prefer to incorporate purines. In addition, two of the three variants protect against UV induced cell death. Together these data suggest that POLQ variants can support cell survival and further supports that POLQ variants can act as both protectors of cell viability as well as drivers of genomic instability, characteristics important in cancer cells.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we have changed the chromophore chemistry by converting the thioether group of M66 to a thiol group through mutation to cysteine. The new variant termed mCoral due to its orange fluorescence hue has similar brightness to mCherry but has improved resistance to hydrogen peroxide. The variant is also responsive to pH with a low and high pKa forms that have distinct spectral properties, which DFT analysis suggests is due to protonation state changes in the newly introduced thiol group as well as the phenol group. The structure of mCoral reveals that the M66C mutation creates a space within the beta-barrel structure that is filled by a water molecule, which makes new polar interactions including with backbone carbonyl group of F65. Molecular dynamic simulations suggests that this additional water molecule, together with local solvation around the chromophore, could play a role in promoting planarity of the full conjugated system comprising the chromophore; the mCoral chromophore makes slightly more H-bonds with water than mCherry. The main water exit point for mCherry is also narrower in mCoral potentially explaining the increased resistance to hydrogen peroxide. Overall, a small structural change to mCherry has resulted in a new fluorescent protein with potentially useful characteristics and an insight into the role of dynamics and water in defining structure-function relationship in red fluorescent proteins.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

This approach reveals that substrate transport is driven by a conformational switch from the inward- to the outward-facing state. Using a slow-turnover TmrAB variant, we demonstrate that ATP binding alone, even in the absence of Mg2+, is sufficient to drive a single round of peptide translocation. Cryo-EM structures of wild-type and slow-turnover TmrAB show that ATP binding induces the outward-facing conformation even without Mg2+. In wild-type TmrAB, this conformational transition supports a single translocation event, whereas Mg2+-dependent ATP hydrolysis is required to reset the transporter.

Staphylococcus aureus, a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections, relies on a multiple-layered regulatory network, including post-transcriptional mechanisms, to transition between planktonic and biofilm lifestyles. Here, we expand the cross-lineage sRNA repertoire of S. aureus by integrating newly generated RNA-seq data from the Brazilian ST239 Bmb9393 strain with public datasets from five USA-lineage strains previously uncharacterized for sRNAs. Using sequence homology and covariance models, we predicted and annotated candidate sRNA loci across all analyzed genomes, quantified their expression under planktonic and biofilm conditions, and assigned genomic context. Integration of differential-expression (DE) profiles with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified sRNAs associated with biofilm and virulence, in modules that include well-known regulators (sarA, mgrA, RNAIII) and the adhesin clfA. To prioritize functional target interactions, we combined DEG concordance, network features, and interaction-energy thresholds, depleting millions of initial predictions to thousands of high-confidence sRNA-mRNA pairs.

By recruiting the transcriptional machinery to gene enhancers or promoters, TFs can either activate or repress transcription, thereby controlling gene activity and various biological pathways. Accurate identification of TFs is vital for elucidating gene regulatory mechanisms within cells. However, experimental identification remains labor-intensive and time-consuming, highlighting the necessity for efficient computational approaches. In this study, we present a two-layer predictive framework utilizing protein language models (pLMs) via full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The initial layer robustly classifies and identifies transcription factors, while the subsequent layer predicts TFs with a binding preference for methylated DNA (TFPMs). Our approach further incorporates attention weights and protein sequence motifs to enhance interpretability and predictive capability. By leveraging attention mechanisms, we highlight biologically relevant regions of the protein sequences that contribute most strongly to the predictions. Additionally, motif analysis facilitates the identification of conserved sequence patterns that are critical for TF recognition and function.

Individual sinoatrial node cells (SANCs) generate spontaneous rhythmic action potentials (APs) that initiate each heartbeat. The mechanism of SANC automaticity and its modulation by autonomous nervous system are based on the coupled function of molecules of both the cell membrane (ion channels, exchangers, and pumps) and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which generates rhythmic local Ca releases (LCRs). While LCRs are generated by ryanodine receptors (RyRs), the molecular-scale structure of the RyR network remains unknown. Here we performed single-molecule localization via direct Stochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM) to examine the peripheral distribution of RyRs in rabbit SANCs in basal conditions and 5 minutes after {beta}-adrenergic receptor ({beta}AR) stimulation by isoproterenol. We found that RyRs form clusters of various sizes, with the mean density of 67.7 {+/-}13.2 RyR/m2. (Mean {+/-}SEM, 6 cells). While the majority of cluster sizes ranged from 3 to 32 RyRs, each cell had a few substantially larger clusters (>76 RyRs), dubbed superclusters. {beta}AR stimulation significantly increased the RyR density to 119.1 {+/-}22.6 RyR/m2 (8 cells, p<0.05) and created more superclusters. Our new numerical SANC model showed that superclustering substantially decreased the AP cycle length (APCL) by creating Ca release hotspots (nucleation sites) that initiated larger LCRs and accelerated diastolic depolarization in any condition. Increasing RyR density prolonged APCL in the basal state but shortened APCL during {beta}AR stimulation. With no change in RyR network, {beta}AR stimulation of only SR Ca pump (Pup) and ion currents (ICaL, If, and IKr) shortened APCL from 382.7 to 288.2 ms. When realistic higher RyR density and superclustering were added to the model, APCL further shortened to 242.6 ms. Thus, dynamic changes in RyR network provide a new powerful regulatory mechanism for cardiac pacemaker function. The strongest fight-or-flight response is achieved when all mechanisms synergistically work together, i.e. augmentations in RyR density and superclustering are combined with respective increases in SR Ca pumping and membrane ion currents.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

We investigated whether activation of G protein-coupled receptor 37 (GPR37) at the spinal level can erase this memory and resolve long-lasting, enhanced pain using two animal models: the capsaicin model and the hyperalgesic priming model. Without altering normal mechanical and heat nociception, a single intrathecal (i.th.) administration of two GPR37 agonists, TX14A and protectin D1 (PD1), dose-dependently inhibited capsaicin-induced increase in nociception not only acutely but also long-term. In the hyperalgesic priming model, a single i.th. injection of either GPR37 agonist, given after an initial injury-induced priming, dose-dependently prevented increased nociception following a subsequent inflammatory insult, indicating an unpriming effect. Global GPR37 knockout abolished the long-term inhibitory effect and unpriming effect of i.th. TX14A, confirming the receptor at the spinal level as the molecule mediating the effects. Ex vivo Ca2+ imaging revealed that i.th. TX14A, given in vivo to the capsaicin model a week before imaging, had rescued dorsal horn excitatory and inhibitory interneurons from long-term potentiation and depression of responsiveness to afferent inputs, respectively, suggesting the erasure of capsaicin-induced spinal pain memory.

In guppies, sperm velocity is a validated predictor of male reproductive performance, making them a powerful system for exploring microbiome-fertility interactions.

Here, we combined transcriptomics, lipidomics, imaging mass spectrometry, and stable-isotope tracing to investigate organic nutrient exchange in this symbiotic system. Our results reveal that endosymbiotic algae undergo extensive reprogramming of lipid metabolic pathways and accumulate markedly higher levels of triglycerides than free-living algae. Isotope-labeling experiments demonstrate that at least some of these lipids originate from the host, providing direct evidence for organic carbon transfer from Paramecium to its algal endosymbionts. Together, our results show that the establishment of symbiosis fundamentally reshapes algal lipid metabolism and uncover an unexpected host-to-symbiont lipid provisioning mechanism-opposite to the canonical direction of carbon flow observed in most photosynthetic symbioses. This work provides new insight into the metabolic principles that sustain and stabilize endosymbiotic partnerships.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

However, systematic discovery of genes governing these sensory processes has been limited by the transient nature of signaling events and the low throughput of measurement assays. Here, we present CaRPOOL, a pooled, high-throughput genetic screening platform that integrates the calcium-activity recorder CaMPARI2 with CRISPR interference(CRISPRi), enabling stable capture of transient calcium signals for genome-scale functional screening. Using osmomechanical stimulation as a model, we demonstrate that CaMPARI2 photoconversion faithfully reports stimulus-dependent calcium responses and supports pooled fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based screening. A CRISPRi library targeting membrane-associated genes identified both known and previously uncharacterized regulators of mechanotransduction, including the chemokine receptorCCR7. Mechanistic analyses revealed thatCCR7 promotes osmomechanical calcium signaling through a PIEZO1-dependent Gs-cAMP-PKA pathway, establishing it as a mechanosensitive GPCR. Notably, osmotic stress upregulatedCCR7 expression in immune cells and enhanced mechanical responsiveness, suggesting a role in immunomechanical adaptation. Together, these findings introduce a broadly applicable platform for high-throughput discovery of genes controlling dynamic signaling responses and reveals a GPCR-ion channel crosstalk mechanism in mechanotransduction with potential implications for immune cell mechanoadaptation.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

V.; Utaegbulam, J. N.; Brown, H. E.; Ramirez, B.; Velcani, M.; Ryder, S. P.", "abstract": "During fertilization, haploid gametes combine to form a zygote. The male (sperm) and female (oocyte) gametes contribute a similar amount of DNA, but the oocyte contributes nearly all the cytoplasm. Oocytes are loaded with maternal mRNAs thought to be essential for embryonic patterning after fertilization. A conserved suite of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulates the spatiotemporal translation and stability of maternal mRNAs. POS-1 is a CCCH-type tandem zinc finger RBP expressed in fertilized Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes from maternally supplied mRNA. POS-1 accumulates in the posterior of the embryo where it promotes posterior cell fate. Here, we show that the pos-1 3' untranslated region (UTR) is essential for POS-1 patterning and contributes to maximal reproductive fecundity. We engineered a pos-1 mutant where most of the endogenous pos-1 3'UTR was removed using CRISPR genome editing. Our results show that the 3'UTR represses POS-1 expression in the maternal germline but increases POS-1 protein levels in embryos after fertilization. In a wild-type background, POS-1 repression via the 3'UTR has little impact on fertility. In a sensitized background, the deletion mutant has a complex pleiotropic phenotype where most adult homozygous progeny lack either one or both gonad arms. Most phenotypes become more penetrant at elevated temperature. Together, our results support an emerging model where the 3'UTRs of maternal transcripts, rather than being essential, contribute to reproductive robustness during stress.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Functionally, these iVSMCs could respond to the vasoconstrictor carbachol. Coupling this protocol with an automated Hamilton liquid-handling robotics system allowed the generation of iVSMCs in large quantities, morphologically similar to manually differentiated iVSMCs.

There is growing interest in connecting machine learning with genomic breeding value prediction. Although the BLUP formula is itself mathematically differentiable, existing implementations do not expose a differentiable computational graph and cannot be trained end-to-end. Here, we present [D]-BLUP, a differentiable implementation of the genomic mixed model in JAX that makes the BLUP solve part of the training process rather than an external step. The variance ratio {lambda} and optional block-level kernel weights are treated as trainable parameters, allowing these components to be learned directly from prediction error while preserving the BLUP structure used in animal and plant breeding. This means BLUP can now fit naturally within gradient-based models common in machine learning without losing its interpretability. The method solves the familiar BLUP with either an unweighted VanRaden genomic relationship matrix or a block-weighted variant, via automatic differentiation, allowing simultaneous training. On a public dataset, [D]-BLUP with a fixed VanRaden kernel reproduces rrBLUP estimated breeding values and predictive performance, while learning {lambda}, and optionally SNP block weights, from a mean squared error objective.

MicroRNA 92a (miR-92a) is a known factor in diabetic wounds that perpetuates non-healing wound phenotypes by inhibiting angiogenesis. Therefore, its local inhibition at wound sites has therapeutic potential. To achieve this, we combine a nanoparticle formulation of polyelectrolyte complex micelles (PCMs) delivering miR-92a inhibitors with a hyaluronic acid (HA) gel formulation suitable for topical application to wound sites. The nanoparticles, formed by polyelectrolyte complexation of poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(L-lysine) with RNA cargo, are functionalized with targeting peptides against vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) to improve affinity for inflamed endothelial cells. We demonstrate effective PCM encapsulation and controlled release from gel formulations in vitro and in vivo. These PCMs are taken up in vivo by endothelial cells and exert functional transcriptional effects on miR-92a and its downstream targets. Furthermore, our composite PCM-gel formulation significantly accelerates wound closure in diabetic mouse models and improves angiogenesis, consistent with the known role of miR-92a inhibition in vascular regeneration.

This makes them one of the most promising biocatalysts for chemical synthesis.

Although more than 4,000 putative UPO enzymes have been recorded in databases, only about 50 of them can currently be heterologously expressed. All UPOs discovered so far originate from eukaryotes (mainly basidiomycetes and some ascomycetes), and they rely on the complex expression systems and post-translational modifications of their native hosts. This further exacerbates the challenges associated with heterologous expression of eukaryotic UPOs. In this work, we developed a deep-learning-based enzyme mining strategy and, for the first time, discovered novel UPO enzymes from bacteria, achieving successful heterologous expression in Escherichia coli. Bacterial UPOs differ greatly from fungal UPOs in sequence similarity, displaying completely distinct evolutionary trajectories. The discovery of bacterial UPOs advances our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms and expression characteristics within the UPO family, breaking the long-held assumption that UPOs can only originate from eukaryotes. Their excellent heterologous expression performance and broad catalytic versatility will further expand the application potential of UPOs.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Yet how their unusual diversity of visual opsins (Porter et al., 2020) maps onto functional spectral sensitivities (Streets et al., 2022; T. W. Cronin et al., 2022) has remained unresolved. Here, we uncover the molecular rhodopsin-based physiological mechanisms of spectral tuning and show that seventeen opsins, mostly from the colour-sensing midband of the Neogonodactylus oerstedii eye, exhibit distinct spectral absorption ranges and couple to Gq- or Gi-proteins. Two mid-wavelength opsins (NOMs) preferentially absorb blue light, while twelve long-wavelength opsins (NOLs) absorb in the green range. In addition, three NOLs are red-sensitive beyond 600 nm, representing the most far-red-sensitive opsins functionally characterized in animals. Several opsins exhibit photoreversibility with inverse blue-red spectral shifts, revealing an unrecognised layer of photochemical flexibility in stomatopod photoreception. Combined with ommatidial carotenoid filters, our mechanistic model shows how individually tuned rhodopsins shape row-specific spectral sensitivity across the eye, promoting far-red sensitivity in tier 3P in relation to other spectral wavelengths. These specialised rhodopsin-filter combinations collectively enable robust colour vision along a broad light spectrum and across dim and bright conditions, offering new insights into the evolution of one of Natures most sophisticated visual systems.", "date": "2025-11-28", "journal": ""}

Comparative study of the electron density maps of the capsids reveals the presence of protein appendages DarA and Hdf below the 5-fold symmetric region inside capsid_L that anchor the phage dsDNA to the capsid-shell. Such densities are also noticed in large capsids depleted off their dsDNA but not observed in capsid_S. Deficiency of these appendages in capsid_S results in a smaller sized dsDNA packed inside a reduced sized phage head. Despite missing out on nearly 60% of the phage dsDNA virions with capsid_S has all the essential genes responsible for the formation of a fully mature thermodynamically stable virion particle with structurally identical tail and baseplate as of capsid_L.

Here, we demonstrate that non-excitable cells maintain stable, spatially heterogeneous membrane voltage gradients. Using the ratiometric voltage indicator JEDI-2P-cyOFP1, we quantitatively map membrane potential in live cells and find that cellular protrusions are consistently depolarized, whereas lateral membrane regions are hyperpolarized. These voltage gradients strongly correlate with anisotropic distributions of anionic lipids, including phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Perturbation of cytoskeletal integrity, the ion exchanger NHE1, or vesicular trafficking disrupts both voltage anisotropy and lipid polarization, revealing an uncharacterized electromechanical regulatory mechanism. Moreover, membrane potential dynamically responds to cell shape, substrate stiffness, external electric fields, and cell cycle progression. To account for these phenomena, we develop a quantitative model that integrates ionic fluxes and lipid charge distributions, thereby explaining the emergence of voltage gradients. This framework establishes that membrane potential is governed not solely by ionic currents but also by lipid dynamics and mechanical signaling.

Foliar spray of a SynCom consisting of three citrus endophytic bacterial strains (Paenibacillus sp.

The enriched Brevibacillus and Pseudomonas spp. were isolated, whole-genome sequenced, and confirmed to possess multiple beneficial traits including antimicrobial activity against Xcc, Moreover, the expression of citrus defense genes was induced by the SynCom1 inoculation. Foliar application of SynCom1 and a newly assembled SynCom (SynCom2; SynCom1 with representative Brevibacillus and Pseudomonas isolates) prior to Xcc inoculation significantly reduced the citrus canker disease severity in greenhouse assays, and SynCom2 had a better efficacy, comparable to a copper bactericide.

However, the developmental timeline for the emergence of these two types of hippocampal representations remains unknown. Using longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed mice during the third postnatal week, we investigated when internal versus external hippocampal representations emerge. We recorded from deep and superficial CA1 layers while mice ran on treadmills that are bare or enriched with tactile cues, addressing the challenge of tracking cells across sessions. Internal sequences emerge during the mid-fourth postnatal week, following the development of cue-based representations. These sequences initially encode elapsed time before evolving to integrate run distance, arising after rest cell assemblies as spatial coding and functional connectivity networks stabilize. These findings identify the mid fourth postnatal week as a critical developmental milestone marking the establishment of a balanced integration between external landmark-based and internal self-referenced spatial representations.
