Given a generic model, several methods have been developed to extract a context-specific, genome-scale metabolic model by incorporating information used to identify metabolic processes and gene activities in a given context. However, existing model extraction algorithms are unable to ensure that the context-specific model is thermodynamically feasible. This protocol introduces XomicsToModel, a semi-automated pipeline that integrates bibliomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data with a generic genome-scale metabolic reconstruction, or model, to extract a context-specific, genome-scale metabolic model that is stoichiometrically, thermodynamically and flux consistent. The XomicsToModel pipeline is exemplified for extraction of a specific metabolic model from a generic metabolic model, but it enables omics data integration and extraction of physicochemically consistent mechanistic models from any generic biochemical network. With all input data fully prepared, algorithmic completion of the pipeline takes approx 10 min, however manual review of intermediate results may also be required, e.g., when inconsistent input data lead to an infeasible model.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "During eukaryotic cell division, microtubules connect to chromosomes by attaching to the kinetochore via the NDC80 complex (NDC80c). Improperly attached kinetochore microtubules (KMTs) are selective detached from the kinetochore. While the proper regulation of KMT detachments is crucial for accurate chromosome segregation, the manner by which KMT detachments are controlled by the biophysical properties of NDC80 and KMTs remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mechanism of KMT detachment by combining quantitative measurements of NCD80c-KMT binding and KMT detachments, with FLIM-FRET and photoconversion, and mathematical modeling. We find that individual NDC80c at kinetochores bind noncooperatively to KMTs, with a free energy difference between bound and unbound NDC80c of -1.0kT, and we determine that each phosphorylated residue of NDC80c decreases the NDC80c-KMT binding energy by 0.35kBT. We show that the energetics of NDC80c binding can be related to KMT detachment by a dual detachment mechanism in which KMTs detach from kinetochores when either 1) all NDC80c spontaneously unbind from the KMT or 2) following KMT catastrophe. We find that the affinity of NDC80c for KMTs is reduced at low-tension, non-bioriented kinetochores due to centromere-localized Aurora B phosphorylating the NDC80c, resulting in an elevated detachment rate for the associated KMTs. Taken together, this work leads to a multiscale, bottom-up biophysical model for how the energetics of NDC80c-KMT interactions impact KMT detachments and provides an understanding of the molecular basis of their regulation during mitotic error correction.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Characterizing the neural dynamics that underlie these complementary memory operations requires identifying the exact moments when each operation occurs. We address this challenge by interrogating fMRI brain activation with a computational learning model that predicts trial-by-trial when memories are created versus updated. We found distinct neural engagement in anterior hippocampus and ventral striatum for model-predicted memory create and update events during early learning. Notably, the degree of this effect in hippocampus, but not ventral striatum, significantly related to learning outcome. Hippocampus additionally showed distinct patterns of functional coactivation with ventromedial prefrontal cortex and angular gyrus during memory creation and premotor cortex during memory updating. These findings suggest that complementary memory functions, as formalized in computational learning models, underlie the rapid formation of novel conceptual knowledge, with the hippocampus and its interactions with frontoparietal circuits playing a crucial role in successful learning.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Deletion of RRBP1 in HEK293T cells led to a reduction in both peroxisome number and peroxisomal protein levels as well as in defects in processing of peroxisomal matrix proteins, such as ACOX1 and thiolase. However, cell proliferation and protein translation were not altered in cells lacking RRBP1. RRBP1 depletion did not affect peroxisome-ER contact sites, and pexophagy did not contribute to the reduction of peroxisomes in RRBP1 KO cells. Instead, in the absence of RRBP1, peroxisomal proteins were processed by proteasomal degradation, suggesting that RRBP1 plays a role in the insertion of these proteins into ER membranes and their stabilization.

The lack of paired sequencing experiments limits the analysis of microRNA-gene regulatory networks. We explore whether protein-coding gene expression can be quantified directly from transcript fragments present in sRNA-seq experiments. We analyze studies containing matched total RNA and small RNA from four human tissues and recover transcript fragments from the sRNA-seq datasets. We find that the expression levels of protein-coding gene transcripts derived from sRNA-seq datasets are comparable to those from total RNA-seq experiments (R2 ranging from 0.33 to 0.76). Analyses across multiple tissues and species show similar correlations, indicating that the approach is applicable across organisms. We confirm that transcript half-life and the expression of housekeeping or highly abundant genes do not bias the results. Analysis of the expression of both microRNAs and coding genes from the same sRNA-seq experiments demonstrate that known microRNA-target interactions are, as expected, inversely correlated with the expression profiles of these microRNA-mRNA pairs. For a dual mRNA/miRNA profile, we recommend sequencing the [&ge;]25 nucleotide fraction at [&ge;]5 M reads.

Splicing factors and small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) are core components of splicing machinery, and splicing factors are further controlled by post-translational modifications, among which arginine methylation is one of the most prevalent. We determined the splicing mechanisms in the cranial neural crest cells (CNCCs), a multipotent developmental population that gives rise to the majority of the craniofacial skeleton, and focused on an upstream regulator of splicing proteins, protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1). PRMT1 is the highest expressing arginine methyltransferase in CNCCs and its role in craniofacial development is evident from our earlier investigation, where CNCC-specific Prmt1 deletion caused cleft palate and mandibular hypoplasia. PRMT1 catalyzes arginine methylation of splicing factors to modify protein localization, expression and activity. In the present study, we uncover roles of PRMT1 in the regulation of intron retention, a type of alternative splicing where introns are retained in the mature mRNA. CNCCs from mandibular primordium of Prmt1-deficient embryos demonstrated an increase in the percentage of intron-retaining mRNA of matrix genes, which triggered NMD, causing a reduction in matrix mRNA abundance. We further identified SFPQ as a substrate of PRMT1 that depends on PRMT1 for arginine methylation and protein expression in the developing craniofacial structures. Depletion of SFPQ in CNCCs phenocopied PRMT1 deletion whereby matrix, Wnt signaling components and neuronal gene transcripts contained higher IR and exhibited lower expression. We further recognized gene length as a common feature among SFPQ-regulated genes in CNCCs. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the PRMT1-SFPQ pathway modulates matrix gene expression via IR-triggered NMD in CNCCs during craniofacial development.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

However, this hierarchical view ignores the coevolutionary feedback from species interactions to species traits and its consequences for species coexistence. Here, we developed a theoretical model of quantitative genetics to explore how the coevolution of morphological and phenological traits shapes the structure and stability of mutualistic interaction networks. We found that, in comparison to morphological traits, phenological traits led to distinctive species evolutionary trajectories, resulting in different emergent properties at community level. This is because phenological traits promoted facilitation over competition. While morphological coevolution gave rise to modular and specialized interaction networks with a negative diversity-stability trade-off, phenological coevolution was required for the emergence of nested interaction networks that exhibited a positive relationship between diversity and structural stability. Empirical observations from 17 pollination networks were consistent with the theoretical results: we found many phenological motifs promoting facilitation over competition, suggesting an important role of phenological coevolution in community assembly. The seasonal organization of empirical interactions enhanced the community stability and dampened the diversity-stability trade-off that was observed when aggregating interactions across time.

Simultaneous recordings allow referencing neurons' activity to each other and thus detecting signals that are internal to the organism. Further, multi-region simultaneous recordings allow observing how these internal signals are coordinated across the brain. Following this logic in rats performing a perceptual decision-making task, we recorded simultaneously from thousands of neurons across up to 20 brain regions at once. Here we report two internal signals which we found to profoundly shape decision-related neural dynamics and brain states. First, we decoded the continuously evolving decision state separately from each region, and found surprisingly large magnitude co-fluctuations in these measures. Dimensionality analysis showed these to be dominated by a single state variable, suggesting that only a single decision-making computation, not multiple parallel computations, are being carried out during the analyzed period. Second, we found that the precise time the subject commits to a decision--a covert event that we decoded from large-scale neural activity in primary motor cortex--was accompanied by a coordinated change, across the brain, from a decision formation to a post-commitment state. The two states differ substantially in their choice-predictive neural dynamics and in their inter-region correlations. Therefore, knowing the time of this state change on single trials is needed to correctly parse fundamentally different phases of decision-making. Overall, our data suggest that internally-referenced signals and state changes, not timelocked to external events but detectable through simultaneous recordings, are major features of neural activity during cognition.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

The results show that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Ascomycota are the dominant phyla. Fundamental metabolic pathways are maintained during the formation of visually distinguishable microbial communities, but gene profiles vary across microbial communities of different colors. Ecological modelling suggests that selective pressure from the harsh stone surface environment fostered the interplay of dispersal limitation and heterogeneous selection during community assembly. The assembly of visually distinct microbial communities is linked to a narrower ecological niche, higher proportion of habitat specialists, and sparser network structure.

One notable missing feature in most ANN models is top-down feedback, i.e. projections from higher-order layers to lower-order layers in the network. Top-down feedback is ubiquitous in the brain, and it has a unique modulatory impact on activity in neocortical pyramidal neurons. However, we still do not understand its computational role. Here we develop a deep neural network model that captures the core functional properties of top-down feedback in the neocortex, allowing us to construct hierarchical recurrent ANN models that more closely reflect the architecture of the brain. We use this to explore the impact of different hierarchical recurrent architectures on an audiovisual integration task. We find that certain hierarchies, namely those that mimic the architecture of the human brain, impart ANN models with a light visual bias similar to that seen in humans. This bias does not impair performance on the audiovisual tasks. The results further suggest that different configurations of top-down feedback make otherwise identically connected models functionally distinct from each other, and from traditional feedforward and laterally recurrent models. Altogether our findings demonstrate that modulatory top-down feedback is a computationally relevant feature of biological brains, and that incorporating it into ANNs affects their behavior and constrains the solutions it's likely to discover.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Genetic and physiological adaptations in the MD were assessed in mice treated with the chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure model of dependence, which increased alcohol intake and preference during choice sessions for water or sucrose. Results indicated that CIE exposure induced changes in transcript expression and excitability of MD neurons. Enrichment analysis of alcohol-sensitive genes revealed dysregulation of genes that control glial function and axonal myelination. Fiber photometry was used to record MD calcium signals in CIE mice during choice drinking sessions for alcohol and either water or sucrose. Results demonstrated that MD activity was elevated at the start of and after licking bouts for alcohol, water, or sucrose, although the signal for alcohol was significantly higher than signal for other solutions and this effect persisted after induction of dependence.

Recent studies suggest that sea anemones, members of the basally-branching phylum Cnidaria, might possess an immune response with more vertebrate characteristics than previously thought; however, it is unknown whether cnidarians also employ RNAi as an antiviral response similarly to nematodes and insects. Here, we characterize the response of the model cnidarian Nematostella vectensis to simulated viral infection.

Interestingly, we detected no evidence for secondary siRNA production, despite their crucial role in the amplification of antiviral response in other organisms. Notably, siRNA pathway components are specifically upregulated upon dsRNA injection, while microRNA pathway components are downregulated. Furthermore, injection of mRNA coding for self-replicating viral gene fused to eGFP, also induced upregulation of siRNA-related genes and a mild decrease in transgene expression.

Structure Based Drug Design (SBDD) for RNA is a practical approach to achieve successful drug candidates. However, RNA-targeted SBDD faces a technical challenge, a paucity of available tertiary structures of RNA-ligand complexes. To address the problem, we present a computational strategy to generate RNA conformations harboring cryptic binding sites from apo RNA conformations, by using Molearn, a generative deep learning (DL) model designed to explore high energy states along conformational transition pathways. Focusing on the paradigmatic RNA-ligand complex, HIV-1 Transactivation Response Element (TAR) binding to MV2003, we succeed to generate TAR conformations with a cryptic binding cavity for MV2003, without a priori knowledge of the cavity. These conformations were docked to MV2003, yielding poses with binding scores comparable to those calculated for experimentally resolved TAR-MV2003 complexes. Prior atomistic molecular dynamics and DL-based RNA 3D structure prediction studies on this target have not reported recovery of the cryptic site from apo conformations. Finally, we discuss the technical advantages, acknowledge current limitations, and outline concrete avenues for improvement.

Intraspecific genetic variation is shaped by species natural history traits and by characteristics of geography and climate within their ranges. Salamanders (Order Caudata) are amphibians of ecological and conservation interest because of their global distribution, trait diversity, and roles within ecological communities. Here, we studied genetic variation within salamanders to investigate predictors of nucleotide diversity and spatial patterns of genetic differentiation. Location: Global. Time Period: Present. Major Taxa Studied: Salamanders. Methods: We repurposed mitochondrial DNA sequences, natural history traits, and geographic and environmental data from open-access databases for 214 salamander species. We calculated nucleotide diversity (pi) and tested for isolation by distance (IBD) and isolation by environment (IBE) within each species. We analyzed these three response variables with random forest analyses and phylogenetic comparative methods using 27 predictors expected to be associated with genetic variation (e.g., number of offspring, total range size). Results: We recovered 8,175 Cytb sequences with their associated geographic coordinates, of which 7,007 sequences were manually curated by us. Species range size and sample size (the number of sequences) were important predictors of genetic variation. We found higher diversity in regions including the Neotropics and central-eastern Europe. The absence of strong phylogenetic signal in pi, IBD, and IBE suggests that genetic variation is shaped by local ecological and geographical factors rather than by shared ancestry. Main Conclusions: Our finding that range size was an important predictor of genetic variation aligns with theoretical expectations that species with larger ranges tend to harbor more genetic diversity. Our results underscore the importance of integrating spatial data (i.e., DNA sequences and their associated coordinates) into macrogenetic studies, providing valuable information for future studies and conservation strategies targeting regions with high or low genetic diversity.

Here, we present a systematic comparison of 38 gene embedding methods derived from amino acid sequences, gene expression profiles, protein-protein interaction networks, and biomedical literature. We benchmark each approach across three classes of tasks: predicting individual gene attributes, characterizing paired gene interactions, and assessing gene set relationships while trying to control for data leakage. Overall, we find that literature-based embeddings deliver superior performance across prediction tasks, sequence-based models excel in genetic interaction predictions, and expression-derived representations are well-suited for disease-related associations. Interestingly, network embeddings achieve similar performance to literature-based embeddings on most tasks despite using significantly smaller training sets. The type of training data has a greater influence on performance than the specific embedding construction method, with embedding dimensionality having only minimal impact. Our benchmarks clarify the strengths and limitations of current gene embeddings, providing practical guidance for selecting representations for downstream biological applications.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

In mice, the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome provides robust protection against bacterial pathogens that infect intestinal epithelial cells, including the gastrointestinal pathogen Shigella flexneri. By contrast, humans are highly susceptible to Shigella, despite the ability of human NAIP-NLRC4 to robustly detect Shigella T3SS proteins. Why the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome protects mice but not humans against Shigella infection remains unclear. We previously found that human THP-1 cells infected with Shigella lose responsiveness to NAIP-NLRC4 stimuli, while retaining sensitivity to other inflammasome agonists. Using mT3Sf, a minimal Shigella system, to express individual secreted Shigella effector proteins, we found that the OspF effector specifically suppresses NAIP-NLRC4-dependent cell death during infection. OspF was previously characterized as a phosphothreonine lyase that inactivates p38 and ERK MAP kinases. We found that p38 was critical for rapid priming of NAIP-NLRC4 activity, particularly in cells with low NAIP-NLRC4 expression. Overall, our results provide a mechanism by which Shigella evades inflammasome activation in humans, and describe a new mechanism for rapid priming of the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

A.; Parr, C. L.; Redeker, K. R.; Robinson, E. J. H.", "abstract": "Landscape structure modulates species dispersal by presenting barriers or opportunities. Slow-dispersing edge specialists, e.g. the northern hairy wood ant (Formica lugubris), are likely to be most affected by topography and land management practices, because they require adjacent contrasting habitats, e.g. to access both food and sunlight. In managed forests, canopy gaps are often linear and anthropogenic, such as paths, firebreaks, and roads (collectively rides), and their orientation determines shade distribution. Using data spanning 10 years, we ask how ride orientation and width affect the distribution and dispersal of three F. lugubris populations in the North York Moors, UK. Ride orientation clearly affected nest abundance, with a higher nest density on rides oriented north-south (N-S) or east-west (E-W) (cardinal directions) than on those oriented NE-SW or NW-SE (intercardinal directions). Conforming to predictions based on sunlight availability, N-S oriented rides were occupied more symmetrically than E-W ones, where the north side was used predominantly. Nests were generally larger on narrower rides. Ride orientation also clearly affected dispersal: wood ants dispersed c15 m/year along rides oriented in cardinal directions, compared with only c5 m/year on rides oriented intercardinally. Our results show that ride characteristics (width, orientation), resulting directly from forestry practices, influence the distribution and dispersal of an ecosystem engineer woodland species; this may also apply to other forest-edge specialists. As wood ants can suppress defoliating pests, these findings could benefit forest management; forest planners could encourage wood ant colonisation of plantation forest by ensuring linear features contribute to north-south and east-west connectivity.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Starting with magnetic resonance images of brains of a newborn ferret, a fetal macaque, and a fetal human, we construct two-layer physical gel brain models that swell superficially in a solvent, leading to folding patterns similar to those seen in vivo. We then adopt a three-dimensional continuum model based on differential growth to simulate cortical folding in silico. Finally, we deploy a comparative morphometric analysis of the in vivo, in vitro, and in silico surface buckling patterns across species.

EvAgg provides a thorough and current summary of observed genetic variants and their associated clinical features, enabling rapid synthesis of evidence concerning gene-disease relationships. We constructed an expert-curated dataset and evaluated EvAgg's performance.

Further, EvAgg complemented the process of manual literature review by identifying substantial additional relevant information. When tested with analysts in rare disease case analysis, EvAgg reduced review time by 34% (p-value < 0.002) and increased the number of papers, variants, and cases evaluated per unit time.

Using a biologically grounded, multilayer spiking model of thalamocortical microcircuitry, incorporating conductance-based neurons and rodent somatosensory cortex connectivity, we systematically scaled W and P and identified four organising principles of population dynamics. First, stronger synapses monotonically amplified spiking across all populations. Second, increasing connection density produced a weight-dependent bidirectional outcome: adding weak synapses preserved baseline activity, whereas adding strong ones suppressed firing. Third, concurrent increases in W and P yielded sublinear effects, where population activity increased less than expected from the sum of their individual impacts. Fourth, two functional neuronal classes emerged, scaling-invariant neurons that reliably transmitted thalamic input across connectivity regimes, and variant neurons that spiked selectively under specific connectivity scales. These classes differed in their excitation-inhibition balance, shaped by the strength of recurrent inhibition. Together, our findings show that synaptic weight and connection probability work in concert to define cortical operating regimes and generate the functional diversity in neuronal responses that supports flexible computation.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Yet, the potential and limitations of ancient protein sequences to resolve evolutionary relations between species remains largely unexplored. In this study, we aim to quantify how much information about these relations can be obtained from limited ancient protein data, at the scale that is currently available or will be available in the near future. We harness sequence alignments of 12 enamel and collagen proteins that have been previously reported in fossil material that is at least 1 million years old. We utilise in silico translations of hominid DNA sequences of these proteins and highlight their differential sequence conservation, indicating some of them contain much larger amounts of information than others. We also evaluate the extent to which inferred topologies from protein data differ from inferred topologies from the more informationally-dense DNA data. We show that the former may sometimes lead to inferences of the wrong tree topology due to the informational loss that comes when working with peptide data. Additionally, we determine the number of concatenated proteins necessary to confidently reconstruct the population / species tree summarizing the relations between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, as well as those between modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans. As expected, increasing the number of proteins in a concatenation enhances resolution, but we note that trees inferred from the full set of collagen and enamel proteins do not necessarily correspond to population trees inferred from genome-wide data. We show this is especially the case in the closely related groups of our recent ancestors. We further demonstrate that while a number of proteins fall within archaic introgressed haplotypes of present day humans, ancient admixture is not the main source of the observed tree incongruence. Our study underscores the potential and limitations of utilising palaeoproteomic data in deep time phylogenetic reconstructions, indicating that these will be aided not only by increased recovery of proteins in the future, but also by more careful modeling of evolutionary relations across the genome, beyond simply building single phylogenetic trees.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

For example, people tend to remember items as occurring farther apart in time if they spanned a change in context, or 'event boundary,' compared to the same context. While these distortions could sacrifice precise timing, they might also serve to divide and organize information into distinct memories. In the current study, we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI; n = 32) with eye-tracking (n = 28) to test whether activation of the dopaminergic system, known to influence encoding and time perception, predicts time dilation between adjacent events in memory. Participants encoded item sequences while listening to tones that mostly repeated over time, forming a stable auditory context, but occasionally switched, creating an event boundary. We found that boundaries predicted greater retrospective estimates of time between item pairs. Critically, tone switches significantly activated the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a key midbrain dopaminergic region, and these responses predicted greater time dilation between item pairs that spanned those switches. Boundaries furthermore predicted a momentary increase in blinks. Activation of the VTA predicted blinking in general, consistent with the idea that blink behavior is a potential marker of dopaminergic activity. On a larger timescale, higher blink counts predicted greater time dilation in memory, but only for boundary-spanning item pairs. Together, these findings suggest that dopaminergic processes are sensitive to event structure and may drive temporal distortions that help to separate memories of distinct events.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Most GPCR drugs bind a conserved orthosteric pocket, which can result in non-specificity, toxicity and clinical failure. Precision modalities including biased signaling and allosteric modulation could lead to GPCR therapeutics with improved efficacy and safety profiles. The rational design of precision therapies is, however, limited by the lack of high-resolution functional annotation of GPCR structures. Here we present a fast and general approach to rapidly build complete, high-resolution, multi-modal functional and allosteric maps of receptors. The approach, GPCR-MAPS, quantifies direct recruitment of proteins to a receptor and deconvolves the substantial effects of mutations on receptor expression. Applying GPCR-MAPS to the {beta}2 adrenergic receptor generates >150,000 phenotypic measurements, including the full activation functions for all possible amino acid substitutions (>7,500 unique variants) in a single experiment. The multi-modal maps provide numerous mechanistic insights and reveal a modular receptor architecture, with a core activation network surrounded by residues controlling quantitative parameters and bias. The maps also identify multiple allosteric surface pockets, including pockets bound by serendipitously discovered allosteric ligands and a novel pocket with no known ligands. The application of this approach across the superfamily of GPCRs will provide comparative maps of receptor mechanisms and a functional framework for the rational design of precision GPCR therapeutics.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Lung capillaries are comprised of two distinct subsets, one with proliferative potential to facilitate growth and repair (Cap1), and the other serving a specialized role in gas exchange (Cap2). However, the molecular mechanisms directing capillary speciation, developmental plasticity, and fate transitions during development and repair are not well understood. Here, we show that Cap2 are absent in late embryonic life but rapidly appear and expand immediately after birth. We show that Cap1 progenitors first transition to a novel, intermediate cell state (CapINT), characterized by co-expression of Cap1 and Cap2 markers, and heightened proliferation. CapINT are present in both the developing mouse and human lung. Hyperoxia, an experimental model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease marked by impaired alveolarization, increases CapINT abundance and persistence and expands Cap2 EC. CapINT EC are also increased in human infants dying with active BPD. Using genetic lineage tracing, single cell transcriptomics, ATAC-sequencing and a mouse model that permits inducible deletion of VEGFR2 in CapINT and Cap2 EC, we show that postnatal abrogation of VEGFR2 markedly increases CapINT EC abundance, blocks Cap2 terminal differentiation, impairs alveolarization, and activates alveolar fibroblasts. Finally, we identify ERG as a putative VEGFR2-downstream mechanism that promotes CapINT to Cap2 differentiation. Taken together, our data show that Cap1-Cap2 differentiation is a two-step process that only requires VEGFR2 for the second step.

We report distinct GFAP breakdown products (BDPs) and post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are unique to TBI. Mapped PTMs provided fragment and patient-specific citrullination signatures known for destabilizing GFAP filaments. GFAP and its fragments from patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum were sequenced by mass spectrometry (MS), identifying two TBI-specific coproducts covering coil1 (20-26kDa) and coil2 (15-19kDa) in the rod-domain. These coproducts were imbalanced in biofluids with coil1-BDPs enriched over coil2-BDPs detected by label-free quantitative MS and independently confirmed by immunoblot densitometry in twenty-three TBI patients. Ten-day temporal trajectories showed ongoing proteolysis, progressing from large to small fragments, with prolonged elevation of 37/39kDa fragments, and delayed rise of small products. For the first time, profiles of GFAP fragments, but not of uncleaved GFAP, predicted six-month outcome (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, GOSE), highlighting proteolytic processing as prognostic biomarker signature. These new TBI-GFAP-BDPs were independently substantiated in a human culture trauma model, offering mechanistic insights and linking biomarker data to injury-induced astrocytopathy.

A new cleavage site between the two coils was identified by selective epitope loss. Coil2 cellular retention could be explained by incorporation of citrullinated coil2-BDPs into non-filamentous aggregates within pathological astrocytes after injury. Trauma-triggered proteolysis involved calpains and caspases in distinct astrocyte injury states documented using inhibitors and live-cell reporters.

Aim: To characterize ICG with excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) in the microenvironments of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), bovine serum albumin (BSA) solutions, and 3D-printed (3DP) resin, and assess excitation-dependent emission, including red-edge excitation shifts (REES) and departures from Kasha's rule of excitation-independent emission. Approach: EEMs and absorbance spectra were acquired with extracted excitation spectra, emission spectra, emission peaks, centroids, and integrated emission areas under the curve (AUCs). Concentration-dependent behavior was examined in DMSO, and albumin concentration dependence was assessed from 5-100 mg/mL. Data processing employed robust local regression to mitigate excitation scattering artifacts. Results: ICG in DMSO exhibited excitation-independent emission consistent with Kasha-Vavilov behavior. In contrast, ICG in BSA solution and 3DP resin displayed excitation-dependent emission with pronounced REES and additional non-linear departures from Kasha's rule. To our knowledge, this represents the first documentation of REES and broader anti-Kasha effects for ICG or any FGS fluorophore. Within the excitation range most relevant to ICG-FGS (~760-805 nm), emission spectra of the BSA solution and 3DP resin overlapped closely, with similar AUC-based comparisons, suggesting that ICG in 3DP resin can serve as a suitable surrogate reference for albumin-bound ICG. Conclusions: The EEM characterization shows that excitation-dependent behavior is a defining feature of ICG in biologically relevant environments, demonstrating that emission cannot be assumed to follow classical Kasha-Vavilov behavior. Reliable comparisons and imaging system design therefore require spectra acquired at defined excitation wavelengths with AUC integration within the emission detection band. Excitation-specific spectra from EEMs establish a consistent framework for inter-system comparisons and phantom standards, while the resulting datasets provide a practical reference for addressing excitation-dependent behavior in ICG sensing applications.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Through the engineering of neuron-specific cis-regulatory alleles, Cre-mediated cell-specific knockouts and degron-mediated, temporally controlled PHA-4/FoxA removal in postmitotic neurons, we found that PHA-4/FoxA is required not only to initiate the terminal differentiation program of foregut-associated enteric neurons, but also to maintain their functional properties throughout the life of the animal. Moreover, we discovered novel sites of expression of PHA-4/FoxA in extrapharyngeal enteric neurons that innervate the hindgut (AVL and DVB), a GABAergic interneuron that controls foregut function during sleep (RIS), and a peptidergic neuron, PVT, which we implicate here in controlling defecation behavior. We show that while PHA-4/FoxA is not required for the developmental specification of AVL, DVB, RIS, and PVT, it is required to enable these neurons to control enteric functions. Taken together, pha-4 is the only transcription factor known to date that is expressed in and required for the proper function of all distinct types of enteric neurons in a nervous system.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Objectives: To train and validate a machine learning model to distinguish paper mill publications from genuine cancer research articles, and to screen the cancer research literature to assess the prevalence of papers that have textual similarities to paper mill papers. Design: Methodological study applying a BERT-based text classification model to article titles and abstracts. Setting: Retracted paper mill publications listed in the Retraction Watch database were used for model training. The cancer research corpus was screened by the model, using the PubMed database restricted to original cancer research articles published between 1999 and 2024. Participants: The model was trained on 2,202 retracted paper mill papers and validated on independent data collected by image integrity experts. A total of 2.6 million cancer research papers were screened. Main outcome measures: Classification performance of the model. Prevalence of papers flagged as similar to retracted paper mill publications with 95% confidence intervals and their distribution over time, by country, publisher, cancer type, research area, and within high-impact journals (Decile 1). Results: The model achieved an accuracy of 0.91. When applied to the cancer research literature, it flagged 9.87% (95% CI 9.83 to 9.90) of papers and revealed a large increase in flagged papers from 1999 to 2024, both across the entire corpus and in the top 10% of journals by impact factor. Over 170,000 papers affiliated with Chinese institutions were flagged, accounting for 35% of Chinese cancer research articles. Most publishers had published substantial numbers of flagged papers. Flagged papers were overrepresented in fundamental research and in gastric, bone, and liver cancer. Conclusions: Paper mills are a large and growing problem in the cancer literature and are not restricted to low impact journals. Collective awareness and action will be crucial to address the problem of paper mill publications.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

C.-C.", "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, manipulates host gene expression through multiple mechanisms, including disruption of RNA processing. Here, we identify a novel function of the viral nonstructural protein 14 (NSP14) in inducing N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification in the internal sequences of host mRNA. We demonstrate that NSP14 catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to m7GTP, which is subsequently incorporated into mRNA by RNA polymerase II, resulting in widespread internal m7G modification. This activity is dependent on NSP14's N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain and is enhanced by interaction with NSP10. Internal m7G modification by NSP14 predominantly occurs in the nucleus and is conserved across alpha-, beta- and gamma-coronaviruses. Mechanistically, we show that this RNA modification disrupts normal splicing by promoting intron retention and generating novel splice junctions. Importantly, inhibition of m7G modification, through pharmacological targeting of NSP14 or RNA polymerase II, impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication, indicating that the virus hijacks host transcriptomic machinery to support infection. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized epitranscriptomic mechanism by which coronaviruses reprogram host gene expression and suggest that NSP14-induced m7G modification is a potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Yet correlation structure is ubiquitous in real data, so these assumptions are often not met in practice. Whitening transformations are widely applied to remove this correlation structure. Existing approaches to whitening are based on standard linear algebra, rather than a probabilistic model, and application to high dimensional datasets with n samples and p features is problematic as p approaches or exceeds n. Moreover, the computational time becomes prohibitive since the naive transform is cubic in p. Here we propose a probabilistic model for data whitening and examine its properties based on first principles as p increases. We demonstrate the statistical properties of the probabilistic model and derive a remarkably efficient algorithm that is linear instead of cubic time in the number of features. We examine the out-of-sample performance of the probabilistic whitening model on simulated data, and real genotype data. In an application to impute z-statistics from unobserved genetic variants from a genome-wide association study of schizophrenia, the probabilistic whitening transformation, had the lowest mean square error while being up to an order of magnitude faster than other methods.

However, much remains to be understood about the precise mechanisms by which the osteocyte network regulates bone formation and bone resorption based on the propagation of biochemical signals emitted in response to mechanical stimulus. In this work, we propose a simple one-dimensional computational model of bone mechanical adaptation based on the propagation of signalling molecules through a dynamic osteocyte network. The osteocyte network is extended during bone formation, and reduced during bone resorption, which affects the generation and propagation of the signalling molecules to the bone surface. We explore how this osteocyte-based model of bone mechanosensation and mechanoresponse gives rise to effective Wolff's laws, in which overloaded bone is consolidated and underloaded bone is removed. We find that the discrete addition and removal of osteocytes significantly affects signalling molecules propagating to the bone surface and leads to new bone adaptation behaviours compared to earlier models, including partial bone recovery following an unloading and reloading cycle, and the emergence of a minimum threshold of mechanical stress below which all bone is resorbed. While many extensions of this mathematical model are possible, it provides a first illustration of how the osteocyte network could act as a dynamic embedded control network for bone adaptation to mechanical loads.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Subsequently, the activated GR signal is transduced to SpoVA proteins that constitute transport channels. The opening of the SpoVA channel then leads to calcium dipicolinic acid (CaDPA) release and then completion of spore germination. Spores are known to exhibit memory in germination, as spores given an initial short germinant pulse respond more readily to a second pulse. We have developed a mathematical model to identify a minimal reconstructed molecular network that is crucial for germination kinetics leading to memory of germinant exposure; the model reproduces experimental double germinant pulse germination curves. Analysis of the reconstructed network indicates that a minimal set of inactive and active GRs and a SpoVA channel in three states - closed inactive, closed active and open - is needed to reproduce memory. Spore germination memory is introduced in the network by the activation and deactivation rates of GRs, and by the interplay between activation of closed SpoVA channels and their rate of opening and closing.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

However, whether skeletal muscle retains a \"memory\" of disuse remains unknown. We investigated repeated lower-limb immobilization in young adults and a refined aged rat model of repeated disuse, integrating physiology, multi-omics, immunohistochemistry, biochemistry, and primary human cell analyses. In young human muscle, a second period of disuse elicited an attenuated transcriptional response in oxidative and mitochondrial pathways, suggesting a protective molecular memory, although this did not translate into attenuated atrophy. In contrast, aged muscle exhibited a detrimental molecular memory, with greater atrophy, exaggerated suppression of aerobic metabolism genes/pathways despite recovery of these genes after initial disuse, depletion of NAD and mitochondrial DNA, and activation of proteasomal, extracellular matrix and DNA-damage pathways. Repeated disuse induced DNA hypermethylation and downregulation of aerobic metabolism and mitochondrial genes across species. NR4A1 remained suppressed into recovery after initial disuse in young human muscle, whereas acetylcholine receptor subunit genes (e.g., CHRNA1, CHRND) were epigenetically primed in humans and further upregulated with repeated atrophy in both young and aged muscle. NMRK2, an NAD+ biosynthesis gene, was among the most downregulated genes after both periods of atrophy in humans, and nicotinamide riboside (NR) improved myotube size in primary human muscle cells derived post-atrophy. These findings reveal that disuse atrophy imprints a molecular memory in skeletal muscle - attenuated transcriptional resilience in young adults yet exaggerated susceptibility in aged muscle.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Diptera have undergone multiple sex-chromosome turnovers and expansions while maintaining their general chromosomal content, which makes them an ideal clade to study such transitions. We analysed more than 100 dipteran whole-genome assemblies and identified 4 new lineages that underwent sex-chromosome turnover (in addition to the 5 previously reported). We find the majority of turnovers happened in the group Schizophora, which tend to have fewer genes on the F element (the chromosome homologous to the ancestral insect X chromosome) than lower dipterans, a factor previously hypothesized to facilitate turnover. Most derived X chromosomes have higher GC content than autosomes, consistent with a high prevalence of male-achiasmy in Diptera. In addition, an excess of gene movement out of the X is detected for most of these new X chromosomes, and many of these moved genes have high testis expression in Drosophila, suggesting that out-of-X gene movement contributes to the long-term demasculinization of X chromosomes.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "This work develops a biophysical theory in which a bioelectric field V (x, t) and a cortical stress field{sigma} (x, t) are weakly and reciprocally coupled. Because the mechanical sector includes an inertial-viscoelastic element, the coupled system supports two underdamped normal modes whose interference defines a measurable slow cadence fslow = ({omega}+,r -{omega} -,r)/(2{pi}). Sampling the dynamics at the neutral moment (the recurring near-symmetric crossing between V and{sigma} ) produces an even circle map (mod{pi} ) for the slow phase, with effective forcing {Omega} and coupling K2. Both {Omega} and K2 can be computed a priori from directly measurable electrical and mechanical properties of the tissue (membrane time constant{tau} m, cortical stiffness{kappa} , viscosity , effective areal inertia{rho} eff, diffusion constants DV, D{sigma}, and weak electromechanical gains{gamma} , {beta}R, {beta}I), without arbitrary integer fitting. Helical quantization then appears as a mode-locking problem: the canonical B-DNA rotation number n {approx} 10.5 corresponds to the high-order lock{rho}{pi} = 2/21, whose center in this even (mod{pi} ) convention is {Omega}2/21 ={pi} {middle dot} 2/21.\n\nWe define a functional order parameter {Lambda} as the cross-spectral coherence CV{sigma}(fslow) between V and{sigma} at fslow. We hypothesize that high {Lambda} in (or repeatedly re-entering) the 2/21 tongue is associated with stable spindle orientation and cortical anchoring during division, constraining chromatin torsion and supporting controlled proliferation and differentiation. Drifting out of that tongue suggests two generic failure modes: (i) persistent unlocking with low {Lambda} and elevated spindle-angle dispersion (dysregulated proliferation and abnormal division geometry), and (ii) overlocked, low-plasticity states with a rigid slow cadence (aging-like overlock/drift). Appendix E formalizes this as a cycle-resolved \"re-entry\" analysis: healthy tissue is defined operationally as one that re-enters the 2/21 lock each slow cycle, rather than remaining permanently trapped or permanently lost.\n\nThe model yields three preregisterable and falsifiable predictions. (P1) Homeostatic epithelia exhibit a shared narrow slow-band cadence in both V and{sigma} , together with a coherence peak {Lambda} = CV{sigma}(fslow). (P2) The point ({Omega}, K2), obtained from those directly measurable properties together with neutral-moment stroboscopy, lies inside the 2/21 Arnold tongue while avoiding broad low-order tongues. (P3) A weak, frequency-specific electrical or mechanical drive at fslow is predicted to increase {Lambda} and reduce spindle-angle dispersion, whereas a matched off-resonant control should not. This phase-targeted entrainment mechanism is preregistered and computationally prevalidated in silico in Appendix F: in a synthetic proliferative-like unlocked state, an on-band drive at fslow selectively increases slow-band electromechanical coherence and stabilizes the neutral-map angular increment, while equally weak off-band drives do not. Experimental execution of P3 still requires fast dual-channel epithelial recordings from the same field of view.\n\nThis study provides analytical bounds, a numerical sandbox, and preregistered analysis code, enabling direct experimental falsification using combined optical electrophysiology and mechanical readouts.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Yet mapping the uptake of primary EV proteomes by human immune cells at single-cell resolution has been constrained by a lack of labeling strategies. We show here that TeLEV, a tellurium-based metabolic mass tagging approach that incorporates L-2-tellurienylalanine (TePhe) into EV proteomes, can produce a biologically rare monoisotopic signal, which is detectable by mass cytometry, imaging mass cytometry, and nanoscale SIMS, without perturbing EV morphology, yield, or proteome composition. We applied TeLEV to label primary malignant B-cell-derived EVs (MBC-EVs) from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and could follow EV uptake by distinct cell populations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. MBC-EV uptake occurred predominantly in cells of myeloid lineages. In direct control experiments with matched secreted proteins, a machine learning approach identified CD123, CD127, and CD25 as key markers distinguishing primary MBC-EV recipients from matched secreted protein recipient cells. Nanoscale imaging enabled localization of EV-delivered proteins within heterochromatin, whereas Te-labeled secreted proteins accumulated in the cytoplasm of recipient cells. We then generated a pan-immune EV uptake atlas by tracing the uptake of primary and cell-line EVs from nine cell lines and six donors with chronic lymphocytic leukemia into 2,977,094 recipient cells across 43 cell types and subpopulations. We found that the uptake of MBC-EVs by myeloid recipients induced monocyte-derived dendritic-cell polarization characterized by the co-expression of the interleukin-receptor triad (IL-RT: CD123, CD127, CD25) identified above. Time-resolved EV uptake analysis showed a rapid, transient expression of CD123/CD127 followed by CD25, both tightly coupled to MBC-EV uptake by myeloid cells. The intensity of IL-RT expression correlated with that of PD-L1 and BCL-2. Using different STAT degraders to bidirectionally modify the EV-induced STAT5 signal, we observed that MBC-EV uptake and IL-RT, PD-L1, and BCL-2 expression increased with STAT3 degradation and decreased with STAT5 degradation. To investigate the functional consequences of the MBC-EV-induced changes, we showed that MBC-EVs in the presence of IL-2 induced a high-CD25 immune state with low cytotoxic and high B cell proliferation.

Functional assays to establish pathogenicity of human variants is a key limiting factor in the clinical interpretation of genetic findings. Methods based on radioactive [3H]-GABA uptake come with significant regulatory concerns, cost, and workflow complexity, which could be resolved by an alternate assay. To address this issue, we developed a high-content fluorescence imaging assay of GAT-1-mediated GABA uptake using a genetically encoded GABA sensor, iGABA-Snfr. We demonstrated that pathogenic variants strongly reduced uptake (mean, -89.4% [95% CI, -71.5% to -107.3%]). Some variants of uncertain significance (VUS) were associated with reduced GABA uptake (G111R, S459R, V511M; mean, -101.2% [95% CI -81.1% to -121.3%]), whereas others showed only mild reduction (R211C, R566H, F242V, R419C; mean, -33.6% [95% CI -17.2% to -50.1%]), supporting variant reclassification.

However, its utility is limited by the overwhelming abundance of ribosomal RNA (rRNA), which typically represents [&ge;]90% of total RNA [1-2]. A major obstacle to efficient MetaT analysis is the removal of highly abundant rRNA transcripts present in complex microbial communities, which may contain thousands of species. Although commercial rRNA depletion kits can effectively reduce rRNA content, they are typically optimized for specific host microbiomes and often underperform in others. For example, probes designed for the human gut microbiome frequently show reduced efficiency when applied to non-human samples such as mouse cecal donor samples - a common model in microbiome research. Regardless of the depletion strategy used, designing rRNA removal probes solely based on a microbiome's taxonomic composition often requires an extensive number of probes, making the approach expensive, difficult to manufacture, and sometimes technically impractical [3]. Here, we present RiboZAP, a species-agnostic computational pipeline for designing custom RNase H depletion probes directly from MetaT sequencing data and without prior knowledge of sample composition. Our results show that the probes generated with RiboZAP are efficient for removal of rRNA content, increasing messenger RNA (mRNA), and improving transcriptome coverage. This provides a cost-effective approach to maximize the value of MetaT sequencing.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Our models reveal that neural populations spontaneously organize stimulus representations into probability-dependent geometric manifolds, where rare events occupy expanded state space. Hierarchical connectivity creates 9-fold signal amplification with enhanced noise robustness, explaining P300s functional advantages over sensory responses. Critically, the same synaptic mechanism accounts for attentional modulation of behaviorally relevant stimuli, providing the first unified explanation bridging automatic and controlled attention.

Successful infection in mammals requires the coordinated activity of stage-specific virulence factors. The zinc metalloprotease glycoprotease 63 (GP63) is a well-established virulence determinant critical for host cell attachment and invasion by insect-stage promastigotes. For humans, subsequent parasite propagation depends exclusively on intracellular amastigotes arising from lysed macrophages. Classical GP63 expression and function in Ld amastigotes remain poorly understood, and GP63 null mutants reportedly retain infectivity in mice, raising fundamental questions about virulence factor complementation during mammalian infection. By employing comparative transcriptomics, CRISPR-based mutagenesis, complemented with cell biology, and biochemical assays, this work identifies and characterizes multiple Ld GP63 paralogues with distinct roles in mammalian infection. While both copies of GP63 encoded on chromosome 10 (LdGP63_10.51 and 10.52) were functionally redundant, LdGP63_28 encoded on chromosome 28 proved essential for intracellular amastigote survival by suppressing host cell pyroptosis. Moreover, LdGP63_31 (chromosome 31) was found to primarily mediate promastigote attachment to the host macrophages with minimal contribution from LdGP63_28, facilitating initial infection establishment and amastigote genesis. Importantly, the absence of LdGP63_28 impacted amastigote infection more severely as compared to LdGP63_31. Structural and enzymatic analyses revealed divergent localization and substrate specificities to fulfil functional requirement of these divergent proteases, which have evolved independently to carry out diverse function in establishing infection. Collectively, this study indicates evolutionary divergence and functional specialization among GP63 isoforms in Ld by demonstrating that amastigote-specific and promastigote-specific GP63 isoforms synergistically mediate infection establishment and persistence.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we found that gpi-1 knockout animals display germline defects consistent with impaired PPP, and somatic defects consistent with impaired glycolysis. We discovered that two GPI-1 isoforms are differentially expressed and localized: GPI-1A is expressed in most tissues, where it displays cytosolic localization, whereas GPI-1B is primarily expressed in the germline, where it localizes to subcellular foci near the endoplasmic reticulum. GPI-1B expression alone is sufficient to maintain wild type levels of reproductive fitness, but insufficient to reconstitute wild-type glycolytic dynamics.

In this work we demonstrate the utility of high-field 7T MRI compared to 3T MRI for facilitating PFM in infants. We showcase data from multi-echo fMRI acquisitions in the same infants at both 7T and 3T and demonstrate that 7T imaging in infants is safe and feasible with our subject-specific safety workflow. Moreover, we demonstrate that the use of a higher magnetic field strength affords a spatial resolution more appropriately matched to infants' smaller head and brain sizes, yielding notable improvements in data quality, especially for PFM. The increase in both spatial precision and reliability also suggests that 7T MRI can reduce the amount of data required for PFM.

However, it remains unclear how the temporal modulation of {beta}-band SMR varies among individuals, potentially leading to individual differences in CMC. It is also unclear how the nervous system modulates {beta}-band SMR to meet varying task demands within individuals. Here, we explored how temporal modulation patterns of {beta}-band SMR affect CMC from two perspectives: inter-individual differences (Experiment 1), and intra-individual variability depending on task demands (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, participants repeated a steady-force maintenance task. The degree of {beta}-band SMR modulation (i.e., rebound from desynchronization to synchronization) during contractions varied greatly among individuals and was positively correlated with CMC magnitude. This suggests that even under steady-force maintenance, the motor control strategy used while regulating {beta}-band SMR varies greatly among individuals. In Experiment 2, participants who showed significant CMC in Experiment 1 performed four tasks with varying target trajectories. Even within individuals, the degree of {beta}-band SMR modulation was reduced in parallel with the CMC magnitude as more difficult force adjustment was required. This finding suggests that, when confronted with more challenging task demands, our nervous system reduces the oscillation of SMR and desynchronizes its coupling with muscles. Overall, the way in which our nervous system regulates {beta}-band SMR is assumed to represent a strategy for flexible adaptation to diverse motor environments.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

We test the multiple alternatives-co-activation hypothesis by combining high-density ECoG during spontaneous dialogue with behavioral paradigms and ranked next-word predictions from large language models (LLMs). Behaviorally, words that LLMs rank as more likely continuations are recognized faster in a preregistered lexical decision task and produced with shorter inter-word intervals in free speech, indicating graded anticipatory activation of alternatives. Neurally, encoding models reveal that activity in classical language regions (IFG, STG) prior to word onset is predicted by embeddings of multiple top-ranked alternatives, not only by the word ultimately used; critically, mean embeddings that pool the top candidates outperform single-candidate embeddings, and the effect persists with arbitrary (non-semantic) embeddings that control for distributional similarity. Extending beyond a handful of options, encoding strength increases as embeddings are averaged across larger top-k sets, implying that a broad cohort of lexical candidates is simultaneously represented. Finally, models trained in comprehension generalize to production (and vice versa), preserving rank order and suggesting a shared neural code for candidate sets across modalities. Together, these findings provide direct evidence that the brain co-activates unsaid alternatives during natural language use and identify parallel candidate activation as a computational principle common to human comprehension, human production, and artificial language modeling.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Some, but not all, deaf children find learning to read challenging, due to reduced access to language, whether spoken or signed. In hearing children, the ability to access and manipulate well-specified, abstract  phonological representations of spoken language is important for developing strong reading skills. However, the role that phonology plays in deaf children learning to read is much less clear. Positive associations between speechreading (lip reading) and text reading have been observed in deaf and hearing children, and deaf adults, suggesting that speechreading may play a role in reading development, regardless of hearing status. Further support for this hypothesis would be provided by evidence that similar neural representations of phonology are evoked by visual speech and other language forms (auditory speech and text), and that these neural representations are related to reading proficiency. We used fMRI and Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to identify shared neural representations of phonology. A group of deaf adult participants (N=22), with a mixture of sign language and spoken language backgrounds and reading abilities, were presented with single lexical items as visual speech and text. Adult hearing participants (N=25) were presented with the same words, but as visual speech and auditory speech. We hypothesised that common neural representations of phonological structure of English words would be found in each group in the superior and middle temporal cortex (STC/MTC) and that these shared representations would be more similar across different language forms in better readers.

Yet cognitive neuroscience has long treated body movements as artifacts, leaving unclear how neural computations and overt actions combine to support cognition. Here, we propose that targeted head rotations act as behavioral filters of relevant input under distraction. We show that selective attention is jointly implemented by neural filtering (lateralization of alpha oscillations) and head rotation. In a cued auditory spatial attention task, N = 33 human participants attended to lateral targets or ignored lateral distractors. Neural oscillatory activity, the electrooculogram (EOG), and head movements were recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) and a head-mounted gyroscope. In half of the trials, we purposefully allowed free movements of the head. Listeners exhibited robust patterns of head rotation towards lateral targets, which improved task accuracy by reducing target uncertainty. Note that significant movement residues remained even when head motion was discouraged. Neural filtering, measured as decreased alpha oscillations contralateral to targets and vice versa for distractors, was assessable for conditions with and without head movement permitted but did not relate to task accuracy. Critically, neural and behavioral filters were positively linked on a trial-by-trial and on a between-subject level, with neural filtering preceding behavioral filtering in time. Together, these results underscore that selective attention arises from coordinated brain-body dynamics, highlighting the need to integrate overt movement into mechanistic models of cognition.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Z.", "abstract": "When listening to speech in their native language, speakers use prior context to anticipate upcoming phonemes, words, and concepts, integrating information at the sublexical, lexical, and sentence level. While it has been suggested that late second language learners do not predict to the same extent as native listeners, adequately evaluating this claim requires measurement of predictions at these multiple levels of representation simultaneously in natural speech. We recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) responses from native Mandarin and Sinhala speakers listening to continuous narrative English speech. We used multivariate temporal response function (mTRF) analysis to investigate whether second language listeners demonstrate the same markers of prediction in neural data as native English speakers listening to the same stimuli. We demonstrate that late second language listeners exhibit strikingly similar responses to native speakers in sensitivity to phoneme surprisal and entropy with respect to sublexical, lexical, and sentence-level context. The few small response differences we observed appear most likely to arise from specific properties of the native languages, rather than general differences between native and second-language listening. These results provide evidence that late second-language listeners indeed leverage prediction in similar ways as native listeners in understanding continuous speech. This suggests that multivariate analyses of neural data from naturalistic listening may be vital in carefully evaluating the differences and similarities in speech prediction across populations.\n\nSignificance StatementMuch is still unknown about how people listening to a second language predict upcoming words and sounds. Here, we leverage neuroimaging during continuous speech and analyze responses to multiple speech language features in the signal to study the neural encoding of prediction simultaneously at multiple levels of linguistic context. We observe robust encoding of statistical properties tied to prediction at all context levels in second-language learners of English and that responses are strikingly similar between native and second language listeners. Speech language features are encoded similarly in both groups of language learners, with few differences between the native and second language listeners, indicating that second language listeners predict upcoming input similarly to native listeners.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

A. Ioannidis from Stanford University captures a lot of attention worldwide. Professor Ioannidis introduced a new marker to evaluate a researcher's contributions named the composite score (C-Score). The C-Score provided an excellent metric to determine where an author stands in comparison to others within the global research community. However, while the C-Score effectively ranks researchers, it is not particularly helpful for new researchers seeking to evaluate potential mentors or guides. Emerging researchers want to know if potential mentors prioritize quantity or quality. They also seek clarity about research output requirements when joining a team. Objective: We address this gap with The Research Mind framework. It introduces two new metrics: the S-Score, which measures research quantity and productivity, and the Q-Score, which measures research quality and impact. These metrics help new researchers choose mentors wisely by going beyond traditional ranking systems. Method: We developed the S-Score to measure maximum average first-author publications over any three-year period. This provides insights into productivity expectations. We also created the Q-Score to evaluate maximum median citations for first or last author works over three years. This indicates research quality and impact. Additionally, we implemented comprehensive self-citation analysis to assess research integrity. The framework was built using the OpenAlex database and includes network analysis capabilities for collaboration pattern visualization. Results: Our analysis uncovered significant differences between C-Score rankings and a researcher's suitability for mentorship. We found that some researchers had high C-Scores but also had S-Scores of 10, meaning they published 10 papers per year. This is an unusually high productivity rate that may be unsustainable for most researchers. In contrast, researchers publishing one paper per year had Q-Scores above 50, making them potentially better mentors for quality-focused research. Our self-citation analysis revealed concerning patterns, with high self-citation rates (over 20%) indicating potentially problematic research practices. Conclusions: The Research Mind framework provides essential complementary metrics to Ioannidis's C-Score system, enabling new researchers to evaluate potential guides or mentors based on productivity expectations (S-Score) and quality focus (Q-Score) rather than solely on composite rankings. This approach will help emerging researchers identify mentors whose research philosophy and output expectations align with their career goals and capabilities. Hence, The Research Mind framework addresses a critical gap in academic mentorship selection. To facilitate widespread adoption and accessibility, we have developed a comprehensive web application. This app allows researchers to easily search, analyze, and compare these metrics for any author or researcher. The platform is freely available at www.theresearchmind.com/trm-app, providing an intuitive interface for exploring S-Scores, Q-Scores, self-citation patterns, collaboration networks, and overall evaluation metrics to support informed academic decision-making.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

These maturation processes heighten psychiatric vulnerability to environmental exposures, including to toxicants such as insecticides. Epidemiological studies show widespread adolescent insecticide exposure and increasingly link this with psychiatric outcomes, yet underlying neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Preclinical studies can clarify these associations and identify insecticide-induced mechanisms that may disrupt neurodevelopment and produce consequent long-term behavioral outcomes. Here, we performed a systematic review of rodent studies following PRISMA guidelines. 50 original articles met inclusion criteria, examining neurotoxic outcomes following insecticide exposure during adolescence (postnatal days 21-60). Outcomes were categorized into four domains: neurocognitive, neuropsychiatric, neurobiological, and general neurotoxicity. Risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. Across studies, insecticide exposure during adolescence led to learning and memory impairments and tended to increase depression relevant behaviors, alter locomotor activity, and produce general neurotoxic effects. Mechanistic findings highlighted disruptions in cholinergic and monoaminergic signaling, oxidative stress, neuroimmune changes, and cell death and other neurodegenerative processes. Together, these findings indicate adolescent insecticide exposure disrupts multiple neural systems with behavioral consequences relevant to adolescent development and psychiatric risk. Future research should model real-world exposures (e.g. dose, timing) to better inform translational understanding of adolescent psychiatric vulnerability. Because many life-long neuropsychiatric disorders emerge in adolescence, identifying how modifiable environmental exposures shape risk offers an opportunity for prevention and intervention strategies to alter the course of disease across the lifespan.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Methods: We analyzed 1,488 participants with autopsy-confirmed neuropathology and at least two caregiver-reported NPI-Q assessments. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess associations between apathy and six neuropathologies, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy body disease (LBD), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), hippocampal sclerosis (HS), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). with time modeled as years to death and including interaction terms.

Results: Apathy prevalence increased over time across all pathology groups. FTLD (OR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.32-3.39) and HS (OR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.38-3.60) were consistently associated with higher odds of apathy throughout the disease course.

European alpine peatlands share certain characteristics with boreal peatlands, despite being located at temperate latitudes, such as a strong seasonality with snowfall in winter and a short summer and growing season. Unlike boreal peatlands, they experience relatively large temperature fluctuations between day and night and are more likely to be sloping. It is unknown how these factors affect methane dynamics. Furthermore, winter methane dynamics have rarely been studied. We therefore quantified the soil-atmosphere methane flux at an alpine peatland in Austria (1700 m a.s.l), with a focus on the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in this ecosystem. In summer, methane emissions were high (49 mg m2 h-1), whereas in spring, shortly after snowmelt, both methane uptake and emissions were observed at different locations within the alpine peatland. In winter, a local snow-free patch persisted at the peatland due to the year-round influx of 5{degrees}C spring water. We compared the methane flux from this snow-free patch to another alpine peatland which also contained such a snow-free area and observed methane emissions at the one peatland (1.2 mg m2 h-1) and methane uptake at the other (-0.06 mg m2 h-1). The input of spring water in combination with the sloping nature of the peatlands resulted in a large spatial heterogeneity, likely as a result of the input of redox-active components such as sulfate by the spring water. The microbial community composition also suggested the presence of active sulfur, iron and methane cycling in the peat soil. Overall, our research shows that alpine peatlands are unique systems due to the year-round spring water throughput, altering biogeochemical cycles and creating local snow-free conditions, with implications for methane cycling.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

V.; Poiyamozhi, H.; Biswas, S.; Mohannath, G.", "abstract": "Ribonuclease P (RNase P), a ribozyme conserved across all domains of life, is involved in the tRNA 5' maturation. RNase P recognizes precursor tRNA based on its structure, not the tRNA sequence. This feature had been exploited to engineer RNase P to selectively target and cleave any RNA as a gene inactivation strategy. Of these, a strategy called M1GS involves tethering an Escherichia coli M1 RNA to a short stretch of guide sequence (GS), which is complementary to the RNA targeted for cleavage. Despite its simplicity and versatility, M1GS tool appears to be underutilized compared to other gene inactivation strategies. Perhaps one of the reasons is that employment of the M1GS strategy requires prior knowledge about the requirements of the M1GS target sites. To facilitate its broader use, we have developed a Python script-based user-friendly bioinformatic tool built based on the requirements of M1GS to predict its target sites for any given RNA (using either DNA or RNA sequence as an input). In this study, we first demonstrate the utility of the bioinformatic tool in predicting M1GS target sites for human 28S rRNA and then we show that the customized M1GS-mediated downregulation of 28S rRNA in a human cancer cell line. We further validate the bioinformatic tool by predicting M1GS target sites for two previously targeted RNAs. Lastly, we discuss the utility of M1GS ribozyme-mediated rRNA downregulation as a potential anticancer modality in cancers where rRNAs are upregulated.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

However, climate change will threaten phylogenetic diversity when extinctions are phylogenetically clustered. Despite the importance of phylogenetic diversity for current and future ecosystems, and the potential unique insights it offers into communities, few studies have quantified its long-term changes. Here, we leverage a dataset spanning approximately 65 years and 1500 m of elevation in the Colorado Rocky Mountains to test for changes in phylogenetic diversity in angiosperm communities. We included four community types (sagebrush, spruce-fir, upland-herb, alpine), which vary in the direction and magnitude of changes in species richness over this period. We tested whether individual species' responses to climate change could be predicted by phylogeny, including changes to abundance, constancy (% of sites occupied), and elevational range. We did not find phylogenetic signal in abundance change in any community, but we did find phylogenetic signal in both constancy shifts in alpine and elevational shifts in sagebrush communities. We then tested for changes in phylogenetic diversity across time for each community type. We found that phylogenetic diversity changed in the same direction as species richness in the sagebrush community, where both declined, and in the upland-herb, where both increased, with important roles for both species gains and losses in community phylogenetic composition. The alpine community did not change in phylogenetic diversity, although richness declined, while the spruce-fir community increased in phylogenetic diversity but did not change in richness, emphasizing the potential for changes in different aspects of diversity to be decoupled. Our work highlights that the impacts of climate change vary across communities, and that phylogeny is shaping changes in certain systems. Given the importance of phylogenetic diversity to ecosystem function, long term studies are essential for understanding how climate change impacts phylogenetic diversity in distinct community types with unique responses to climate change.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

V.; Li, M.", "abstract": "The oxygenation of ancient Earth is thought to have driven eukaryogenesis, beginning with the endosymbiosis of an aerobic alphaproteobacterium (proto-mitochondria) with an archaeal host. Given that the archaeal host likely evolved from within Asgard archaea (phylum Promethearchaeota), the metabolic traits of Asgard archaea could provide key insights into eukaryotic origins. Although Asgard archaea cultured to date are obligate anaerobes, their genomes encode oxygen-adaptive proteins, suggesting they might be oxygen-tolerant. Here, we demonstrate that some Asgard archaea, in particular, Hodarchaeales, the closest known relatives of eukaryotes, and Kariarchaeaceae, exhibit oxygen adaptation mediated by terminal oxidase and globin. Phylogenetic analysis reveals long-term vertical evolution of terminal oxidases in Asgard archaea, suggesting ancient adaptation to molecular oxygen. By contrast, globin was likely acquired by Asgard archaea via horizontal gene transfer from facultative aerobic Chloroflexales bacteria. Heterologous expression of the Asgard globin enhances aerobic growth of Haloarchaea and Escherichia coli in the presence of terminal oxidase-dependent electron transfer chain, suggesting that Asgard growth benefits from ambient oxygen. The Asgard globin gene is embedded in an oxygen-sensitive bidirectional promoter region, with one promoter driving oxygen-induced globin expression, and the other anaerobically activating expression of two enzymes, PdxS and PdxT, involved in a pyridoxal 5-phosphate biosynthesis. The Asgard globin and promoter region exhibit high functional robustness across archaea and bacteria, and could contribute to the symbiosis between the Asgard and aerobic bacterial partners. These findings highlight the oxygen-adaptive plasticity of Asgard archaea and its potential contribution to eukaryogenesis.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Moreover, the aim was to evaluate if an expression signature, based on optimized short-amplicon primers, was able to differentiate porcine experimental granulation tissue according to age and if this could be used for wound age assessment in veterinary forensic cases. Initially, 12 samples of experimental granulation tissue (n=6) and skin (n=6) from two pigs were deliberately exposed to RNA degrading conditions before being stored in RNAlater. A panel of 24 robust primers were selected based on the intentionally degraded samples. Granulation tissue (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 days of age) (n=94) and control skin (n=47) from 47 experimental pigs was sampled and stored in RNAlater. Furthermore, granulation tissue and fibrous scar tissue were sampled from 14 veterinary forensic cases. Microfluidic qPCR was performed to evaluate the gene expression of 24 genes. An expression signature of 14 genes reflected the age of the experimental wounds. The 5-day old wounds displayed the biggest divergence from the control skin. As the granulation tissue matured, gene expression gradually approached the levels observed in intact skin. The forensic samples clustered somewhat separately from the experimental samples. In conclusion, granulation tissue from the experimental wounds displayed a time-dependent expression profile based on 14 short-amplicon primers suitable for use with low-quality RNA. However, an expression profile of 14 genes cannot be used as the sole method for forensic age assessments of porcine wounds.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana), the sole North American member of its genus, is distributed in mountain forests from northern Mexico to northern British Columbia. A seed predator, N. columbiana is highly reliant on pine nuts from Pinus spp. conifers, which it both consumes directly from cones and caches for future use. Because cached seeds are often forgotten or abandoned, it is a major seed disperser for high elevation pines---in particular Whitebark Pine P. albicaulis. Previous studies of genetic variation in Clark's Nutcracker found range-wide panmixia and generally high levels of heterozygosity at a handful of nuclear and mitochondrial loci, potentially due to seasonal elevational movements and long term dispersal. An earlier genome assembly from low-coverage short read data was highly fragmented and has not to date been used as the basis for population-level resequencing. Here we report on the first chromosome-scale genome assembly for N. colombiana. We generated long-read sequencing and genome conformation mapping data from tissues sampled from a male N. columbiana individual in Wyoming, USA. These data were assembled into a highly contiguous and complete assembly, which showed strong chromosomal synteny with New Caledonian crow (Corvus moneduloides). This genome has relatively low heterozygosity compared to other Corvid genomes and to previous population-level heterozygosity estimates for the species. We also found evidence of a long-term decline in effective population size dating back to the Pleistocene, after accounting for a technical artifact common to demographic inference using the pairwise sequential Markovian coalescent. These findings raise concerns about the future viability of the species and its mutualist P. albicaulis; we hope the assembly will motivate further comparative and conservation genomics research.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Despite effective targeted therapies, HR+ breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Long-standing epidemiological research identifies significantly worse outcomes for Black women diagnosed with HR+ breast cancer relative to White women. While structural factors such as access to healthcare and education level contribute to this outcome disparity, it persists even in analyses where these factors are controlled. In-depth analyses of the somatic molecular biology that may underlie these outcome disparities are hampered by a lack of datasets that represent Black patient populations. Here, we generate a HR+ breast cancer patient transcriptomic dataset that overrepresents Black women and controls for access to healthcare and education level. We find that signatures relating to the tumor microenvironment, i.e. collagen deposition and prognostically unfavorable T-cell landscapes are enriched in HR+ tumors from Black women. Importantly, we find, using experimental model systems in vitro and in vivo, that race-aligned collagen deposition patterns are at least partially attributable to tumor cell-intrinsic signaling and critical for Black breast cancer metastasis. We also find that unfavorable T-cell signatures in HR+ tumors from Black women, which have previously been attributed to race and ancestry, are more strongly poverty-aligned. Using multiple independent datasets, we identify STAT4 as a potential master regulator of this poverty-associated tumor immune signature. Together, these findings provide new evidence that somatic molecular biology of breast cancer patients can be modified by multiple structural factors such as self-identified race and poverty burden to promote poor patient outcomes.

Pretraining alleviates this challenge but incurs substantial costs and depends heavily on large chemical corpora. We propose PyrMol, a knowledge-structured pyramid representation learning framework that integrates multiple chemical expertise into GNNs. PyrMol constructs heterogeneous pyramid molecular graphs comprising atomic, subgraph, and molecular levels, enabling hierarchical message passing guided by functional groups, pharmacophores, and reaction-derived fragments. A multi-source knowledge fusion module adaptively aggregates heterogeneous subgraph signals, while a hierarchical contrastive strategy aligns representations across scales to enhance discrimination and consistency. Across 10 public benchmarks, PyrMol consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art baselines, including advanced subgraph-enhanced architectures and leading pretraining models. Moreover, incorporating pyramid graphs into existing GNNs yields universal performance gains, demonstrating the plug-and-play versatility of framework.

To overcome this, we developed a multi-feature machine learning paradigm by extracting multiple mouse behavioral metrics, standardizing them as features to train machine learning models, thereby achieving reliable and automated vision assessment. We systematically compared the classification performance of single-metric versus multi-feature machine learning approaches in sighted and blind mice, using wild-type and rhodopsin-deficient mice, with a subset further subjected to double optic nerve crush. We found that the multi-feature method can improve classification performance and exhibit great robustness to different experimental settings. Additionally, we further improved model performance by applying feature importance analysis and constructing an optimized feature subset. These findings suggest that the reliability of commonly used single dwell time measure for vision assessment could become unreliable, as shown in our experiment, probably because in addition to vision other factors also impact dwell time.

Participants (n=28) were shown 14 targets that varied in size, value and location, and were instructed to accumulate as many points as possible. To collect each target, they reached while holding the handle of a robotic manipulandum that applied a resistive force. We analyzed their target choices using a planning model that takes into account the size, value and distance of several future targets. We expected that, as resistance -- and therefore the effort required to move between two targets -- increased, participants would plan further ahead to minimize total movement distance. Results show that participants typically planned 2-4 targets ahead. However, increasing resistance did not significantly affect the planning horizon.

These extended dependencies underlie other emergent properties of critical dynamics, such as high susceptibility and multi-scale coordination. In the brain, along with other signatures of criticality, long-range correlations have been observed across various spatial scales, suggesting that the brain may operate near a critical point to optimise information processing and adaptability. However, the mechanisms underlying these long-range correlations remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the role of synergistic interactions in mediating long-range correlations in the visual cortex of awake mice. We leverage recent advances in mesoscale two-photon calcium imaging to analyse the activity of thousands of neurons across a wide field of view, allowing us to confirm the presence of long-range correlations at the level of neuronal populations. By applying the Partial Information Decomposition (PID) framework, we decompose the correlations into synergistic and redundant information interactions. Our results reveal that the increase in long-range correlations during visual stimulation is accompanied by a significant increase in synergistic rather than redundant interactions among neurons. Furthermore, we analyse a combined network formed by the union of synergistic and redundant interaction networks, and find that both types of interactions complement each other to facilitate efficient information processing across long distances. This complementarity is further enhanced during the visual stimulation. These findings provide new insights into the computational mechanisms that give rise to long-range correlations in neural systems and highlight the importance of considering different types of information interactions in understanding correlations in the brain.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

However, the available evidence is insufficient to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms and properties. To provide further comprehensive data on this issue, we combined ex vivo whole-cell recording with an optogenetic approach to study the synaptic transmission of mPFC inputs to LC neurons, including noradrenergic (NA) neurons and GABAergic neurons presynaptic to them (preLC neurons).

Aberrant calcium signaling is an established early event in sAD pathogenesis that is closely linked to neuroinflammation. Aged rhesus macaques are predominantly APOE-{epsilon}4 homozygotes and naturally exhibit cognitive decline, calcium dysregulation, amyloid deposition, and tau pathology, which allows for a translationally relevant animal model. We previously identified an evolutionarily expanded role for postsynaptic type 3 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR3) in dorsolateral prefrontal and entorhinal cortex, where they regulate cAMP-calcium opening of K+ channels to sustain neuronal firing and working memory. mGluR3 signaling is driven by N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) and constrained by glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), whose expression rises with age and inflammation. In prior work, chronic inhibition of GCPII with the orally bioavailable inhibitor 2-(3-mercaptopropyl) pentanedioic acid (2-MPPA) improved neuronal firing, working memory, and reduced pT217Tau pathology in aged macaques. Here, we employed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to define the proteomic consequences of chronic 2-MPPA treatment in vulnerable (entorhinal cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) versus resilient (primary visual cortex) regions. We identified >2,400 proteins across experimental conditions, and label-free quantification revealed region-specific differential expression patterns paralleling known vulnerability gradients in sAD. Gene ontology enrichment of vulnerable regions implicated pathways governing protein deneddylation, amyloid and tau-associated processes, synaptic plasticity, mitochondrial homeostasis, and oxidative stress, revealing putative targets for therapeutic intervention in sAD. These findings demonstrate that GCPII inhibition engages distinct, region-selective molecular programs in the aging primate cortex, consistent with the protection of circuits most vulnerable to sAD. By mapping the proteomic shifts that occur with treatment, we reveal molecular signatures that not only serve as candidate biomarkers but also highlight novel mechanistic pathways contributing to calcium-driven degeneration in sAD. As such, more focused investigations into these pathways of therapeutic interest are warranted, in addition to the analysis of key post-translational modifications and their potential roles in sAD.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

L.; Rinker, J. A.; Mulholland, P.

Unfortunately, current FDA-approved medications for alcohol use disorder (AUD) are not designed to also treat alcohol-induced cognitive dysfunction. KV7 channels are a class of voltage-gated potassium channels that regulate neuronal excitability and are implicated in cognitive function. KV7 channels are sensitive to acute and chronic alcohol exposure, and positive KV7 channel modulation reduces alcohol intake in high-drinking rodents. The impact of chronic alcohol exposure on KV7 physiology in the prelimbic cortex (PL), a region essential for cognitive function, remains unexplored. To address this, cognitive deficits were measured in male and female mice following the chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) model of alcohol dependence using a delayed alternation working memory task. After establishing that CIE elicits cognitive deficits regardless of sex, whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology recordings were performed on distinct PL pyramidal neurons; intratelencephalic (IT neurons) and extratelencephalic (ET neurons) projection neurons to measure KV7 channel mediated M-currents, along with evoked action potential firing following chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) exposure in male and female mice. CIE exposure led to an increase in intrinsic excitability and a decrease in M-current regardless of sex, which was largely driven by CIE-induced adaptations in IT neurons. These neural adaptations in dependent mice coincided with the emergence of working memory deficits. Microinjections of the KV7 positive modulator retigabine restored working memory function in male and female CIE-exposed mice. Together, these results indicate that chronic alcohol downregulates KV7 function within distinct cortical cell types, and that KV7 modulation may be a promising pharmacological treatment for alcohol induced cognitive impairment.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Dysregulation of the SCN is associated with various circadian disorders, highlighting the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting its neurons and output pathways. Vasopressin signaling is one of the main regulators of the synchronicity and the functional output of the SCN. Methods: We investigated the effect of a single dose (30mg/kg) of the vasopressin V1a receptor (V1aR) antagonist, balovaptan, on resynchronization of locomotor activity rhythms in mice after a 6-hour phase advance of the light-dark cycle. To mechanistically model the effect of V1aR antagonism, we developed a mathematical framework simulating the SCN, its control of circadian biomarkers (melatonin, core body temperature), and the impact of V1aR antagonism. Results: A single administration of the V1a antagonist balovaptan significantly accelerated resynchronization of locomotor activity rhythms to new light-dark cycles. To mechanistically understand this effect, we devised a mathematical model of the SCN that successfully captures this accelerated synchronization of circadian rhythms under V1aR antagonism. Additionally, the model replicates well-established SCN behaviors in both humans and rodents, including the phase response curve triggered by a light pulse at various circadian phases, and the desynchronization of the SCN observed in forced desynchronization experiments. Mechanistically, our model suggests that weakening vasopressin signaling via V1aR antagonism strengthens the SCN's resistance to internal desynchronization. Additionally, our model suggests a strong link between the endogenous period (tau) and the phase of circadian biomarkers, with longer tau values resulting in delayed biomarker rhythms. Importantly, the model predicts that V1aR antagonism induces a phase advance proportional to tau. The model predicts that individuals with longer endogenous periods, who consequently exhibit greater phase delays in their circadian rhythms, could experience more substantial phase advances in response to V1aR antagonism. Discussion: We show that targeting V1aR is enough to cause a faster resynchronization to a new light-dark cycle in the jet lag paradigm and establish a computational framework for investigating its therapeutic potential in circadian rhythm disorders. This framework, adaptable to incorporate pharmacodynamic data, can be used to design clinical trials evaluating V1aR antagonism for treating circadian disorders.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) acts as a joule-level analog of lightning, integrating light, sound, and reactive species to modulate AD progression in a mouse model. Using multimodal analyses, we show that CAP treatment enhances key neuroimmune signaling pathways in an AD murine model, including microglial activation, without inducing pathological alterations at the functional, transcriptomic, or proteomic levels in healthy mice. These findings highlight CAP as a safe and efficacious modality for modulating neurodegenerative processes, establishing a foundation for its therapeutic translation in AD and related disorders.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Perturbation outcomes depend on a cell's intrinsic state and also on how effects propagate across cellular microenvironments. We present CONCERT, a niche-aware generative model that embeds perturbation context and learns spatial kernels with a Gaussian process variational autoencoder to predict perturbation effects across tissue. We formalize three tasks: patch, border, and niche, predicting responses in nearby unperturbed regions, at tissue interfaces, and as a function of surrounding microenvironments. We evaluate CONCERT on Perturb-map lung datasets. CONCERT outperforms state-of-the-art models (dissociated counterfactuals, spatialized perturbation models, and kNN), reducing E-distance by up to 33.77% (patch), 26.05% (border), and 33.74% (niche) versus the next best, with mean absolute error down by up to 23.28% and Pearson correlation up by up to 9.10%. Two case studies go beyond benchmarking. In dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis, CONCERT reconstructs spatial gene expression at unmeasured time points, produces longitudinal comparisons across unpaired mice, resolves inter-mouse heterogeneity, and recovers consistent temporal declines of inflammation-associated genes across regions. In ischemic stroke, CONCERT predicts responses under variable lesion sizes and in a 3D formulation across brain sections, capturing lesion-core and peri-lesion patterns. CONCERT performs niche-aware counterfactual prediction, reconstructs missing spatial data, and models perturbation responses across tissues.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Both variables have been used to test hypotheses on the acquisition, generalization, and extinction of conditioned threat. Existing studies have largely relied on trial averages and group-level analyses. Thus, the variability of these physiological markers to aversive learning at the subject level is currently unknown. Comparisons of group-level analyses in prior studies suggest that pupil dilation and EEG-alpha activity capture complementary information. However, to date, no study has directly compared these two markers in terms of their effect sizes at the level of individual participants. The present study employed Bayesian multilevel modeling to quantify the variability of conditioning effect estimates for alpha-band power and pupillometry. Estimates were examined at the group level and at the participant level, across two conditioning paradigms, involving visual and auditory cues. Although the two metrics shared similar effect sizes at the group level, participant-level variability in these effect sizes was substantially higher for pupil-dilation compared to alpha-power, and this finding was replicated across both paradigms. These findings have important implications for clinical and inter-individual difference research which requires both the quantification of effects at the participant-level as well as meaningful variability between-participants that can be linked to relevant differences such as anxiety.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Here we investigated how neural responses to naturalistic stimuli evolve across multiple viewings using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty participants watched 24 short videos across five separate scanning sessions. Between-subject correlations (BSC) decreased progressively across all brain regions with repeated viewing, indicating increasing individual variability. Within-subject correlations (WSC) consistently exceeded BSC, demonstrating that individuals are more similar to themselves than to others. However, the structure of within-subject variability differed fundamentally between sensory and interpretive regions. Early visual cortex exhibited strong repetition effects, with brain activity becoming increasingly dissimilar with each successive viewing, accompanied by reduced coupling to low-level visual features and decreased anti-correlation with default mode regions. In contrast, ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) showed temporal proximity effects, where sessions closer in time exhibited more similar activity patterns regardless of viewing number. This temporal structure in vmPFC aligned with fluctuations in participants' video preferences across sessions. These findings suggest that repeated experiences are never processed identically: sensory systems adapt efficiently to familiar input while interpretive systems continuously reshape meaning based on current internal states.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

In addition, some of the reported markers for NDEV isolation are present as soluble proteins instead of extracellular vesicle (EV) associated proteins. To address the research gap, this study aimed to identify a novel marker for NDEV isolation that is NDEV associate and highly specific to the central nervous system. To achieve this, human cortical neurons were used for isolation of EVs invitro. Mass spectroscopy was performed to screen for potential EV surface markers. This analysis yielded 63 brain specific proteins among which ICAM-5 was selected for further validations in human serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples. Our analysis shows that ICAM-5 is present on the surface of NDEVs, colocalizing with standard extracellular vesicle markers like CD-63 and CD-9. We further confirm that NDEVs isolated using ICAM-5 contain neuronal proteins (tau, neuronal specific enolase) but not glial markers. Using ICAM-5 as a NDEV marker, EVs were eluted from human serum samples of with traumatic brain injury. Our results show enhanced levels of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), a marker of neurological injury, in serum samples from patients with TBI when compared to currently known markers of NDEV.

This study provides the first systematic examination of how psychosocial stress influences temporal versus spatial reproduction using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), investigating underlying epigenetic mechanisms. Forty-four healthy adults (21 men; mean age 21.96 +/- 3.03) completed temporal and spatial reproduction tasks before and after TSST, with salivary cortisol sampling and DNA methylation analysis of four dopamine-related genes (COMT, DRD2, SLC6A3, TH). The TSST successfully elevated cortisol and state anxiety, confirming effective HPA axis activation. Critically, stress selectively reduced temporal underestimation. Despite their shared neurocognitive mechanisms, spatial processing remained unchanged. This demonstrates that HPA-mediated stress enhances interval timing. Men demonstrated greater stress-induced improvement in temporal accuracy than women, while neither sex showed significant spatial changes, independent of cortisol reactivity differences. The results are discussed in the context of dopaminergic models of temporal processing. Exploratory epigenetic analyses revealed a DRD2 methylation and cortisol response interaction for temporal tasks, with higher methylation associated with greater stress-induced improvement among high cortisol responders. However, sensitivity analysis indicated these interactions were driven by participants with extreme methylation values, limiting the generalizability of epigenetic results. These findings demonstrate that acute psychosocial stress selectively enhances temporal accuracy, potentially through cortisol-dopamine interactions in corticostriatal timing circuits. This work opens avenues for investigating stress-timing mechanisms and cortisol-dopamine interactions in timing circuits, and provides preliminary evidence for epigenetic moderation.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

E.; Carnahan, R. M.; Chalkley, N.; Potter, R.; Dolan, K.; Nickl-Jockschat, T.; Wessel, J. R.", "abstract": "Background: Conscious error detection is accompanied by error-related changes in phasic autonomic activity. This autonomic response is diminished in older age - accompanied by impairments in the conscious detection of action errors - i.e., increased \"error blindness\". Indeed, the degree to which the autonomic response to errors declines across the lifespan is correlated with the increase in error blindness. However, the direction of causality - whether changes in autonomic reactivity are a consequence or cause of increased error blindness - is still debated. In the present study, we experimentally modulated the phasic autonomic response to action errors in healthy older adults while measuring their conscious error detection. Methods: Across two sessions, thirty healthy older adults (60-80 years old) were given the sNRI atomoxetine or placebo in a double-blind fashion. In each session, they performed an anti-saccade task, which is commonly used to test conscious error detection. The autonomic response to errors was measured via changes in pupil dilation. A novelty-oddball task was also employed as a manipulation check. Results: Atomoxetine reduced phasic pupil dilation to both novel stimuli in the novelty-oddball task and to action errors in the anti-saccade task. However, despite this blunting of the phasic autonomic response to errors, there were no significant differences in conscious error awareness between atomoxetine and placebo. Primary task performance was also unaffected. Conclusions: Despite its effects on phasic autonomic activity after errors, atomoxetine had no effect on conscious error detection in healthy older adults. This suggests that phasic autonomic activity is a consequence, rather than a contributing factor, to conscious error awareness. It also suggests that changes to phasic autonomic activity is unlikely to explain increased error blindness in older age.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Features extracted from movies span multiple levels, from computational descriptions of visual and auditory input to physiological signals and subjective ratings. However, the temporal alignment between these features and the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response can vary considerably, and the commonly used canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF) with temporal derivatives may not adequately capture these delays. In this study, we analyzed three movie-watching datasets and examined a range of features, including visual luminance and contrast, auditory pitch, a physiological measure of pupil size, and subjective ratings of theory of mind. We performed cross-correlation analyses between feature time series and fMRI responses across the whole brain. Our results show that the canonical HRF captures sensory features well but misaligns with slower signals such as pupil size and subjective ratings. Notably, raw pupil size and subjective ratings exhibited stronger correspondence with delayed hemodynamic responses. Lastly, we showed that video data can be used as continuous input to measure hemodynamic response functions across brain regions. These findings highlight the critical role of temporal alignment in mapping naturalistic features to brain activity.

M.; Janata, P.; Balasubramaniam, R.", "abstract": "Musical groove, defined as the urge to move in response to rhythmic stimuli, drives spontaneous entrainment and engagement with music. Recent studies have investigated the activation of the sensorimotor network (SMN), focusing on the mu rhythm, an oscillatory activity in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (16-24 Hz) ranges that reflects motor system engagement. While mu modulation differs between passive listening and active movement, it remains unclear whether these responses are shaped by the level of musical groove. Clarifying this relationship is crucial for understanding how neural oscillations transform rhythmic perception into embodied movement and how auditory and motor systems interact to generate the spontaneous urge to move. The present study investigates SMN dynamics by examining mu modulation across two factors: mode of engagement - active motor entrainment (finger tapping) versus passive listening, and groove level - low versus high. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were used to assess SMN activity, with a focus on mu rhythm modulation in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Channel and cluster-based EEG analyses revealed stronger mu suppression during active tapping compared to passive listening, as well as an effect of musical groove. Self-reported groove ratings were not affected by the tapping task. Together, these findings highlight the modulation of the mu rhythm in the SMN, describing distinctive patterns of neural engagement during the experience of musical groove.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Conventional interventions, such as revascularization, have had limited success in reversing muscle pathology or preventing adverse outcomes like amputation. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are key regulators of cellular responses to ischemia, including the promotion of angiogenesis and glycolysis. While pharmacological stabilization of HIF proteins represents a promising therapeutic strategy, its efficacy is diminished in aged muscles due to their intrinsically low basal HIF expression. We hypothesized that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) might enhance the hypoxic response in aged muscle through post-transcriptional regulation of HIF expression. Our study identified Neat1, a long noncoding RNA, as a critical mediator of the hypoxia-induced stress response, including upregulation of Hif1alpha;. In a murine hindlimb ischemia model, Neat1 knockout mice exhibited extensive necrosis following femoral artery ligation, whereas Neat1 overexpression conferred protection against ischemic injury. Mechanistically, we found that Neat1 regulates the stability of Hif1a mRNA, as Hif1a transcript levels were significantly reduced in Neat1-deficient muscle cells. Importantly, aged muscles displayed a blunted hypoxic response due to diminished Hif1a expression, an effect that was reversed through Neat1 overexpression, resulting in improved resistance to ischemic damage. In summary, our findings highlight Neat1 as a novel regulator of muscle adaptation to hypoxia in aging. Enhancing Neat1 expression may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for improving ischemic outcomes in patients with peripheral artery disease.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that bi-directional mitochondrial trafficking between cells harbouring import-defective and import-competent mitochondria has distinct regulation and consequences. Transferred import-defective mitochondria are highly fragmented and destined for canonical lysosomal degradation. In contrast, ROS-producing mitochondria at the periphery of cells with import-competent mitochondria are transferred into neighbouring cells undergoing import failure; these new arrivals then accumulate within previously uncharacterised 'mitochondrial degradation bodies' (MBDs).

Recent studies have extended the hypothesis to include the fact that these natural enemies often attack phylogenetically related species as well, which reduces diversity and hence the explanatory power of the hypothesis. However, these studies consider ecological time scales at which the phylogenetic relatedness between species is constant, and thus ignore that at evolutionary time scales the population dynamics change the phylogeny. We use a spatially explicit eco-evolutionary model of the interplay between the dynamics of the phylogeny and the species abundances to study the predictions for common macroevolutionary and macroecological patterns. We confirm that hyperdiversity can be maintained by the J-C effect but the phylogenetic relatedness effect weakens the rarity advantage, reducing diversity. Incorporating protracted speciation further improves the result. Our model predicts a triphasic species-area relationship at much shorter time scales than in neutral scenarios. The species-abundance distribution can have one or two modes depending on the dispersal distance. Phylogenetic trees show diversification slowdowns and imbalance, consistent with empirical patterns. We study a new pattern of phylogenetic relatedness through space and find that small dispersal distance causes clusters of species with large phylogenetic distance to the community while large dispersal distance makes species distribute uniformly. As an illustration of how our model's predictions can be compared to empirical data we study macroecological and phylogenetic patterns of the Barro Colorado Island (BCI) tree community. We conclude that the spatially explicit eco-evolutionary phylogenetic J-C effect can explain commonly observed macroevolutionary and macroecological patterns, providing an alternative way, while the traditional methods are prone, to demonstrate the role of J-C effect on species community assembly.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

HEIMDALL further shows how existing strategies can be recombined to enhance generalization. By standardizing evaluation and providing an extensive library, HEIMDALL establishes a foundation for reproducible, systematic exploration of single-cell tokenization and accelerates the development of next-generation scFMs.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Although recent spatial transcriptomics and multiplex imaging technologies offer fine-grained insights into the TME, their high cost and lengthy turnaround times limit routine clinical use. In contrast, whole slide images (WSIs) of Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained are readily available for most patients and provide valuable information about tumor biology. Here, we present a method that explicitly models each cell's local neighborhood to identify recurrent spatial patterns, which we call \"Star-Motifs.\" We first encode the local microenvironment of each cell using a \"Star-Environment\" representation that captures distances and angles to multiple surrounding cell types. We then perform unsupervised clustering of these descriptors to discover distinct Star-Motifs. We validated our method on 1.8 billion cells across 3,105 diagnostic slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas, spanning five distinct cell types: neoplastic, inflammatory, stromal, necrotic, and non-neoplastic. Our method uncovered a diverse range of Star-Motifs, from densely packed tumor clusters to tumor cells surrounded by immune cells (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes). At the patient level, the relative abundances of these Star-Motifs correlate with patient survival outcomes, immune subtypes, and molecular alterations, offering interpretable, clinically relevant insights. Moreover, classical machine learning models trained on these abundances match or surpass deep learning approaches in predicting overall survival and immune-related biomarkers while remaining interpretable. By capturing higher-order spatial arrangements from routinely available histology slides, Star-Motifs provides a scalable, transparent platform for TME profiling, biomarker discovery, and personalized risk assessment in oncology.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

E.; Sonneborn, A.; Shotwell, S. L.; Janowsky, A.; Abbas, A.; Torralva, R.", "abstract": "Fentanyl leads to tens of thousands of overdose deaths every year despite widespread availability of naloxone. Like other opioids, fentanyl causes respiratory depression. Unlike morphine, high dose fentanyl rapidly produces airway obstruction, muscle rigidity, and cardiovascular failure. Using a rat model of opioid overdose, we compared the physiological effects of fentanyl and morphine and studied the efficacy of a novel rescue strategy. In contrast to morphine, we report that fentanyl more frequently causes respiratory failure secondary to vocal cord closure and leads to more severe cardiovascular disruption, including the blockade of baroreflex-like rebound in blood pressure. We also show that administration of intramuscular naloxone immediately after intravenous infusion of fentanyl did not improve survival. However, combining intramuscular naloxone with the alpha-2 adrenergic agonist clonidine rescued vocal cord function and stabilized cardiovascular and respiratory physiology from fentanyl-induced effects. Our findings demonstrate that fentanyl is associated with a unique and more severe toxidrome compared to morphine. Also, supplementing naloxone with drugs targeting the adrenergic system improves survival primarily by reopening the upper airway, implicating airway obstruction as a significant component of fentanyl-induced respiratory depression. Therefore, reversal of vocal cord closure appears to be the necessary precursor to the restoration of not only respiration, but also vascular autoregulation, a significant determinant of survival from fentanyl overdose", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the role of FT1, the barley homolog of the florigen FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), in regulating source (leaf) and sink (inflorescence) development and metabolism. Using ft1 knock-out mutants in the spring barley cultivar Golden Promise, which carries a mutated ppd-H1 allele, and in an introgression line with a wild-type Ppd-H1 allele, we show that Ppd-H1 primarily regulates the timing of inflorescence development and flowering through FT1, whereas variation in tiller number and leaf size is determined by the genetic background. ft1 mutants exhibited reduced determinacy of both leaf and inflorescence meristems, resulting in increased leaf and spikelet numbers and size, but severely reduced inflorescence fertility, altered senescence patterns, and significantly extended plant longevity. The ft1 mutants exhibited a strong transcriptional reprogramming of genes involved in both the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis in the leaf, alongside an upregulation of genes associated with carbon catabolism and stress responses in the leaf and inflorescence. Elevated soluble sugar and starch levels in ft1 inflorescences indicated that the impaired development and fertility of ft1 inflorescences were not caused by carbon limitation, but instead reflected a reduced sink strength. Our work reveals that FT1 coordinates the development of vegetative and reproductive meristems and organs with plant physiology and metabolism, thereby regulating source-sink relationships and balancing plant longevity with reproductive output.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Overlapping genes allow multiple proteins to be encoded from a single DNA sequence, including convergent (antisense; tail-to-tail) orientations across three reading frames (phases 0, 1, and 2), with phase 1 most frequently observed in nature. Designing such overlaps is challenging due to codon degeneracy, phase-specific biases, and the need to preserve structural integrity for both proteins. Here, a purpose-built transformer encoder is introduced, trained on a balanced synthetic dataset of convergent overlaps spanning diverse prokaryotic genomes and GC contents. Controlled amino acid substitutions were incorporated during training to enhance model generalization, particularly for phase 1 overlaps. At inference, Monte Carlo dropout enabled uncertainty-aware sampling of synonymous codon solutions, which were iteratively refined using a windowed, multi-objective optimization framework. Candidate overlaps were scored using composite weighting across secondary structure preservation, substitution similarity, alignment identity, and ESM-2 contact map similarity, with SSIM applied as a rapid proxy for structural fidelity. This approach generated convergent overlaps across all phases, with phase 1 showing the highest success rates. Optimization trajectories revealed distinct dynamics, with secondary structure preservation steadily increasing despite its lower weight. External validation using SwissProt proteins stratified by AlphaFold2 pLDDT confidence supported generalization to proteins with differing rigidity, yielding high secondary structure preservation in silico. These results demonstrate that transformer models trained directly at the nucleotide level, when coupled with uncertainty-aware inference and lightweight structural proxies, can support the computational design of synthetic overlapping genes without requiring full structural prediction. This framework offers a scalable path for phase-specific, codon-aware overlap design under realistic constraints.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

We compared 6-7-year-old (N = 15) children and adults (N = 16) during a naturalistic 5-minute co-creative dialogue with ChatGPT using the same prompt, in-scanner conversation, undergoing functional MRI scanning and their dialogues were recorded. Functional connectivity (Fisher's z) was computed within and between seven large-scale networks: cingulo-opercular, default mode (DMN), memory retrieval, frontoparietal (FP), salience, ventral attention (VAN), and dorsal attention (DAN). Creativity scores, assessed outside of the scanner, did not differ between groups. Adults showed stronger within-network connectivity in control/attention systems, most robustly in FP, with additional effects in salience and DAN. Adults also exhibited greater cross-network integration, particularly FP-salience and FP-DAN couplings, alongside broader adult-greater effects among memory- and attention-related pairs. During a co-creative AI-assisted conversation, children exhibit a less coherent and integrated control-attention-memory architecture than adults. The combination of similar creativity scores with divergent neural profiles suggests that developmental differences in the implementation of creative cognition may be more pronounced than baseline capacity.

However, characterization of potential developmental changes, and possible differences along lateral line position are lacking. Here, we used in vivo patch clamp to investigate the electrophysiological and exocytic properties of neuromast hair cells over early development across body location. Long depolarizations led to steady increases in membrane capacitance, presumably due to exocytosis of vesicles localized to ribbon synapses. The magnitude and kinetics of capacitance changes did not vary significantly across the L1 to L6 position of neuromasts along lateral line, but the magnitudes were found to be significantly smaller in hair cells found in the tail region across all developmental time points. For each region, we found no significant changes in capacitance responses between 3 and 7 days after fertilization. Hair cell capacitance responses were greatly reduced in animals injected with CRISPR/Cas9 with gRNAs targeted to otoferlin b. These results confirm the essential role of otoferlin b in neuromast hair cell function, and they establish the fidelity of CRISPR/Cas9 to rapidly mediate genetic removal of critical genes to study their impact on synaptic release.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Experimental studies have shown that severe and chronic stress can disrupt reproductive function, but the effects of mild stress, more representative of the daily stress experienced by most women, are still poorly understood. This study aims to identify how mild stress affects the mouse estrous cycle. Nineteen mice were vaginally lavaged daily one week before stress, during 3-day stress, and one week after stress. The mild stress paradigm consisted of two hours of repeated restraint stress each day for three days. Restraint stress disrupted the estrous cycle causing a longer cycle length in stressed mice, characterized by an extended duration in the diestrus phase. These findings suggest that even moderate stress perturbs normal reproductive cycling, potentially contributing to reduced fertility.

Specifically, di-synaptic motifs like reciprocal, convergent, divergent, and chain are found to be either over-represented or under-represented in certain brain regions. Over-representation of such motifs among excitatory neurons is known to induce synchrony. However, cortical activity is typically asynchronous. Thus, it remains unclear how synchrony induced by excitatory motifs may be reduced to physiological levels. To address this question, we systematically vary the prevalence of these four motifs in an Excitatory-Inhibitory (EI) network. We found that over-representation of chain and convergent motifs in the excitatory population led to increased firing rates and greater synchrony. However, this excess synchrony was quenched when we introduced the same type of motifs among inhibitory neurons. Because of the overabundance of motifs, some inhibitory neurons received fewer recurrent inhibitory inputs. Such weakly coupled neurons were primarily driven by uncorrelated external inputs, and therefore, these neurons exerted stronger inhibition on excitatory neurons and reduced both synchrony and firing rates. Thus, we also provide a new mechanism by which synchrony can be controlled in excitatory-inhibitory networks. We predict that the same kind of di-synaptic motifs should be present in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

The parasite utilizes a specialized double-membraned organelle, called the inner membrane complex for schizont-stage segmentation and merozoite motility during subsequent re-invasion. In this study, we investigate the function of IMC55, a multi-transmembrane inner membrane complex protein, which we identified as a putative interacting partner of the P. falciparum ER-resident calcium binding protein, PfERC. We have previously shown that PfERC is essential for parasite egress and our data shows that PfERC may also function in parasite invasion into the RBC. The whole genome transposon mutagenesis screen predicts that IMC55 is essential for the intra-erythrocytic asexual cycle. In this work, we show that IMC55 is not required for asexual replication. Following inducible expression of this gene using two conditional systems, we find there is no defect in replicative fitness during the asexual blood stage.

We hypothesized that frog species with auditory system reductions have compensated through enhanced visual ability, including through enlarged eyes. To test this trade-off hypothesis, we estimated relative eye and corneal investment across 264 species and tested for correlations with auditory reduction. Contrary to our expectations, we found that species with auditory reductions had smaller eye size and lower eye investment. Instead, we found that non-fossorial species with auditory reductions had significantly greater corneal investment, after controlling for habitat-based variation. Enlarged corneas enhance light sensitivity but are expected to have a lower metabolic cost than larger eyes. Relatively larger corneas may, in combination with other changes, allow frogs with auditory reductions to rely more on vision for communication, while at the same time minimizing energetic costs in small animals that are already metabolically constrained. Our findings suggest that the visual system plays an adaptive role in response to the reduction of auditory communication and highlights the condition of sensory systems as an important factor shaping frog evolution.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Robust adhesion requires cis dimerization between neighboring Ecads on the cell surface and previous structural and biophysical studies have proposed conflicting models on the role of specific and nonspecific interactions in mediating cis dimerization. However, since these studies were carried out with isolated Ecad extracellular regions in cell-free systems, it is unknown if specific and nonspecific cis binding modes also occur with transmembrane Ecads in live cells, and if specific and nonspecific cis dimers recruit different sets of cytoplasmic proteins to Ecad junctions. To directly address these knowledge gaps, we developed a Dimerization Activated TuboID (DAT) proximity labeling system that reports on different modes of Ecad cis binding and their corresponding proteomes. Using DAT, fluorescence measurements, diffusion-reaction simulations, and adhesion assays, we demonstrate that Ecads in live cells form cis dimers via both specific and non-specific interactions and that cis dimerization does not require either prior trans contacts or an intact actin cytoskeleton. However, we show that the loss of specific cis interactions results in increased junctional instability and Ecad mobility, which leads to dysregulated peripheral protein interactions without affecting recruitment of core junctional proteins.

L.; Bentz, E. J.; Mason, R. T.", "abstract": "Balancing survival and reproduction presents a fundamental evolutionary challenge, especially in extreme and unpredictable environments. Thermoregulatory behavior in particular imposes a costly trade-off, as time spent maintaining optimal body temperature precludes other essential activities and forces individuals to balance competing selective pressures. By combining field observations, behavioral assays, and gene expression profiling of red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis), we describe how an ectothermic vertebrate navigates this trade-off in an extreme thermal environment through a combination of finely tuned mechanisms of behavioral and physiological plasticity. Snakes demonstrated remarkably consistent critical thermal limits, with minimal individual variation, suggesting a hard physiological constraint. Importantly, behavioral temperature thresholds for voluntary withdrawal and courtship cessation occurred within 5 {degrees}C of lethal, demonstrating that males routinely operate perilously close to lethal body temperatures in order to maximize reproductive opportunities. Context-dependent plasticity allows males to prioritize mating opportunities over thermoregulation until survival becomes an immediate threat. Molecular analyses of multiple tissues revealed rapid, tissue-specific transcriptomic responses activated within one hour of thermal challenge, well before critical limits were reached. Heat shock proteins were universally upregulated across all tissues under both heat and cold stress, suggesting anticipatory protective mechanisms that support risky behavioral decisions rather than simply responding to thermal damage. Tissue-specific patterns of gene expression reflected functional priorities with liver showing extensive metabolic flexibility, heart maintaining conservative stability, while brain and testis appeared to balance critical functions with stress responses. These findings demonstrate precise thermal reaction norms that integrate behavioral and molecular plasticity to maximize reproductive effort without compromising survival. The narrow margin between behavioral thresholds and lethal limits suggests this system may already be approaching evolutionary constraints. While phenotypic plasticity currently buffers populations against extreme thermal variability, it may paradoxically limit long-term adaptive potential as increasing environmental temperatures further narrow safety margins. Precise thermal decision-making, rapid physiological responses, and context-dependent behavioral switching suggest an evolved solution to the problem of balancing competing selective pressures.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Microglia play a complex role in post-stroke pathology, contributing both to repair and secondary injury. How short-term depletion during the subacute phase affects functional recovery remains unknown. METHODS: Wild-type mice were trained in a skilled reaching task and underwent permanent distal medial cerebral artery occlusion or sham intervention. Mice received either a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor or vehicle treatment between days 3 and 7 post-stroke to deplete microglia. Fine motor performance was assessed behaviorally while bilateral cortical activity was recorded longitudinally through epidural electrocorticography. RESULTS: Microglia depletion did not affect infarct size but resulted in near-complete restoration of fine motor function by day 7, coinciding with maximal microglial depletion. Recovery of fine motor function was accompanied by significant functional connectivity changes in bilateral sensorimotor networks, including increased beta-band connectivity in the ipsilesional motor cortex, which correlated with contralateral fine motor improvement. After microglial repopulation, cells showed altered morphology and gene expression profiles.

Importantly, sympathetic sprouting was consistently more pronounced after transection injuries at both spinal and sciatic nerve sites, suggesting that injury type, rather than location, is a dominant factor shaping sympathetic remodeling. These findings establish nerve transection as a key driver of sympathetic sprouting and SMP, whereas crush-induced pain likely involves distinct non-sympathetic mechanisms. This distinction has important implications for pain subtype identification and treatment strategies.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

However, there is a limited understanding of how HERV-K is trafficked in peripheral biofluids, and the role of exosomes, which are nano sized extracellular vesicles, in this process remains largely unexplored. Exosomes offer a stable and cell-specific cargo reservoir that may reflect central pathogenic processes and serve as a minimally invasive biomarker source. In this study, we isolated plasma-derived exosomes from ALS patients (n = 21) and healthy controls (n = 16), and quantified exosomal HERV-K gag, env, and pol transcript levels using SYBR Green qPCR with RNase treatment and normalization to both traditional and exosome enriched reference genes. HERV K pol expression was significantly elevated in ALS, with fold-changes ranging from 1.59 to 1.85 (P = 0.037 to 0.051). env and gag also showed increased expression, though with greater variability. Normalization to the exosome-specific gene SOD2 provided the most consistent signal. A trend toward higher pol expression in bulbar-onset ALS was observed. These findings suggest that exosomal HERV-K transcripts, particularly pol, could serve as accessible biomarkers for patient stratification and treatment monitoring in HERV K targeted ALS trials. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for using exosomal cargo to track endogenous retroviral activity in neurodegeneration, supporting further investigation of liquid biopsy approaches in ALS precision medicine.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Background: Neurons in the oval subnucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (ovBNST) integrate stress and reward signals to regulate motivated behaviors, including food consumption. However, the contribution of specific ovBNST neuronal subpopulations remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 (Vipr2) expressing ovBNST neurons using chemogenetics, immunohistochemistry, and viral circuit mapping. Methods and Results: Using stimulatory hM3Dq designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs), we found that chemogenetic activation of ovBNST Vipr2 neurons significantly increased food intake. We then quantified cFos activation in Vipr2-tdTomato reporter mice following several unique feeding-related manipulations, finding that food restriction (FR) robustly activated ovBNST Vipr2 neurons. Further analysis revealed decreased vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) innervation of the ovBNST following FR, in which reduced VIP expression was significantly associated with greater ovBNST Vipr2 cFos activation. Given previous reports of reduced food intake following stimulation of ovBNST neurons expressing protein kinase C delta (PKC{delta}), we used immunostaining to uncover that Vipr2 and PKC{delta} mark largely non-overlapping ovBNST neuronal subpopulations, aligning with their opposing effects on food intake. Finally, Cre-dependent anterograde viral tracing revealed that ovBNST Vipr2 neurons project prominently to the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN) and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN), two feeding-related regions. Conclusions: Together, these results identify ovBNST Vipr2 neurons as a functionally distinct BNST subpopulation that promotes feeding, is activated by food restriction, and links ovBNST neuropeptide signaling to hypothalamic feeding centers.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Hydra has a simple body plan consisting of two epithelial monolayers separated by an extracellular matrix (ECM). This ECM contains conserved components such as collagen and laminin, making Hydra well suited for dissecting ECM function during regeneration. Following head amputation and wound closure, we observe a retraction of ECM proteins from the wound site, creating a region of low ECM protein accumulation that persists for several days during head regeneration. Several matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) genes are expressed during this process, and MMP inhibition reduces the size of the ECM gap and results in a regenerative outcome with gross morphological defects. We further find that interstitial stem cells (ISCs), which originate in the ectoderm, localize in the regenerating head endoderm near regions of reduced ECM. This suggests that the ECM gap facilitates stem cell invasion to populate the new head with neurons and gland cells. However, inhibition of collagen cross-linking reveals that collagen synthesis is also required for regeneration, indicating that Hydra must balance ECM degradation and synthesis to complete regeneration. Together, these findings highlight ECM remodeling as a critical and conserved feature of regeneration.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Here we present CellHermes, a biological language model that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs) to integrate multimodal forms of omics data, such as transcriptomic profile and PPI network, through natural language for better omics understanding. By reformulating these datasets into question-answer pairs, CellHermes emulates multiple self-supervised learning paradigms within a single, universal, language-based framework with LORA fine-tuning on existing natural language-LLM, achieving comparable or even better performance compared to current single-cell foundation models trained from scratch. Within this framework, CellHermes functions as an encoder, a predictor and an explainer for supporting a range of downstream tasks. For encoder, CellHermes encodes biological entities with embeddings that enable accurate network discovery and cross-dataset generalization; For predictor, CellHermes unifies heterogeneous downstream tasks by translating them into natural language question-answers pairs, allowing a single model to perform multi-task prediction by instruction fine-tuning; For explainer, CellHermes explains molecular mechanisms by combining attention analysis with text-based reasoning, leveraging the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We evaluated the ability of CellHermes as an encoder on representing genes and cells using 5 gene-level downstream tasks and 5 diverse single-cell datasets across different tissues compared with other single cell foundation models. We also evaluated CellHermes as a predictor on BioUniBench, a new benchmark of 10 tasks across 7 databases for LLMs, including perturbation response, cell fitness estimation, gene-disease association, and cell type identification. All benchmarks suggest CellHermes can unify multiple biological tasks within one model without compromising performance. By applying CellHermes as an explainer for a melanoma patients dataset, it can uncover potential key genes on tumor-reactive T cells. Together, CellHermes establishes natural language as a unifying medium for omics, offering a foundation that, in the future, potentially enables a more integrated and interpretable research loop of biological representation, prediction, and interpretability.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Conjugation of proteins with gold nanoparticles (GNPs) is crucial in developing nanoparticle-based drugs, which are used in making targeted delivery systems for therapeutic and diagnostic use. This conjugation is often mediated by covalent gold thiol (Au,S) bonds involving cysteine residues. However, the influence of other interactions, like electrostatics, on protein-GNP interactions remains poorly understood. While the independent roles of cysteine (thiol interactions) and lysine (electrostatics) are studied, how these two distinct mechanisms couple and mutually influence one another remains unknown. It is particularly unclear how the position and the electrostatics around cysteine residues within the protein structure modulate their interaction with GNPs. Hence, to isolate the electrostatic contribution from Au-S interaction, we systematically investigated the role of positively charged lysine in protein interaction with citrate-capped GNPs using protein L, a cysteine-free antibody-binding protein. Protein L has seven lysine residues, positively charged at pH 7.4. Each lysine was individually mutated to cysteine to create single-cysteine variants. The capping strength of these mutants on citrate-capped GNPs was assessed using various biophysical techniques. Surprisingly, not all cysteine mutants formed stable covalent conjugates. The K7C mutant, in particular, showed strong and irreversible GNP capping, not solely due to the introduced cysteine, but also because of nearby positively charged residues that promoted electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged citrate-capped GNP surface. This critical role of electrostatics was further confirmed using lysine acrylation, which effectively capped lysines and prevented their interaction. Our experimental plan was thus able to successfully decouple the contributions of Au-S bonding from lysine-driven electrostatics. These sequential and cooperative studies underscore that electrostatic and covalent factors are not independent but part of an interconnected process, thereby underscoring the need to consider local charge environments in protein engineering for nanoparticle conjugation.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Monosynaptic rabies tracing is the gold standard method to study circuit architecture. However, it suffers from cellular toxicity, low throughput, lack of control over the timing of labeling, and the inability to access the molecular profiles of individual neurons. To address these issues, we developed an inducible barcoded rabies virus (ibRV) to enable temporal-controlled labeling of synaptic circuits followed by high-throughput single-cell genomics readout. ibRV allows for dissecting neuronal circuit changes over time at single-cell and spatial resolution. We applied ibRV to study the development of specific mouse cortical circuits during late prenatal and postnatal life using single-cell genomics and unbiased spatial transcriptomics as readouts.

However, when disassembly fails, stress granules can persist and solidify. While stress granule solidification has been well documented, the cellular mechanisms underlying the transition from reversible to persistent stress granules remain unclear. Persistent stress granules can seed the formation of pathological aggregates, such as TDP-43 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Although amyloid-{beta} and tau aggregates are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, a subset of patients also develop TDP-43 deposits, suggesting a possible role for stress granule solidification in Alzheimer's disease progression. Despite theoretical models explaining why persistence and ensuing solidification occurs, strong in vivo evidence is lacking. Here we show that competition for limited chaperone resources drive stress granule persistence. In the presence of TDP-43 aggregates or yeast amyloid proteins called prions, stress granule disassembly is slowed or halted disassembly. Using yeast prions as a model, we show that the addition of chaperones, specifically the AAA+ ATPase molecular chaperone, Hsp104, resulted in resumption of stress granule disassembly. Our results demonstrate that the competition for shared resources, such as molecular chaperones, can limit stress granule disassembly. We suspect that the presence of pathological aggregates results in resource competition within the aging brain, contributing to the persistence of stress granules and their subsequent solidification and aggregation.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

In animals, these micro and nanoplastics are recognized as particulate materials and thus handled by macrophages, either directly in the case of lung exposure, or after the particles have crossed the epithelial barriers in case of oral or dermal exposure. It is thus important to study the potential effects of micro and nanoplastics on macrophages. Most studies have used an experimental scheme in which the cells of interest are exposed to a single dose of plastics, and where the readout of the studied parameters is made immediately after exposure. However, this classical experimental scheme does not take into account the impact of biopersistence, nor the potential cellular adaptation that may take place when cells are exposed repeatedly to a low dose of plastics. We thus used a repeated exposure scheme, in order to better take into account these phenomena.

Our results show that under this repeated exposure scheme, the proteome changes were of a lesser extent than under the acute exposure mode, indicating cell adaptation.

Early completion of planning would allow for a smooth and economical movement; however, it also requires sufficiently accurate information about the object's movement to be available earlier. We investigate interception in the context of a complex, naturalistic motor task, toss juggling, to understand the extent to which proprioceptive and tactile information influence anticipatory movements of the catching hand. In our study, we compared solo juggling, where the efferent, tactile and proprioceptive information from the throwing hand is available during catch planning, with dyadic juggling, a functionally ''deafferented'' condition where no such information is available because the ball has been thrown by another person. Our results indicate that when internal and tactile information from the toss is absent, anticipatory behavior is greatly reduced.

IRF7 knockdown reduced ISG15 expression, whereas ISG15 knockdown did not affect IRF7, suggesting a unidirectional regulatory relationship. Conditioned media from microglia treated with siIRF7 or siISG15 increased SY5Y cell mortality, with a stronger effect in the siISG15 group, highlighting neuroprotective role of ISG15. ISG15 knockdown also enhanced microglial migration. Conversely, microglial ISG15 overexpression in vivo promoted a shift toward reduced neuroinflammation, improved neuronal survival, and enhanced functional recovery. Mechanistically, ISG15 stabilized NLRP3 protein but more strongly decreased its mRNA stability through accelerated degradation. These findings demonstrate that the activation of IRF7/ISG15 axis in microglia inhibits NLRP3 Expression and improve the prognosis of ischemia/reperfusion in mice, with ISG15 exerting stronger neuroprotective effects. Targeting microglial ISG15 may offer a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Truncating mutations in RELA, encoding the NF-{kappa}B subunit p65, have been linked to autoinflammation and autoimmunity, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely defined. We investigated six patients from five unrelated families carrying novel heterozygous truncating RELA variants. Despite reduced p65 expression, patients exhibited a broad spectrum of inflammatory manifestations alongside elevated baseline and stimulus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines. Functional analyses in patient-derived cells and mutant RELA knock-in models showed that upstream NF-{kappa}B signaling was intact, but induction of inhibitory regulators such as I{kappa}B and A20 was impaired. This defective feedback control shifted immune homeostasis toward amplified inflammatory responses that depended on the residual activity of the remaining functional RELA allele. Single-cell transcriptomics revealed distinct cell type-specific consequences: monocytes displayed constitutive type I interferon and NF-{kappa}B activation, B cells retained partial compensatory signaling, whereas T and NK cells exhibited transcriptional signatures of cell death pathways. Patient fibroblasts and mutant RELA knock-in cells further confirmed enhanced TNF-induced inflammatory gene expression and hypersensitivity to apoptosis and necroptosis. These findings establish RELA haploinsufficiency as a cause of systemic immune dysregulation, and link defective NF-{kappa}B feedback control to unchecked inflammation and inflammatory cell death.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Prior transcriptomic studies relied on disaggregated tissue, which causes cell loss and induction. We applied spatial transcriptomics to investigate synovial lining and sublining fibroblasts and macrophages from RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Methods: Fresh frozen synovial tissues from 7 RA and 8 OA patients were analyzed using the NanoString GeoMX DSP Whole Transcriptome Assay. Lining and sublining regions were segmented into fibroblasts and macrophages. Principal component analysis separated samples by cell type and disease. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were analyzed by linear mixed models (p-value<0.05 and |log2 fold change|>0.5) and Reactome pathway (FDR<0.02) analysis. Results: DEG analysis of RA compared to OA revealed distinct gene signatures across regions and cell types. RA lining fibroblasts exhibited a strong pro-inflammatory and matrix-destructive signature, while RA sublining fibroblasts showed an unexpected role in antigen presentation and adaptive immunity. RA lining macrophages exhibited enrichment for interleukin signaling, extracellular matrix organization, and translation-related pathways. In contrast, sublining macrophages showed minimal transcriptional differences between RA and OA, suggesting limited pathogenic involvement. Comparison between lining and sublining within RA showed that lining fibroblasts display a higher activated phenotype than sublining cells. Conclusion: Spatial transcriptomic analysis uncovers distinct region- and cell-type-specific transcriptional profiles in RA synovium. Lining fibroblasts are highly activated and destructive, and sublining fibroblasts contribute surprisingly to adaptive immunity. This data provides clues to region-cell-type-specific functions that could be exploited to identify novel therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

However, studies of human gastric mucus have been limited due to poor accessibility of native human mucus and the abundance of contaminants in these samples. Here, we explored the potential of human gastric organoids as models for mucus production. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that the organoids produced mucus containing MUC5AC and MUC6. The luminal mucus had viscoelastic properties similar to those of native human gastric mucus, as determined by particle tracking microrheology. To collect organoid-produced gastric mucus, termed bioengineered gastric mucus (BGM), organoids were cultured as monolayers at the air-liquid interface (ALI), and apically-secreted mucus was harvested and analyzed by MUC5AC ELISA, proteomics, CryoFE-SEM, and bulk rheometry. BGM contained high-molecular weight molecules also found in native gastric mucus, including MUC5AC. Proteomic analysis confirmed that BGM contained MUC5AC, MUC6, MUC1, and other stomach-specific molecules such as gastricsin, olfactomedin 4, and gastrokine. CryoFE-SEM showed that both BGM and native mucus had a porous structure and a characteristic honeycomb scaffold. Bulk rheometry confirmed that BGM exhibited shear thinning and predominantly elastic behavior, consistent with native mucus. Collectively, these findings indicate that BGM is an accessible alternative to native gastric mucus that can be produced on-demand for in vitro studies.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Structured expert elicitation is often used to generate these estimates, but comparisons of these expert-predicted outcomes with observed results are rare. This study aims to evaluate the utility of expert elicitation for adaptive management in the New South Wales Saving our Species (SoS) program in Australia by revisiting six species management plans that were generated from bespoke structured elicitation guidelines five years prior. Each species' management plan included a defined scope, conceptual model, monitoring indicators and estimated response to management curves under different scenarios. Experts reviewed the conceptual models after five years of management and monitoring and compared the predicted response to management with observed monitoring data. In three of the six case studies, observed outcomes closely matched predictions. Where predictions diverged, factors such as unanticipated new threats and unexpected responses to interventions contributed to discrepancies. However, in all cases, the structured approach provided a clear logic for planning, enabling managers to refine systematically their understanding. The conceptual models and response curves proved valuable for collaboration, communication, and generating hypotheses for unexpected results.

Species with diverse parental care patterns often exhibit flexibility in response to environmental changes. Such changes can influence parental care decisions by altering the trade-offs between current and future reproduction. While previous studies have revealed correlations between specific social and ecological factors and parental care patterns, the joint effects of multiple factors could be rather complex and may result in different outcomes within and across populations, and between sexes. 2. In this study, we revealed parental care systems and their seasonal variations across three geographic populations in a polygamous species, the Chinese penduline tits (Remiz consobrinus), by monitoring breeding events over years. To investigate how local conditions (including social and ecological conditions) correlate with sex-specific parental care patterns, we compared breeding phenology and local conditions (including season length, mating opportunity and reproductive success) across the populations. 3. Striking population differences in parental care strategies are found in this species: biparental care predominated in one population, whereas female-only care was more common in the other two. Our analyses reveal that, despite a large difference in season length, the time of egg-laying peaked similarly across the three populations. Female penduline tits determined the breeding phenology, which varies male mating opportunities dramatically over the season. For all populations, male Chinese penduline tits were more likely to desert the clutch when male mating opportunities were high. In contrast, females consistently provided care, regardless of variation in female mating opportunities. 4. We also found that fitness costs on the current brood resulting from offspring desertion differed across populations. This desertion cost on brood fitness matters more than achieving a high reproductive reward in driving the emergence of uniparental care, contrary to the theory that uniparental care only occurs when single parents can efficiently raise nestlings alone. 5. Our study demonstrates that similar parental care patterns across populations could result from different underlying factor interactions and highlights the consistent sex-specific responses to local conditions in parental care.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

However, if species regularly move across distances greater than those between patches, the effect of distance may approach zero. More studies of highly mobile species such as vesper bats (Vespertilionidae) are needed to clarify how such species respond to fragmentation. This study examines the impact of forest fragmentation on vesper bat community diversity in the Southeastern United States. Using mobile acoustic surveys, bats were monitored along forest transects in the Cherokee National Forest and in surrounding farmlands containing widely spaced forest fragments. The same nine vesper bat species were recorded and identified in both habitat types. Results indicate a 43% decline in vesper bat abundance in the farmland when compared to intact forest, with eight species having a higher abundance within the intact forest. Notably, Seminole bats, (Lasiurus seminolus) maintained similar abundance across habitats, suggesting species-specific responses to fragmentation. Despite identical species richness, diversity indices such as the Shannon diversity index and {beta}Shannon identified lower biodiversity in the farmland when compared to the forest. Our results indicate that despite being highly mobile, vesper bats exhibit a largely negative response to habitat fragmentation and loss. This could be due to the change of the core to edge habitat ratio, emphasizing the importance of conserving core forest habitat to sustain bat biodiversity. Observed species-specific responses to habitat fragmentation indicate a need for further research to elucidate the complexities of managing bat communities in human-modified ecosystems.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

However, the source of this length variation is unknown. We established a genetically tractable experimental system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the mechanism of instability in the RS3 microsatellite. We successfully recapitulated the full spectrum of the RS3 length polymorphism observed in humans and found that it results from genetic recombination between RS3 sequences. Ultimately, we conclude that R-loop associated genome instability elevates recombination rate and triggers repair via single strand annealing which can result in microsatellite length polymorphism.

Our analysis revealed a highly diverse genome structure, with multiple phylogenetic groups showing distinct associations with commensalism or pathogenicity. We observed extensive variation in mobile genetic elements, prophages, and AMR genes, alongside increased carriage of plasmids and AMR genes over time.

It was hypothesized that the behaviors would change over time. With Duke IACUC approval, Pelco IMM12027-1S cameras were placed in the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) aye-aye mother's enclosure to record her activity. Over three days peripartum, full 24-hour footage and continuous focal animal sampling were used to note the time, duration, and type of repetitive scratching, grooming, etc. Data were then analyzed using Chi-square, Fishers Exact, and Kruskal Wallis tests. The results showed that the day before birth, the mother repeatedly constructed and deconstructed nests eight times more than engaging in any other behavior (n=212x), while on the day of birth, the mother scratched (n=87x) and groomed (n=60x) herself a lot. The day after birth, the mother was hyper-vigilant (n=32x). Thus, the hypothesis was supported as the mother exhibited signs of anxiety by engaging in different anxiety-related behaviors over the three-day period. While limitations such as a small sample size (n=1) and possible abnormal parturition behavior are evident, this study is the first to examine maternal anxiety in aye-ayes.

In this study, we address this paradox of glassy dynamics in epithelial cells by integrating experimental observations with an active vertex model. We demonstrate that while crowding is essential, but not sufficient for glassy dynamics to emerge. A mechanochemical feedback loop (MCFL), mediated by cell shape changes through the contractile actomyosin network, is also required to drive glass transition in dense epithelial tissues, as revealed via a crosstalk between actin-based cell clustering and dynamic heterogeneity in experiments. Incorporating MCFL into the vertex model reveals that glassy dynamics can emerge even at high cellular activity if the strength of the MCFL remains high. We show that the MCFL can counteract cell division-induced fluidisation and enable glassy dynamics to emerge through active cell-to-cell communication. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the existence of novel collective mechanochemical oscillations that arise from the crosstalk of two MCFLs. Together, we demonstrate that an interplay between crowding and active mechanochemical feedback enables the emergence of glass-like traits and collective biochemical oscillations in epithelial tissues with active cell-cell contacts.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Methods: Twenty-eight collegiate womens basketball athletes were randomly allocated to 90%, 80%, or 70% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) back-squat groups, or a control group. Athletes completed 3x3 parallel back squats, after which countermovement jump (CMJ), single-leg and double-leg approach-jump heights were assessed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 min. CMJ kinetics--peak power output, vertical ground-reaction force, and flight time--and lower-limb surface EMG were recorded concurrently.

Double-leg approach-jump height peaked at 8 min in the 90%1RM group (40.50 {+/-} 1.73 cm). Single-leg approach-jump height was maximized at 8 min in the 80%1RM group (40.00 {+/-} 0.82 cm), exceeding the control condition. Kinetic and EMG analyses indicated that 90%1RM produced a delayed rectus femoris activation peak (8 min) and a later CMJ power peak (12 min), whereas 80%1RM facilitated earlier gastrocnemius activation (4 min) with a stable output profile; performance benefits with 70%1RM were minimal.

The F-box protein HAWAIIAN SKIRT (HWS) has been characterized as a crucial factor in targeted miRNA degradation in plants (pTMD), a process triggered by a specific type of target RNA called target mimicry. However, the precise mechanism by which HWS functions is still poorly understood. We previously established a genetic reporter system based on Short Tandem Target Mimicry of miR160 (STTM160) triggered miR160 degradation, resulting in pleiotropic developmental defects that are easy to monitor. Here, through an extensive forward genetic screen, we identified fourteen additional hws alleles that near-completely restored STTM160-induced developmental defects, highlighting a central role for HWS in pTMD. Intriguingly, we discovered two adjacent amino acid substitutions (R421K and G422D) in the PAZ domain of AGO1 that significantly suppressed the STTM160 phenotype. Similar to HWS dysfunction, the AGO1 R421K substitution caused a significant retention of target mimicry RNAs in AGO1 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that the R421 residue of AGO1 may cooperate with HWS for the clearance of AGO1-miRNA-target mimicry complexes. Although the R/G mutations only impacted a small set of endogenous miRNA levels, they were sufficient to rescue the developmental defects caused by HWS overexpression (HWS-OE), suggesting that the developmental abnormalities caused by HWS-OE largely depend on the AGO1-miRNA pathway.

Stochastic extensions and Fokker-Planck analysis show that microenvironmental noise enables escapes across the Allee barrier, consistent with long-term subthreshold experiments yielding a stationary, power-law-like distribution and under-threshold survival. Pg-Vp co-cultures further demonstrate replicate rescue outcomes for subcritical inocula. Critically, Vp reliably saturates to capacity, constraining terminal phases within the experimental horizon to coexistence (Pg persists with Vp at capacity) or Pg extinction. A two-species replicator model maps these outcomes onto a ({beta},{gamma}) plane, restricting accessible regions once Vp is established and suggesting interventions that reduce facilitation or variability to restore eubiosis and limit Pg-associated inflammation.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

It is driven majorly by clusters of circulating tumor cells which are often comprised of cells in a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype. Hybrid E/M phenotype has also been shown to be more tumor-initiating and therapy-resistant, but how cells maintain the hybrid E/M phenotype(s) remains an active area of investigation. Here, we develop a mathematical model that couples the intracellular dynamics of key players of Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) with the Androgen Receptor (AR), and cell-cell communication through Notch-Delta-Jagged signaling, in the context of prostate cancer. Our simulations show that AR can stabilize a hybrid E/M phenotype predominantly in the presence of Notch-Jagged, but not Notch-Delta, signaling. Implementing this model on a multi-cellular lattice, we observed that AR can alter the fraction of cells exhibiting a hybrid E/M and a mesenchymal phenotype. Finally, through analysis of transcriptomic and patient survival data, we found that the co-expression of AR and Jagged correlated with worse outcomes. Together, these results highlight the outcome of emergent dynamics between the Notch and AR signaling axis in promoting prostate cancer aggressiveness.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

This study aims to establish a human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived system that spontaneously manifests TDP-43 pathology driven by an ALS-associated TDP-43 mutation. Methods We generated forebrain 3-D organoid cultures from iPSC carrying the TDP-43 K181E patient mutation. Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to define transcriptional alterations across cell types, and enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation (eCLIP) was applied to examine the global RNA binding and splicing defects in mutant organoids. We further used immunostaining, RT-PCR and biochemical assays to confirm TDP-43 proteinopathy and validate findings from the multi-omics analyses. Results The TDP-43 K181E organoids recapitulated key disease features, including cytoplasmic p-TDP-43 accumulation, RNA dysregulation, and cryptic exon inclusion. Single-cell analysis revealed a population of immature neurons with enhanced neuroinflammation and altered translation capacity. Comparative transcriptomics showed that the ALS mutation-induced transcriptional changes strongly overlap with those in ALS patient-derived brains. eCLIP analysis showed that mutant TDP-43 exhibited altered RNA-binding specificity, resulting in widespread RNA mis-splicing and cryptic exon inclusion. RT-PCR confirmed PRDM2, a gene regulating cell senescence, is mis-spliced in mutant cells. These defects collectively disrupt neuronal homeostasis and cell-cell communications. Conclusions Our iPSC-derived forebrain organoid model displays spontaneous TDP-43 proteinopathies and associated molecular dysfunctions without artificial manipulation. The model offers a robust platform for dissecting the mechanisms of TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration and advancing therapeutic discovery in ALS and FTD.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Although widely supported behaviorally, the theory lacked direct neural evidence. Here, we used event-related fMRI with an optimized cue-target paradigm to test this account. Cued targets elicited stronger activation in the frontoparietal attention networks, including the bilateral frontal eye field (FEF) and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), and left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), consistent with the notion of attentional demand of reactivating the cue-initiated representations for integration. In contrast, uncued targets engaged the medial temporal cortex, particularly the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) and superior temporal gyrus (STG), reflecting the segregation processes associated with new object-file creation and novelty encoding. These dissociable activations provide the first direct neuroimaging evidence for the integration-segregation theory. Moreover, we observed neural interactions between IOR and cognitive conflict, suggesting a potential modulation of conflict processing by attentional orienting. Taken together, these findings provide new insights into exogenous attention by clarifying the neural underpinnings of integration and segregation and uncovering the interaction between spatial orienting and conflict processing.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

However, it is unclear whether this diminishes responses compared to isolated targeting of lineages with distinct immunogens. Here, we address this using an in silico model of naive B cell activation and affinity maturation in germinal centres. By incorporating (i) precursor properties and (ii) epitope masking by antibodies obtained from germinal centre-derived plasma cells, the model recapitulated features of bnAb lineage evolution as seen in pre-clinical mouse models.

Multiple brain regions have been implicated in opioid craving, but the brain-wide neural mechanisms underlying this process remain poorly understood. Using resting-state fMRI and connectome-based predictive modeling, we identified a whole-brain connectome that predicted the time-dependent increases (incubation) in oxycodone craving in individual rats after voluntary abstinence induced by exposure to an electric barrier. Incubation of oxycodone craving was operationally defined as the increase in non-reinforced lever pressing during relapse tests from early (day 1) to late (day 15) abstinence (incubation score). We found that changes in whole-brain functional connectivity during abstinence, but not during oxycodone self-administration, predicted the incubation score. Greater decreases in functional connectivity were associated with higher incubation scores. The predictive connectome involved complex interactions across multiple brain systems, including frontal-striatal, frontal-insula, insula-striatal, and hippocampal and sensorimotor circuits. To test causality of the predictive connectome, we examined the effect of pharmacological inactivation of dorsomedial striatum (DMS), which significantly decreased oxycodone seeking after electric barrier-induced abstinence. DMS inactivation increased connectivity strength within the predictive connectome, supporting a causal role of this connectome in incubation of oxycodone craving. The predictive connectome did not predict food-reward seeking after electric barrier-induced abstinence, indicating specificity to oxycodone craving. Our findings identify a brain-wide connectome marker that predicts individual differences in the incubation of opioid craving and provide potential targets for developing personalized interventions and monitoring therapeutic outcomes in opioid addiction treatment.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Consisting of a catalytic N-half and a cobalamin binding C-half, MTR utilises this intricate organometallic cofactor in the methyl transfer from methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine producing methionine. Cobalamin loading into MTR, and its subsequent activation, requires methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinuria Type D (MMADHC) protein and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR), respectively. However, the molecular basis of cobalamin binding and activation of human MTR aided by MMADHC and MTRR remains unknown. Here, using cryo-electron microscopy, we determined structures of human MTR in its apo, and cobalamin bound states. Apo MTR adopts a conformation where the two halves of the enzyme act independently with the C-half posed to bind cobalamin. Binding of cobalamin and its activation causes conformational changes in MTR that result in a flexible catalytically active state. AlphaFold predictions, validated by interaction studies, show that MMADHC interacts with the C-half of apo MTR to facilitate cobalamin loading. Unexpectedly we found that MTRR interacts at two distinct sites within the C-half of MTR which may aid in activation. Collectively these findings lay the groundwork to uncover the mechanisms through how MMADHC and MTRR coordinate cobalamin loading and activation of human MTR.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

MTB use magnetosomes to align with the geomagnetic field for improved navigation of their environment. To optimize this alignment, these species organize their magnetosomes in a linear fashion using a handful of factors including the bacterial actin-like protein MamK. Despite these shared features, there is a broad diversity of species-specific linear magnetosome chain arrangements within MTB, but the molecular mechanisms behind these phenotypic variations are unclear. Recently, genetic analyses showed that two proteins - McaA and McaB - interface with the chain organization machinery of Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1 to arrange magnetite crystals in a series of subchains rather than the single cohesive chains found in closely related MTB. Here, we use in vivo co-immunoprecipitation in AMB-1 to demonstrate protein-protein interactions between McaA, McaB, and MamK. Experiments with McaA truncation mutants and conditional control of McaB localization determined that McaA-McaB interactions are dependent on amino acids 530-665 of McaA and McaB localization to the magnetosome chain. We further show that disrupting the McaA-McaB interaction alters the spatial dynamics of MamK in vivo .

Disease surveillance can be carried out by detecting Trypanosoma DNA in tsetse, also known as molecular xenomonitoring. Whilst molecular methods can increase the efficiency and sensitivity of pathogen detection, trained staff and a well-equipped laboratory are required. In many cases, DNA extraction and screening is outsourced to a central laboratory in a major city either in-country or abroad, far removed from original tsetse collection sites. This increases results turnaround time, incurs transportation costs, and can lead to sample loss or damage. Methodology/Principle Findings We set out to develop, optimise and trial methods for tsetse xenomonitoring in a low-resource point-of-need setting. A low-cost protocol was developed consisting of rapid alkali-based DNA extraction and Trypanosoma detection qPCR assays using air-dryable reagent mixes. A minimally-equipped laboratory was established in a field station in Arua, Uganda. Following a training workshop, three entomology technicians carried out screening on 286 tsetse collected over a nine-week study period. The technicians consistently extracted high quality DNA (98% success rate) and were able to successfully detect T. brucei sensu lato, T. congolense and T. vivax DNA in 3.6% - 4.3% (95% confidence interval [1.73, 7.73]) of total tsetse.

Inhibition of endocytosis with filipin and OcTMAB significantly reduced infection across all spike variants. Low glycosylation levels on NSCs facilitated viral entry, and enzymatic removal of glycosylation increased their susceptibility.

Beyond ribose utilization, their central carbon metabolism exhibits a mosaic architecture shaped by the integration of foreign genes into the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. Uniquely, these genes appear to have been acquired through multiple independent transfer events, as reflected by their dispersed genomic locations and diverse bacterial donors, including other cyanobacteria and Pseudomonadota. These findings contradict the long-standing view of Gloeobacterales as metabolically primitive relics.

A variety of methods exist to detect recombinant sequences and their parental lineages in surveillance-scale datasets comprised of millions of SARS-CoV-2 genomes. However, these methods often rely on user-defined settings, such as the probability that a recombination breakpoint occurs between adjacent positions on the query sequence. In this study, we devise a hidden Markov model that detects recombinant SARS-CoV-2 sequences and identifies their parental lineages within a test set of sequences. Our method does not depend on user-defined parameters and can accommodate de novo mutations on the query sequence that are not present in the predicted parental lineages. To achieve this, we use maximum likelihood to estimate parameters that characterize the transition and emission probabilities in our hidden Markov model. Applying our method to 440,307 SARS-CoV-2 sequences sampled in England between September 2020 and March 2024, we detect 7,619 recombinant sequences corresponding to 1.73% (95% CI: [1.69%, 1.77%]) of all sampled sequences. We show a positive association between the proportion of query sequences detected as recombinant in each week and community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. This is consistent with higher prevalence increasing co-infection risk and promoting the emergence of recombinant sequences. We further observe localized clusters of recombination breakpoints within spike and in intergenic regions.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

While supervised sequence-based models trained directly on experimental data can predict variant effects, they often fail to generalize to significantly diverged sequences. We hypothesized that incorporating information from deep learning models of proteins (e.g., ESM, ProteinMPNN) could enhance generalizability. To test this hypothesis, we designed and experimentally screened several deep mutational libraries of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) for binding to the ACE2 receptor. Our large dataset encompasses over 43,000 sequence variants, exhibiting up to 26 substitutions away from the parental RBD sequence, thus exploring a significantly expanded sequence space compared to previous studies. Baseline supervised learning with one-hot encoded sequences achieved high accuracy within training sets but poor performance on unseen libraries. Integrating pre-trained protein model embeddings (ESM2) as a feature showed modest improvement in generalization. To further enhance predictive power, we developed a graph attention network architecture that combines representations of local residue environments using protein structure graphs with long-range inter-residue correlations captured by protein language model (PLM) embeddings (GAN-PLM). By explicitly modeling residue environments, interface geometry, and sequence dependencies, our graph attention model outperformed purely sequence-based models, achieving substantially higher balanced accuracies when predicting functional ACE2-binding variants across the diverse sequence space spanned by our independent libraries. This demonstrates the potential of structure- and sequence-based features into deep learning frameworks to achieve accurate and generalizable predictions of protein interface function, with broad implications for understanding and engineering protein interactions relevant to emerging infectious diseases and therapeutic protein design.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

In Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG) synthase LpiA and periplasmic hydrolase AcvB genes form an operon that controls Lys-PG levels. We determined the crystal structures of mature AcvB and its C-terminal catalytic domain at 3.1 [A] and 1.8 [A] resolution, respectively. The catalytic domain forms a negatively charged cavity that recognizes the positively charged Lys-PG head group through multiple acidic residues, including Asp271, Asp340, and Asp370. A hydrophobic protruding loop containing Trp378 and Leu379 mediates transient membrane association and contributes to Lys-PG acyl-chain recognition. Further, AcvB interacts with LpiA via its C-terminal domain, suggesting a cooperative module for Lys-PG turnover. These findings reveal the structural basis of Lys-PG hydrolysis and provide mechanistic insight into adaptive lipid modification at the bacterial membrane interface, and may guide future development of antibacterial agents against plant-pathogenic bacteria.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Despite initial correlations between specific damage features and age, cross-validation and external testing revealed no statistically significant predictive signal beyond mean-based baselines. These findings indicate that, in the current formulation, DNA damage information alone is insufficient for reliable age estimation.

Here, we employ the SIRAH coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the binding interface and structural rearrangements of proteins in the CENP-A nucleosome complexed with CENP-N. We aim to assess the stability of the CENP-A nucleosome and the change in its plasticity upon the CENP-N binding.

Of the many proteins involved in focal adhesions, vinculin plays a key role in mediating force-sensitive processes. Here, we combine optical tweezers and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy to measure the intensity and FRET efficiency of the vinculin tension sensor, VinTS, in response to a force. Fibroblasts expressing VinTS formed adhesions on fibronectin-coated, 3m-diameter, polystyrene beads, which were subjected to an optical trap with adjustable stiffness up to 0.26 pN/nm. After 5 min, the mean bead displacement was {approx}200nm in all trapping conditions inducing counteracting forces in the 10-100pN range. In response to the optical trap, vinculin recruitment and tension increased as a function of time. The mean increase in vinculin tension (1-2% decrease in absolute FRET efficiency) attained after 5 min was not significantly different at the different trapping conditions. However, vinculin recruitment was significantly higher at the higher trap stiffness with up to 35% increase in intensity at 0.26 pN/nm compared with <10% increase at 0.13 pN/nm, and an average 3% decrease in intensity for untrapped beads. The increase in vinculin intensity was correlated with the decrease in FRET efficiency at 0.26 pN/nm but not at lower stiffness. Thus, the presence of the high stiffness optical trap over 5 min appears to induce a positive correlation between vinculin recruitment and vinculin tension. In a few instances, vinculin puncta migrated a few microns away from the bead exceeding the bead's movement speed while experiencing an increase in both vinculin intensity and tension. Taken together, the results suggest that combining an optical trap with vinculin tension measurements uncovers novel vinculin dynamics in the presence of a force.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Elevated expression of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) isoforms is linked to increased metastatic potential and enhanced cellular plasticity in response to microenvironmental changes. To investigate the connection between VEGFA isoform expression, migration plasticity, and metastasis, we analyzed the migratory behavior of fibrosarcoma cells expressing single VEGFA isoforms within engineered microenvironments mimicking tumorassociated extracellular matrix (ECM) architectures that drive distinct migration modes. Fibrosarcoma cell lines expressing VEGFA120 or VEGFA188 were derived from embryonic (Fs120 and Fs188) or mature skin fibroblasts, ensuring comparable VEGFA isoform expression across cells of different origins. Characterization of collagen fibril diameter and organization in tumors derived from Fs120 or Fs188 cells showed that Fs120 tumors had a higher degree of fibril alignment, suggesting VEGFA120 expression may facilitate ECM remodeling to support metastasis. To simulate these different collagen fibril structures for use in migration studies in vitro, we developed 3D platforms representing aligned and randomly organized collagen fibers using electrospinning of polycaprolactone. On 2D surfaces favoring mesenchymal migration and on 3D electrospun scaffolds promoting contact-guided migration, VEGFA120- and VEGFA188-expressing cells exhibited similar migratory capacities, regardless of their origin. However, anti-VEGFA antibodies selectively inhibited the migration of VEGFA120-expressing cells on fibronectincoated surfaces and on aligned fiber scaffolds, but not non-aligned fibers, revealing isoform-specific sensitivity to VEGFA inhibition. In conclusion, while the expression of single VEGFA isoforms does not directly alter migration plasticity, VEGFA120 expression in mouse fibrosarcomas uniquely promotes ECM reorganization in tumors and cells expressing VEGF120 show increased sensitivity to anti-VEGFA antibodies.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Polystyrene NPs accumulated in fly brains and induced dose-dependent remodeling of mitochondrial membrane lipids, notably cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolamines, accompanied by increased diacylglycerols/triacylglycerols and monounsaturated fatty acids and by lipid-droplet expansion. Guided by these lipidomic signatures, targeted biochemical assays demonstrated depolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, elevated mitochondrial reactive-oxygen species, inhibition of respiratory-chain complexes I and IV, and a shift in NAD(H) and NADP(H) redox couples toward a reduced state and increasing lipid peroxidation. This redox imbalance was accompanied by decreased tyrosine-hydroxylase expression, dopamine depletion, and impaired locomotor behavior, hallmarks of PD-like neurodegeneration. Dopaminergic neurochemistry was impaired (tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine decreased), with concomitant reduction of GABA, and locomotor and circadian deficits emerged. Remarkbly, co-treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) restored mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced mitochondrial ROS and lipid peroxidation, normalized neutral lipid and MUFA accumulation, and rescued neurotransmitter levels and behavior. Stable-isotope tracing confirmed disrupted TCA cycle flux after NP exposure that was rescued by NAC.

It is also significantly increased with aging. Machine learning has also identified it as a brain-derived protein most predictive of Alzheimers disease (AD). HAPLN2 binds to CSPGs that may sequester aggregation-prone proteins and also restrict neuronal plasticity. Apolipoprotein 4 (APOE4) allele increases AD risk and thus in the present study we have examined hippocampal lysates from APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement (TR) mice using unbiased proteomics as well as Western blot and hippocampal immunostaining. Proteomics data show that HAPLN2 is among the most significantly upregulated proteins in APOE4 mice. Prior work suggests HAPLN2 is particularly important to the assembly of perinodal matrix. Herein we show that it also co-localizes with Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) positive perineuronal nets (PNNs). PNNs represent a dense form of ECM that can increase GABAergic neurotransmission to alter overall excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance and neuronal oscillations important to mood and memory.

Here we show that most transcription units (TUs) in Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 are not terminated by known termination pathways. Although many TUs (52%) have unique, well-defined 3' ends, only a small fraction have features that resemble canonical intrinsic terminators (22%).

Although high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection triggers A3B upregulation, potentially as part of an antiviral response, the impact of this restriction factor on papillomavirus replication and pathogenesis has yet to be assessed. To study human A3B antiviral function in the absence of a species-specific counter-defense, here we ask whether human A3B is capable of restricting Mus musculus papillomavirus (MmuPV1) in cellulo and in vivo. First, we created human A3B and catalytic mutant A3B-E255A expressing FVB/N mice. Second, MmuPV1 gene expression and replication was quantified in primary keratinocytes from these animals and, surprisingly, enzymatically active human A3B caused no measurable impairment in viral transcript or DNA accumulation. Third, A3B, catalytic mutant A3B-E255A, and nontransgenic FVB/N animals were infected with MmuPV1 and similar pathologies were found regardless of A3B functionality. Thus, despite likely never being exposed to human A3B during evolution, MmuPV1 appears to be unaffected by this potent, primate-specific antiviral factor.

Expansion and immunoelectron microscopy reveal that PfMyoF localises to a perinuclear membrane compartment. Our findings define PfMyoF as the first known myosin with a Rab-like domain and highlight its potential role in parasite membrane trafficking pathways.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we develop and employ a co-aggregation (aggregoid) approach combining embryonic and extraembryonic endoderm-like cells to mimic spatial interactions in developing mouse embryos. The obtained embryo models show the appearance of a regionalized primitive streak-like structure that results in the formation of node and notochord, enriched endoderm populations, increased mesoderm diversity including cardiopharyngeal lineages and vascular endothelium in an overall anteriorized and ventralized phenotype.

Forefront to urchin barren formation is a behavioral switch where sedentary urchins become active and graze upon attached kelp. This is hypothesized to occur when the availability of drift (i.e., detached kelp on the surface of the reef), which urchins are believed to prefer over intact and attached kelp, declines. Although observed repeatedly, the density-dependent nature of this apparent resource preference has not been characterized quantitatively. We used a series of subtidal functional response experiments in central California, USA, to quantify how consumption rates by Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (purple urchins) on Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp) and drift varied with their relative availability and over time as urchins became satiated. Our experiments indicate that the preference for drift over kelp is strong when drift and kelp are at equal abundance, that the abundance of drift has a strong effect on kelp consumption but not vice versa, and that the preferences for drift is indeed density dependent with the qualitative switch to a greater preference for kelp occurring when the availability of drift declines below approximately 1 g of drift for every 82 g of kelp. Our analyses suggest further that maintaining a minimum of approximately 1 g of drift for every 1 g of kelp is sufficient to all but preclude urchins from grazing on live kelp. We recommend these thresholds be used by managers to inform the use of drift subsidies to preserve and restore kelp forests.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

In plants, however, the contribution of homologous recombination (HR) to genomic instability remains unclear. The semidominant sulfur mutant of tobacco, named for its yellow foliage resulting from a chlorophyll defect, spontaneously develops green and white twin spots that have been attributed to mitotic crossovers. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced DNA from twin spots and surrounding tissues in su/+ F1 hybrids, expecting somatic crossovers to result in reciprocal chromosome arm exchange in the paired sectors. Contrary to expectations, 20 of 22 twin spots exhibited aneuploidy or reciprocal translocations between non-homologous chromosomes. One twin spot showed a pattern consistent with a reciprocal crossover. Single white or green spots were ~10X more frequent than twin spots. Among 26 single spots, 18 resulted from terminal arm deletion, 2 from aneuploidy, and 4 were associated with translocations. Deletion and reciprocal exchange breakpoints clustered near the centromere. Together, these findings indicate that nearly all spots arise from deletions, translocations, and other rearrangements likely mediated by chromosome missegregation or nonhomologous repair rather than by HR. These rearrangements altered the ratio of mutant to wild-type alleles and consequently chlorophyll levels. We conclude that mitotic recombination between homologous chromosomes is rare, and that genome instability is the dominant driver of somatic chimerism in this system.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Yet in Earth's prebiotic era, several amino acids - particularly the canonical basic residues lysine, arginine, and histidine - were likely scarce, unlike the more readily available acidic amino acids. Moreover, protein-length polymers were inaccessible before ribosomal synthesis emerged, and peptides were probably short, statistical, and non-templated. How the earliest proteins and enzymes emerged under these constraints remains a central question in origins-of-life research. Here, we synthesize random peptide libraries that span a broad electrostatic spectrum and systematically interrogate their properties. The data indicate that a prebiotically plausible acidic alphabet stands out in its propensity for secondary structure and higher-order soluble assembly via formation of beta-sheets. These assemblies arise from highly heterogeneous sequences, plausibly reflecting the statistical diversity of early Earth peptides, and differ from amyloid structures in both solubility and morphology. Our results further show that the acidic random peptides have inherent capacity to bind certain metal ions, implying their potential to contribute to prebiotic catalysis. Using a large language model for structural prediction, we further show that peptides composed of this acidic alphabet exhibit a strong propensity for compact conformations. Altogether, this study showcases that unevolved sequences of prebiotically-abundant amino acids can readily produce foldable self-assembling polymers, potentially providing a steppingstone toward the first proteins, prior to the onset of purifying selection.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

Most untargeted metabolomic methods are inaccessible, either due to upfront instrument costs or intensive technical training. More accessible methods using diode array detectors often only utilize a few wavelengths, preventing high-throughput observation of total metabolic diversity. Methods: Leaves from the genera Betula, Magnolia, Rosa, and Viburnum were collected, dried and ground, extracted, and analyzed by HPLC-DAD. Chromatographic data was then processed in a curated R pipeline, and resulting resolved peaks were clustered by absorbance spectra using Gaussian Finite Mixture Models (GMMs). To assess clustering, GMM was compared to a more traditional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method, with clusters identified through literature searches. Results: Significant associations between the abundances of chemical classes and whole-metabolome alpha and beta diversity indices were recovered. In general, GMMs performed better than other classification methods like LDA, especially between classes that share common features like non-flavonoid phenolics and flavonoids.

A.; Shorthouse, D.; Hall, B. A.", "abstract": "Interpretation of variants of uncertain significance remains a major problem in genomic analysis. Whilst statistical models can be used to predict pathogenicity, they offer no insights into the biophysical mechanism of variant action, and genomic data available for training is biased towards the subpopulations who have access. Protein misfolding has been found to act as a frequent mechanism for loss of gene or domain activity, where it is typically responsible for ~2/3 of disease-causing variants and somatic mutations. The accuracy of energy predictions however has consistently been challenged by highly variable correlation coefficients reported from different proteins, and the unknown impact of alternative structures where available. Here we address this directly through a systematic analysis of mega-scale folding experimental results, enabled by a fully automated predictive pipeline based on FoldX. We find that whilst absolute correlation coefficients are mediocre for three highly studied proteins (PIN1, Spg, and FYN, ranging from 0.29-0.43), the correlation coefficient alone does not capture the full predictive power of the estimates. Specifically, we find a clear linear relationship between experimental and theoretical result, with a small number of outlier residues responsible for reducing the correlation. We show that the quantitative accuracy of predictions can be improved by aggregating estimates taken from different structures, and that the problematic outlier residues can be both empirically and theoretically identified, allowing us to flag low-confidence values. Our findings not only provide a framework for identifying problematic mutations in advance but also offers new insights into potential improvements of the FoldX protocol for more accurate protein stability predictions.

Through an unbiased systems biology approach, we previously identified a therapeutically relevant seven gene set that drives CRPC. The mitotic checkpoint kinase, BUB1B (BUBR1) is a key member of this gene set, and we report here that BUB1B is a tractable and promising new therapeutic target in aggressive, treatment-resistant PC. We found that high BUB1B expression is correlated with PC progression and aggressiveness. In established CRPC cells, BUB1B depletion blocked cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and mitosis delay. Ectopic expression of BUB1B, at levels found in CRPC, conferred castration-resistant growth of androgen-dependent PC cells in vitro and in vivo. We showed that BUB1B kinase activity was essential for CRPC progression, as only wild type (wt) BUB1B and neither of two kinase-dead mutants promoted castration-resistant growth of androgen-dependent PC cells. Rescue experiments with wt or kinase-dead mutants showed further that BUB1B kinase activity was also required to maintain proliferation of established CRPC cells. While persistent androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a mechanism of CRPC progression, BUB1B promotion of CRPC was not dependent on AR as assessed through AR knockdown. Consistent with an AR-bypass mechanism, ectopic expression of BUB1B rendered PC cells resistant to enzalutamide in vitro and in vivo. Our data points to BUB1B as a key driver of CRPC progression and enzalutamide resistance and suggests that targeting BUB1B kinase is a promising therapeutic approach for lethal, treatment-resistant disease.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

This study integrates theoretical modeling and empirical trials to examine how the temporal structure of humidity-ramp protocols affects the accuracy of estimated critical environmental limits (CELs). Methods: A first-order model was developed to describe Tcr response to stepwise changes in equilibrium core temperature (Tcr,eq) determined by ambient humidity at a fixed dry-bulb temperature. Analytical solutions were derived for discrete humidity steps of duration {Delta}t, and sensitivity analyses were conducted across physiologically plausible time constants ({tau}). Fourteen healthy young males (23.5{+/-}1.8 yrs) completed two randomized trials in a 42 {degrees}C heat chamber: 1) Slow-ramp: 4-hour equilibration at 40% RH followed by +6% RH/hour for 2 h, then +3% RH/hour (40-61% RH); and 2) Aggressive-ramp: 30 min equilibration followed by +2% RH every 5 min (28-88% RH). Rectal and skin temperatures, heart rate, and perceptual ratings were recorded continuously. Results: When {Delta}t/{tau}<<1, residual disequilibrium between Tcr,eq and Tcr accumulates, producing accelerated rises in Tcr and premature CELs. Longer dwell durations ([&ge;]1 hour) allowed near-equilibrium responses, yielding physiologically valid thresholds. Empirically, shorter ramp durations shifted apparent CELs downward by by 3.4{+/-}1.9 {degrees}C.

While the transcriptional response to LPS stimulation has been characterized, the role of alternative splicing (AS) in modulating this response remains largely unexplored. Methods: Using deep RNA sequencing of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from three healthy female donors, we evaluated transcriptome-wide differential gene expression and alternative splicing in response to LPS stimulation. Results: Our global differential gene expression and pathway impact analyses identified 490 differentially expressed genes and 46 significantly perturbed KEGG pathways, recapitulating known LPS-induced inflammatory responses and identifying two novel signaling pathways, (e.g., SNARE interactions in vesicular transport and the mRNA surveillance pathways). Differential alternative splicing analysis revealed critical impacts on immune-related pathways, including Toll-like receptor signaling, PI3K/AKT signaling, and pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization. Notably, we identified alternative splicing events in genes such as MyD88 and TLR4, which play key roles in terminating inflammatory signaling, as well as splicing of long non-coding RNAs (e.g., MALAT1, PVT1) with potential regulatory functions in immune responses.

Bifidobacterium bifidum is a key commensal bacterium in the human gut microbiota with recognized probiotic properties and health benefits. An underinvestigated strain called 900791, isolated from meconium of a Siberian infant and with a validated role in lactose tolerance, requires more understanding of the genomic basis of its potential probiotic functionality. Methods. We performed whole genome sequencing of strain 900791 using hybrid sequencing (Illumina NextSeq and Nanopore). The genome was functionally annotated and compared against 228 B. bifidum genomes to elucidate probiotic determinants and evolutionary relationships. Antibiotic resistance profiling was conducted using three independent approaches, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) were characterized using dbCAN analysis; additionally different markers for desired phenotypes in probiotics (such as adherence to epithelial cells, resistance to low pH, bile salts and oxidative stress, and the ability to produce bacteriocins) were also investigated. Results. The complete genome comprises 2.28 Mb with 62.43% G+C content, encoding 1,852 ORFs, 53 tRNAs, and three complete 16S rRNA genes. Phylogenomic analysis revealed 900791 belongs to a distinct clonal subgroup of nine closely related strains sharing almost identical allelic similarity (observed via cgMLST). The pangenome analysis of 229 B. bifidum genomes showed an open structure with 4,679 orthogroups, including 1,212 core families.The strain 900791 harbors extensive CAZymes from families GH2, GH20, GH33, and GH84 associated with mucin and human milk oligosaccharide degradation, plus GH2 and GH42 families for lactose metabolism. Safety assessment revealed only intrinsic resistance to mupirocin and rifampicin, with no acquired resistance markers or virulence factors. The strain possesses multiple stress tolerance systems including acid resistance (FF-ATPase), bile salt resistance (MFS transporters, BSH hydrolase), and oxidative stress response mechanisms. Predicted probiotic features include adhesion proteins (FimA/FimB, FimM), bacteriocin production capabilities, and comprehensive stress response systems. Conclusion. B. bifidum 900791 harbors markers for significant probiotic potential with genetic features optimized for gut colonization, host interaction, and antimicrobial competition.

Despite their ecological and evolutionary significance, QS mechanisms in Archaea remain poorly characterized. The halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii provides a model for archaeal QS, transitioning from motile rods to non-motile disks in a density-dependent response to a secreted disk-forming signal (DFS). To identify components of the DFS regulatory network, we screened for spontaneous mutants that retained motility in DFS-containing soft-agar medium. One candidate, HVO_1357, encodes a predicted response regulator located adjacent to a histidine kinase (HVO_1356) and a second response regulator (HVO_1358), consistent with an extended two-component regulatory system (TCS). Based on our results, these genes encode quorum-sensing associated regulators (Qar), therefore, we propose rename them qarA (HVO_1357), qarB (HVO_1356), and qarC(HVO_1358). Deletion of qarA enabled cells to swim on DFS-containing soft-agar plates and conferred hypermotility on standard soft-agar media; however, these phenotypes were not due to changes in motility-related parameters, but a reduced sensitivity to DFS for induction of the non-motile, disk-shaped state. In contrast, {Delta}qarB and {Delta}qarC strains were non-motile and exhibited premature disk formation during normal growth. Suppressor mutations that restored motility to {Delta}qarB and {Delta}qarC mapped exclusively to qarA, suggesting QarA is the central regulator of this system. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that qarA deletion leads to upregulation of genes involved in motility and rod-shape formation.

Loss of pVir conferred fitness advantages in vitro, reduced capsule production and hypermucoviscosity, and promoted biofilm formation, while markedly attenuating virulence in murine sepsis models.

However, how seipin loss causes adipose tissue failure remains unclear. Using human adipocyte progenitor cells capable of robust differentiation in vitro and in vivo, we reveal two unexpected findings that redefine CGL2 pathogenesis. First, seipin is dispensable for lipid droplet biogenesis but essential for recruiting the major adipocyte scaffold protein Perilipin 1 (PLIN1) to the lipid droplet surface. Second, we discover that the integrity of the lipid droplet serves as an organelle to nucleus quality control checkpoint enforcing adipocyte identity. Without seipin-dependent PLIN1 recruitment, adipocytes exhibit enhanced lipolysis and ceramide accumulation, triggering an unexpected cellular response of de-differentiation into a progenitor-like state. From this de-differentiated state, cells can undergo additional cycles of differentiation and de-differentiation upon repeated adipogenic stimuli. However, some cells escape de-differentiation, instead forming a single large droplet and displaying severe cellular structural abnormalities. Consistent with this model, we find functional adipose tissue can form in vivo from seipin-deficient cells, yet ultimately fails. These findings resolve conflicting models of CGL2 pathogenesis by reframing seipin as a regulator of PLIN1 recruitment, rather than droplet formation per se, and reveal the fundamental role of lipid droplet integrity in the development of functional human adipocytes.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

In delegated control one of the feedbacks submits its entire compensatory flux to the system, while the other feedback is the actual controller by neutralizing the excess flux of its antagonistic partner. In isolated control the compensatory flux of one of the controllers is negligible while the other feedback regulates the controlled variable alone. It is shown that delegated and isolated control can exhibit environmentally (i.e. perturbation) driven setpoint changes (rheostasis). A striking example is the photoperiodic control of Siberian hamsters' body weights. A third control type is metastable control. Here a single addition or removal or the application of a set of pulsatile or continuous additions/removals can cause a switch to the antagonistic partner's controller regime, but resets to its original control mode once additions or removals stop. High-affinity and low-affinity compensatory flux kinetics can be distinguished, which have significant influences on the control regions' extensions when viewed within a perturbation phase diagram. Integral windup can induce temporary metastable setpoint changes or even lead to robust perfect adaptation without integral feedback! How the setpoint in blood glucose homeostasis arises is still debated. A dual-controller approach with two setpoints can describe many properties of blood glucose homeostasis and the roles of insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

H.", "abstract": "Cholesterol is an essential component of eukaryotic cell membranes, influencing membrane packing, fluidity, and domain formation. Replicating these properties in model membranes is critical for reconstitution studies, but common emulsion-based methods for producing giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) fail to incorporate cholesterol efficiently. Here, we use methyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin-cholesterol (M{beta}CD-CL) complexes to deliver cholesterol into GUVs produced by the emulsion droplet interface crossing encapsulation (eDICE) method and demonstrate a convenient way to quantify the degree of cholesterol incorporation using fluorescent membrane biosensors. Spectral imaging of NR12A as well as fluorescence lifetime imaging of Flipper-TR revealed dose-dependent increases in cholesterol content for DOPC GUVs upon M{beta}CD-CL addition, consistent with increased membrane order. By calibrating these effects against GUVs with defined cholesterol contents prepared via gel-assisted swelling, we found that the cholesterol content of eDICE vesicles can be increased to at least 40 mol%. Binary mixtures of DOPC with saturated lipids (DMPC and PC(18:0-14:0)) showed a similar trend as pure DOPC GUVs. Interestingly, we could trigger liquid-ordered domain formation by adding cholesterol to DOPC:DMPC vesicles. Our findings provide a quantitative and non-disruptive method to modulate and assess cholesterol content in emulsion-based GUVs, advancing their use in bottom-up synthetic biology and membrane biophysics.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

J.; Ghose, S.; Cho, S.; McDonough, E.; Chadwick, C.; West, R.; Brooks, J. D.; Chung, D.; Ginty, F.; Machiraju, R.; Mallick, P.", "abstract": "Prostate cancer is classified as \"immune-cold\" due to limited infiltration of immune cells and no clear correlation between immune cells and clinical outcomes. However, immune cells are found in prostate cancers and the spatial relationships between these immune cells and cancer cells/glands have not been investigated, partly due to a lack of automated tools that classify both cancerous cells/glands. In this paper, we have developed an end-to-end tool (TOPAZ: Tissue Organization identification using sPAtial proteomics) that combines multiplexed single-cell protein data with histology images to: 1): predict cancerous versus non-cancerous epithelial cells using a Gaussian-mixture model; 2) predict cancerous/non-cancerous gland type using a principal curve estimation. Using TOPAZ to assign cancer and non-cancerous labels to cells and glands, we extracted multiscale spatial features from the classification results--including immune dense-region geometrical features and cell-to-gland distances--and correlated the features with risk of biochemical recurrence and cancer grade. Tissue-microarrays containing 753 cores from 217 prostate cancer patients underwent multiplexed immunofluorescent imaging (Cell DIVE, Leica) for epithelial cell markers (panCK26, S6, NaKATPase), basal cell markers (p63, CK5), a cancer cell marker (AMACR), and T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD68). Cancerous/non-cancerous cell classification from TOPAZ achieved 82% sensitivity and 99% specificity against expert annotation, and the pipeline further predicted cancerous/non-cancerous glands without manual threshold tuning. Regulatory-T-cell and helper-T-cell percentages decreased, and macrophage percentage increased with grade increase (P < 0.05). When the median distance from cancerous gland centroids to the nearest regulatory or helper T-cell exceeded approximately 50 {micro}m, the hazard of biochemical recurrence doubled (log-rank P < 0.01). The open-source Shiny app TOPAZ (https://chunglab.bmi.osumc.edu/TOPAZ) packages the workflow, predicting individual cell types and gland shapes. By combining probabilistic cell typing with gland-shape modeling, TOPAZ yields interpretable multiscale spatial features linked to prognosis and is released as an open web app for unrestricted use.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}

C.; Morielli, A. D.", "abstract": "The voltage gated potassium channel Kv1.2 plays a key role in the central nervous system and mutations in Kv1.2 leads to neurological disorders such as epilepsies and ataxias. In the cerebellum regulation of Kv1.2 is coupled to learning and memory. We have previously shown that blocking Kv1.2 by infusing its specific inhibitor Tityustoxin-k (TsTX) into the lobulus simplex of the cerebellum facilitates eyeblink conditioning (EBC) and that EBC modulates Kv1.2 surface expression in cerebellar interneurons. The metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1 is required for EBC although the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we show that infusion of the mGluR1 agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) into the lobulus simplex of the cerebellum mimics the faciliatory effect of TsTX on EBC. We therefore hypothesize that mGluR1 could act, in part, through suppression of Kv1.2. Earlier studies have shown that Kv1.2 suppression involves channel tyrosine phosphorylation and its endocytocytic removal from the cell surface. In this study we report that an excitatory chemical stimulus (50mM K+-100 microM glutamate) applied to cerebellar slices enhanced Kv1.2 tyrosine phosphorylation and that this increase was lessened in the presence of the mGluR1 inhibitor YM298198. More direct evidence for mGluR1 modulation of Kv1.2 comes from our finding that selective activation of mGluR1 with DHPG reduced the amount of Kv1.2 detected by cell surface biotinylation in cerebellar slices. To determine the molecular pathways involved we used an unbiased mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach to identify Kv1.2-protein interactions that are modulated by mGluR1. Among the interactions enhanced by DHPG were those with PKC-{gamma}, CaMKII and Gq/G11, each of which had been shown in other studies to co-immunoprecipitate with mGluR1 and contribute to its signaling. Of particular note was the interaction between Kv1.2 and PKC-{gamma} since in HEK cells and hippocampal neurons Kv1.2 endocytosis is elicited by PKC activation. Here we show that activation of PKCs with PMA reduced surface Kv1.2, while the PKC inhibitor Go6983 attenuated the reduction in surface Kv1.2 levels elicited by DHPG, suggesting that the mechanism by which mGluR1 modulates cerebellar Kv1.2 likely involves PKC.", "date": "2025-11-10", "journal": ""}
