To characterize commonalities and differences regarding primate vocalization representations in the human brain, the inclusion of closely related primates, especially chimpanzees and bonobos, is needed. We hypothesized that commonalities would depend on both phylogenetic and acoustic proximity, with chimpanzees ranking the closest to Homo. Presenting human participants with four primate species vocalizations (rhesus macaques, chimpanzees, bonobos and humans) and taking into account acoustic distance or removing voxels explained solely by vocalization low-level acoustics, we observed within-TVA enhanced left and right anterior superior temporal gyrus activity for chimpanzee compared to all other species, and chimpanzee compared to human vocalizations. Our results provide evidence for a common neural basis in the TVA for the processing of phylogenetically and acoustically close vocalizations, namely those of humans and chimpanzees.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

In real life situations, relevant and non-relevant stimuli are often embedded in a continuous sensory stream, presumably represented by different segments of neural activity. Here, we introduce a neural circuit model that can learn to identify action-relevant stimuli embedded in a spatio-temporal stream of spike trains, while learning to ignore stimuli that are not behaviorally relevant. The model uses a biologically plausible plasticity rule and learns from the reinforcement of correct decisions taken at the right time. Learning is fully online; it is successful for a wide spectrum of stimulus-encoding strategies; it scales well with population size; and can segment cortical spike patterns recorded from behaving animals. Altogether, these results provide a biologically plausible theory of reinforcement learning in the absence of prior information on the relevance and timing of input stimuli.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

While many are endemic, some are transported by currents from the Atlantic Ocean along an environmental gradient that steepens at the polar front. Despite these distinct biogeographies, the functional characteristics of these communities remain poorly characterized. Here, we analyzed twenty metatranscriptomes from a North Atlantic-Arctic environmental gradient considering ocean currents transport times. Functions related to the regulation of gene expression and cold acclimation were more abundant in Arctic metatranscriptomes. Using the PHATE dimensionality reduction algorithm, reconstructed transcriptomes of Bacillariophyta, Mamiellales, Pelagophyceae, and Phaeocystales revealed different gene expression patterns, including photosynthesis regulation. All groups showed upregulation of numerous key temperature-associated functions and a subset of shared functions, supporting a convergence in transcriptomic changes under polar conditions. This study, based on a new resource of reconstructed transcriptomes, addressed the functional differentiation of eukaryotic phytoplankton across the North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean. It evidenced both differential and convergent changes in gene expression across the polar front in widespread phytoplankton types.

A.; Masel, J.", "abstract": "Nearly neutral theory predicts that species with higher effective population size (Ne) are better at purging slightly deleterious mutations. We compare evolution in high-Ne vs. low-Ne vertebrates to reveal subtle selective preferences among amino acids. We take three complementary approaches. First, we fit non-stationary substitution models using maximum likelihood, comparing the high-Ne clade of rodents and lagomorphs to its low-Ne sister clade of primates and colugos. Second, we compared evolutionary outcomes across a wider range of vertebrates, via correlations between amino acid frequencies and the codon adaptation index of species, a proxy for Ne. Third, we dissected which amino acids substitutions occurred in human, chimpanzee, mouse, and rat, as scored by parsimony -- this also enabled comparison to a historical paper. All three methods agree on amino acid preference under more effective selection. Preferred amino acids are less costly to synthesize and use GC-rich codons, which are hard to maintain under AT-biased mutation. These factors explain 85% of the variance in amino acid preferences. Within highly exchangeable pairs of amino acids, arginine is strongly preferred over lysine, valine over isoleucine, and aspartate over glutamate, consistent with more effective selection preferring a marginally larger free energy of folding. The first two of these preferences, but not the third, match differences between thermophiles and mesophilic relatives. These results reveal the biophysical consequences of mutation-selection-drift balance, and demonstrate the utility of nearly neutral theory for understanding protein evolution.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Rhino binds to H3K9me3 on these clusters, yet the mechanism controlling its binding to clusters remains unclear. Here, we used cultured ovarian somatic cells (OSCs), which lack endogenous Rhino and its stabilizer Kipferl, whose absence renders the dual-strand clusters inert, and found that exogenous Rhino tends to bind to the ends of dual-strand clusters with asymmetric dimethylarginine histones (ADMA-histones). Depletion of the arginine methyltransferases responsible for ADMA modifications, such as DART4, affected the genomic localization of Rhino in both OSCs and ovaries. We also identified primitive, cluster-like genomic regions, termed DART4 piSL, where Rhino propagates in an DART4-dependent but unstable manner. Our study proposes that ADMA-histones play a crucial role in the initial genome loading of Rhino and may establish the potential sites of its propagation, which are subsequently stabilized to support piRNA production.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

In osteoporosis, increased bone resorption activity leads to structural deterioration and elevated fracture risk.

Here, we investigate the joint effects of load-bearing physical and pharmacological treatment in a female mouse model of osteoporosis using longitudinal in vivo micro-computed tomography and computational mechanics. We demonstrate that mechanical loading additively and synergistically enhanced predicted strength, bone volume, and mechanoregulation parameters when combined with anabolic therapies (parathyroid hormone and sclerostin antibody) but not with anti-catabolic treatments (bisphosphonates). Increases in predicted strength were associated with reductions in bone resorption rates, shifts in the (re)modeling thresholds as anticipated by Frost in the mechanostat theory, and the modeling capacity of anabolic pharmacological treatments. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of combining anabolic pharmacological therapies with load-bearing physical activity, particularly in early treatment phases, to optimize bone adaptation and fracture prevention in osteoporosis management.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Environmental DNA (eDNA) monitoring has been used for great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) survey in the UK since the publication of a Defra-funded trial in 2014. If eDNA results are to be used in support of a great crested newt licence, surveys must be performed during a 76-day survey window (15 April - 30 June) to coincide with peak great crested newt activity, and must follow the approved ethanol precipitation protocol. However, eDNA detection is possible in other months and filtration may be a more effective method of eDNA capture. 2. We investigated whether the great crested newt eDNA survey season could be extended and filtration could be used for great crested newt eDNA capture by reviewing the available evidence and conducting a field study from April to October 2022. Paired water samples for ethanol precipitation and filtration were collected from 25 ponds once a month, resulting in 124 samples of each type. All samples (N = 248) were analysed with the approved great crested newt quantitative PCR assay. 3. Our results indicate that great crested newts can be reliably detected using both eDNA capture methods from April to August, with detection rates decreasing in September and October. Great crested newt eDNA detection was comparable or higher with filtration than ethanol precipitation. 4. Practical implication. Acceptance of filtration for great crested newt eDNA surveys could allow more water to be processed for robust and reliable estimates of great crested newt presence. Extending the great crested newt eDNA survey season to August could allow more waterbodies to be surveyed for great crested newt presence (but not absence), and identification of sites that provide important habitat for great crested newts outside of the breeding season. This would also remove logistical challenges and costs associated with completing sampling within 11 weeks and laboratory analysis within 10 working days from sample receipt. Furthermore, great crested newt eDNA surveys could be more frequently carried out alongside monitoring for other species, which are typically surveyed from April to September/October or year-round with conventional methods or eDNA surveys using filtration. This could enable infrastructure projects to develop more effective mitigation measures as well as reduce time required from surveyors and survey costs.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Here we performed a forward genetic screen in Drosophila and identified glucosylceramide synthase (GlcT), a rate-limiting enzyme for glycosphingolipid (GSL) production, whose mutation causes the development of secretory cell tumors. Genetic analysis of the GSL synthesis pathway, combined with metabolite rescue experiments, revealed that the tumor formation is linked to a deficiency in Mactosylceramide/Lactosylceramide. This deficiency impaired the endocytic recycling of the Delta, subsequently reducing Notch signaling activation. Conditional knockout of UGCG, the mammalian ortholog of GlcT, in mouse small intestine caused an excessive differentiation of goblet cells, phenotypes similar to these caused by Notch inhibition.

As a consequence, interventions that enhance lysosome function are of keen interest in the context of drug development. Throughout the biomedical literature, evolutionary biologists have found cases in which challenges faced by humans in clinical settings have been resolved by non-model organisms adapting to wild environments. Here, we used a primary cell culture approach to survey lysosomal characteristics in species of the genus Mus. We found that fibroblasts from M. spretus, a wild Mediterranean mouse, exhibited elevated lysosomal mass and enzyme activity along with reduced activity of {beta}-galactosidase, a classical marker of cellular senescence, compared to those from M. musculus, a related species adapted to human-associated environments. We propose that classic laboratory models of lysosome function and senescence may reflect characters that diverge from the phenotypes of wild mice. The M. spretus phenotype may ultimately serve as a blueprint for interventions that ameliorate lysosomal dysfunction under conditions of stress and disease.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

The limited amount of drug substance available during development, coupled with extensive analytical requirements, restrict the number of excipients that can be empirically screened. There is a strong need for in silico tools to optimize excipient pre-selection before wet lab experiments. Here, we introduce Excipient Prediction Software (ExPreSo), a supervised machine learning algorithm that suggests excipients based on the properties of the protein drug substance and target product profile. ExPreSo was trained on a dataset comprising 335 regulatory-approved peptide and protein drug products. Predictive features included protein structural properties, protein language model embeddings, and drug product characteristics. ExPreSo showed good performance for the nine most prevalent excipients in biopharmaceutical formulations and minimal overfitting. A fast variant of ExPreSo using only sequence-based input features showed similar prediction power to slower models that relied on molecular modeling. Notably, an ExPreSo variant using only protein-based input features also showed good performance, indicating resilience to the influence of platform formulations. To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning algorithm to suggest biopharmaceutical excipients based on the dataset of regulatory-approved drug products. Overall, ExPreSo shows great potential to reduce the time, costs, and risks associated with excipient screening during formulation development.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

C.; Glass, M.; Grimsey, N. L.", "abstract": "Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2) is a promising therapeutic target for modulating inflammation. Canonical signalling responses to receptor ligands are critically dependent on cell surface receptor expression. However, it is also now appreciated that intracellular G protein-coupled receptors can contribute to signalling responses and influence functional outcomes. Therefore, understanding how the subcellular distribution of receptors is controlled is also highly pertinent. CB2 is observed to be expressed at the cell surface as well as having a considerable proportion expressed intracellularly. Despite this distribution being well established, little is known about the regulation of CB2 anterograde trafficking and subcellular distribution. We report that sustained treatment with a range of CB2 agonists and inverse agonists stimulates a distinct population of CB2 to be delivered to the cell surface, at various expression levels and despite agonists concurrently internalising cell surface CB2. We present evidence that this ligand-stimulated anterograde trafficking is a result of CB2 agonists, as well as inverse agonists, acting as pharmacological chaperones. We also report that a di-lysine (KK) motif in the CB2 C-terminal tail is required for basal delivery to the cell surface. Corroborating the hypothesis that CB2 ligands can act as pharmacological chaperones, sustained CB2 ligand stimulation induces cell surface expression of the mutated receptor and alters maturation states as measured by western blotting. Our finding that prolonged exposure to CB2 ligands can induce CB2 cell surface delivery via pharmacological chaperoning may well have important implications for optimal design of CB2-targeted therapeutics.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Managers must weigh potential costs and benefits of choosing well-differentiated donor individuals that could confer a boost to genetic diversity while avoiding outbreeding depression or ecological mismatch. This decision is more daunting when taxonomy is unclear or debated. For example, bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations in the United States that have been managed as the \"California\" lineage (part of the formerly recognized subspecies O. c. californiana) originate from serial translocations sourced from populations in British Columbia, resulting in reduced genetic diversity and elevated risk of inbreeding. After research on skull shape and RFLP analysis of mtDNA failed to find support for that subspecies, some jurisdictions treated the California lineage as part of the Rocky Mountain subspecies (O. c. canadensis) and mixed individuals in subsequent translocations, in part to increase genetic diversity of bottlenecked populations. Yet detailed genetic data addressing validity of those putative lineages were lacking. We reconstructed the genetic history of bighorn sheep by sampling the major putative subspecies or lineages, focusing on native (remnant) genetic variation, and generating high-throughput DNA sequencing data (~15,000-25,000 SNPs). Complementary phylogenetic and population genetic analyses supported the distinctiveness of four bighorn lineages at levels corresponding to subspecies. Our results confirm the genetic identity of the no longer putative California bighorn lineage, answering a question that puzzled geneticists and managers for decades. Moving forward, we recommend that managers 1) maintain the natural variation held in native populations by protecting them from intentional translocations or unintentional mixing with nearby populations; 2) prioritize within-lineage translocations for population augmentation or repatriation to previously occupied regions; and 3) cautiously consider any translocations that would lead to mixing of distinct evolutionary lineages.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Understanding gut environmental changes is essential for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for gut health. However, non-invasive methods for continuous monitoring remain limited. The bacterial gut microbiota represents a powerful platform for continuous, non-invasive biosensing technologies for the gut environment, with genetically tractable commensal species like Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (B. theta) emerging as promising hosts for engineered biosensors. However, the availability of genetic tools for precise, modular environmental sensing and reporting control in B. theta remains limited. Here, we present an expanded genetic engineering toolkit for B. theta that enables precise, fluorescence-based environmental sensing of the gut environment. This toolkit includes i) three libraries of orthogonally inducible promoters capable of driving fluorescence expression, ii) a DNA-based system to tune repressor activity in B. theta, iii) a resulting modular transcriptional reporter circuit that integrates native promoter activation with fluorescent outputs, and iv) characterization of a novel plasmid integration mode in B. theta. To demonstrate its utility, we engineered biosensors for gut malabsorption, a condition characterized by increased luminal osmolality. Using identified osmolality-responsive native promoters from B. theta, we made biosensors capable of detecting changes in gut physiology through graded fluorescent outputs. These biosensors were validated both in vitro and in vivo using a murine model of laxative-induced malabsorption, where they enabled continuous, long-term, non-invasive monitoring of single-cell response from fecal samples with sensitivity to subclinical malabsorption levels. By expanding the genetic toolkit for Bacteroides and demonstrating its use in a physiologically relevant context, this approach highlights the potential of engineered gut bacteria as a monitoring platform for diverse gut health applications.

We addressed this question by training common marmosets to perform a foraging task in a semi-naturalistic environment, where they retrieved food from eight dispensers over multiple sessions. Animals received no instruction or shaping and were free to visit dispensers in any order. We found that animals engaged with the task in most trials and, within engaged trials, transitioned from exploratory to efficient foraging behavior. Learning was marked by performance gains and the emergence of reproducible movement patterns between specific dispensers. Using trajectory analyses and probabilistic modeling, we found that animals formed stable route segments linking specific dispensers, reflecting the emergence of local navigation motifs. These segments became increasingly regular and predictable with experience. Yet rather than being rigidly replayed, they were flexibly recombined into variable global sequences. This indicates that animals adopted a hybrid navigation strategy, in which reusable route segments are embedded within a topological structure. These findings demonstrate how efficient, adaptive navigation can emerge through self-guided experience in complex environments. Our approach provides a naturalistic and longitudinal framework for studying the formation of structured spatial strategies in non-human primates, bridging ecological behavior with theoretical models of learning and memory.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

However, despite advances in SLB preparation methods, it remains a challenge to robustly obtain fluid SLBs in which PIP lipids are both mobile and asymmetrically distributed. In this study, we report a simple and robust method to generate asymmetric SLBs containing tunable amounts of PI(4,5)P2. By dissolving PI(4,5)P2 below its critical micelle concentration (CMC), we enable its spontaneous insertion into the upper leaflet of SLBs exposed to bulk solution. The mobility of PI(4,5)P2 is confirmed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Furthermore, we demonstrate that PI(4,5)P2 incorporated using this method retains its functionality, recruiting binding partners, actin-membrane linker ezrin, and myosin 1 motors capable of sliding actin filaments on the SLBs.

Given the necessity of LIF during the acute recovery phase after injury, we hypothesized that intranasal (IN) LIF treatment would prevent neurodegeneration when administered during the chronic recovery period from a mild TBI (mTBI). Young adult male CD1 mice were subjected to a midline, closed-head frontal cortex injury using a flat metal impactor with a 3mm tip to induce a mTBI. In the 6-8 weeks post-mTBI, known to precede axonal atrophy in this mTBI model, two doses of 40 ng and 100 ng of LIF were administered twice daily, 5 days/week for two consecutive weeks. Sensorimotor functions were assessed at 4 and 8 weeks post mTBI, followed by ex-vivo brain magnetic resonance imaging at 9.4T and histopathology. mTBI mice showed sensorimotor deficits at 4 weeks, which worsened by 8 weeks post-injury. IN-LIF treatment prevented the progressive sensorimotor loss seen in the vehicle-treated controls. Increased mean diffusivity (MD) and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) were observed in the corpus callosum and prefrontal cortex of mTBI brains. In a dose-dependent manner, IN-LIF prevented the mTBI-induced MD increase and FA decrease.

Remarkably, mice lacking the host TMA receptor (Taar5-/-) have altered circadian rhythms in gene expression, metabolic hormones, gut microbiome composition, and innate behaviors.

Early detection of NINI and nID may enable interventions to restore neurodevelopmental homeostasis and reduce long-term impact. However, such diagnoses are impossible due to ethical reason to access to the central nervous system (e.g., lumbar puncture) when there is no suspicion of brain infection (e.g., meningitis). Methods: We refined a methodology to isolate and quantify inflammatory and iron-regulatory proteins in high-quality brain-derived extracellular vesicles (BDEVs) from human umbilical cord blood. A preclinical model was used to validate that BDEV contents reflect the brain microenvironment. We then applied this approach to evaluate biomarkers of NINI and nID in BDEVs isolated from cord plasma of newborns of mothers with obesity, a non-infectious pro-inflammatory gestational condition and a risk factor for nID. Findings: Plasma BDEV analytes correlated more strongly with brain analytes and showed stronger associations among functionally related molecules compared with whole plasma analytes. Maternal obesity induced an anti-inflammatory response in the brain compartment, a pro-inflammatory response in the periphery, and functional nID.

Such barriers may be sensitive to environmental conditions, and recent research has documented an increasing number of cases where anthropogenic environmental disturbance is associated with new hybrid populations. However, few studies have been able to quantitatively compare potential environmental drivers and test possible mechanisms connecting interspecific hybridization to anthropogenic disturbance. Here, we combine genomic and chemical surveys to explore the loss of reproductive isolation between the sister species Xiphophorus malinche and X. birchmanni, fishes whose riverine habitat in the Sierra Madre Oriental of Mexico is increasingly impacted by human-mediated disturbance. By sequencing whole genomes of thousands of fish, we characterize the landscape of hybridization between these species in four distinct streams. Ancestry structure varied dramatically across streams, ranging from stable coexistence to clinal hybrid zones, hinting that dynamics of hybridization in this system may be environmentally dependent. In one stream, a sudden shift in patterns of hybridization coincides with the stream's passage through an urbanized area, with upstream sites showing distinct ancestry clusters and downstream sites showing a swarm of hybrids with variable ancestry. Water chemistry measurements show that water quality changes significantly over this area, including in parameters known to disrupt fish olfaction and mating. We hypothesize that the hybrid swarm downstream of the town is driven by disruption of olfaction that impacts mating preferences. By sequencing mothers and embryos, we show that there is reduced assortative mating at sites downstream of the urbanized area compared to strong assortative mating at upstream sites. We identify alterations of the olfactory epithelium at the same downstream site which are consistent with chemical irritation from polluted waters.

Among these, cautious actions, where animals adjust their behavior in anticipation of predictable threats, are essential for survival. Yet, their underlying neural mechanisms remain less well understood than those of appetitive behaviors, where caution plays little role. Using calcium imaging in freely moving mice we show that glutamatergic neurons in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) are robustly engaged by contraversive movement during cue-evoked avoidance and exploratory behavior. Model-based analyses controlling for movement and other covariates revealed that STN neurons additionally encode salient sensory cues, punished errors, and especially cautious responding, where their activity anticipates avoidance actions. Targeted lesions and optogenetic manipulations reveal that STN projections to the midbrain are necessary for executing cued avoidance. These findings identify a critical role for the STN in orchestrating adaptive goal-directed behavior by integrating sensory, motor, and punitive signals to guide timely, cautious actions via its midbrain projections.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

U.; Shimada-Beltran, H.; Vega-Arreguin, J. C.", "abstract": "Phytophthora capsici is a destructive, broad-host-range oomycete responsible for substantial losses in global agriculture. While most transcriptomic studies have focused on host responses, the mechanisms by which generalist pathogens dynamically adapt their infection programs to diverse plant species remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comparative transcriptomic analysis of P. capsici during early-stage crown infection in four taxonomically and immunologically distinct hosts, Cucumis sativus, Cucumis melo, Capsicum annuum (CM334), and Solanum lycopersicum, via RNA-seq and multiphoton microscopy. Focusing on crown infections, the natural entry point for the pathogen, we reveal host-specific transcriptional programs that underpin differential infection strategies and outcomes. Our data show that P. capsici exhibits tightly regulated, host-dependent deployment of key virulence factors, including RxLR, NLP, and CRN, and elicitin effectors and reprograms its metabolism to exploit host-specific nutritional environments. In rapidly necrotizing hosts such as tomato, the pathogen induces glycolytic and fatty acid pathways while repressing immunogenic effectors. In contrast, cucurbits support prolonged biotrophic colonization, accompanied by the upregulation of carbohydrate metabolism and membrane transport genes. In the partially resistant chili pepper CM334, P. capsici shows signs of metabolic stress, cell wall remodeling, and effector repression, which is consistent with failed invasion. Functional validation via RNAi-mediated silencing of selected effectors revealed distinct roles in modulating virulence and host necrosis, confirming the functional relevance of the transcriptomic profiles. Co-expression network analysis uncovered discrete transcriptional modules associated with tissue-specific colonization, nutrient acquisition, and immune evasion. These results reveal how a generalist soil-borne pathogen finely tunes its gene expression in response to host-specific constraints, revealing conserved and host-specific transcriptional strategies that drive infection success or failure. This work provides mechanistic insight into adaptive virulence and expands our understanding of host-pathogen compatibility in eukaryotic microbes.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

D.; Sussman, C.; Rubinelli, L.; Maji, D.; Miller, R.; Thompson, A. T.; Campbell, D.; Walker, M. R.; Drozdz, M. M.; Liberatore, R. A.", "abstract": "Therapeutic proteins have seen a substantial increase in clinical development and use across many disease areas. Despite their broad applicability, significant drawbacks limit access to many of these drugs, including: i) high manufacturing costs; ii) administration via time consuming infusions; iii) frequent dosing, sometimes even daily; and iv) requirements for low temperature storage. MYO Technology was developed to overcome these barriers. The MYO Technology platform consists of therapeutic-encoding plasmid DNA (pDNA), and a proprietary medical device for intramuscular injection and delivery of electrical pulses. These pulses enable the in vivo electroporation of muscle cells and uptake of injected pDNA, leading to the production, secretion, and delivery of the therapeutic protein into peripheral circulation. MYO Technology offers several advantages over standard delivery of therapeutic proteins; pDNA manufacturing is a simpler and less specialized process compared to protein manufacturing, and pDNA is very stable and lacks most cold chain requirements. Furthermore, administration using MYO Technology takes only a few minutes, and the serum level of a therapeutic protein can potentially be maintained for many months without the need for redosing. Incretin receptor agonists (IRAs) are a class of therapeutic proteins that have recently come to prominence as powerful weight and glucose control drugs, and are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. Semaglutide and tirzepatide, currently the most widely used within this class, are both potent molecules, but have a short half-life, requiring weekly administration by subcutaneous injections. Moreover, since their clinical benefits rapidly disappear upon treatment cessation, T2D and obese patients may have a life-long dependency on IRAs, and the requirement for weekly injections can negatively affect the quality of life and the adherence to therapy, as well as create a significant financial burden. Therefore, increasing the interval between injections has become one of the major goals in the field. Here, we present our preclinical studies on the delivery of IRAs with MYO Technology. Animal proof of concept studies demonstrate that MYO Technology-delivered IRAs are functional, and efficacious in promoting long lasting weight and glucose control in mouse models of diet induced obesity. Moreover, engineering the IRAs to facilitate blood brain barrier penetration further enhances treatment efficacy, with benefits persisting well beyond six months following a single administration. Together, these findings highlight MYO Technology potential to transform care for patients with T2D and obesity by enabling long-lasting therapeutic effects with minimal dosing, ultimately improving quality of life and treatment adherence.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Our multi-dimensional dynamic phenotypes correlate exceptionally well with known gene functions, allowing us to identify many unknown roles of essential genes. Quantifying the relation between growth and cell size in turn identifies three distinct variants of the bacterial growth laws, which we explain mechanistically by discovering a new role for (p)ppGpp and SpoT as a sensor of translation elongation. Finally, we propose and systematically test an exceedingly simple, passive mechanism for the nutrient growth law, based on triggering cell division through the accumulation of a protein that, unlike ribosomes, is not controlled by (p)ppGpp. The resulting hyperbolic growth law fits the data from our three variants even better than the previously proposed exponential relationship, and with fewer parameters.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Understanding thermal physiology is critical for predicting how commercially and ecologically important populations could be affected by the increasing risk of rising temperatures. Heatwave risk assessments often examine extremities of time scales: immediate impacts or long-term consequences. However, little is known about how consistently increasing mid-term thermal stress shapes aerobic performance in commercially important species such as Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), which may face heat stress in rivers, especially at the juvenile life stage. By measuring how salmon juveniles manage their aerobic capacity at 16, 19 and 22 {degrees}C using intermittent respirometry, we test if their thermal performance curve shows a decline at temperatures commonly occurring during heatwaves. Whole-animal metabolism was measured from control individuals kept at 16 {degrees}C before and after the heatwave, and after 4-5 days exposure at 19 and 22 {degrees}C during the heatwave. We show that standard metabolic rate increases with temperature, but maximum metabolic rate and aerobic scope do not change between these temperatures. These findings suggest that juvenile Atlantic salmon may have limited capacity to increase aerobic performance during moderate heatwaves, leaving them vulnerable to cumulative effects of oxygen limitation to vital functions such as growth and stress responses. As climate change intensifies, incorporating thermal performance curves into conservation strategies can be utilized for predicting population resilience and informing effective management.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

CFTR-targeting therapies such as ivacaftor have transformed CF care by directly modulating CFTR function. However, the precise mechanism by which ivacaftor alters CFTR's conformational dynamics remains incompletely understood. In this study, we refined and employed a CFTR model derived from the phosphorylated, ATP- and ivacaftor-bound cryo-EM structure (PDB ID 6O2P). Through 32.5 microseconds of molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the structural and dynamic effects of the common F508del mutation and the gating mutations G551D, G1349D, and S549N. Our results show that mutations within the ATP-binding regions cause local rearrangements at the nucleotide-binding sites, affecting the interface between the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) relative to wild-type CFTR, rather than abolishing ATP binding entirely. We further indicate that, for the NBDs to approach one another productively, protonation of the aspartate side chains in G551D and G1349D CFTR may be necessary to mitigate charge repulsion. The F508del mutation induces increased rigidity within the protein core, impeding the rearrangement of transmembrane helices required for channel opening. Ivacaftor does not directly perturb the ATP-binding sites, consistent with emerging evidence that it exerts its effects allosterically on regions distal to the nucleotide-binding sites. Collectively, our findings enhance our understanding of CFTR dynamics and provide a versatile framework for exploring the molecular effects of disease-causing mutations and evaluating potential therapeutic agents.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

While growing clinical needs continue to drive advancements in the drug discovery space, current strategies primarily rely on searching large volumes of chemical data without addressing the specific contributions of molecular features. Moreover, both clinicians and researchers recognize the need for improving drug discovery methods and characterization that could aid in clinical strategy selection. To address these challenges, we offer a new perspective on targeted therapy development as well as interactome mapping, utilizing molecular fragments. The present study focused on therapeutic areas that represent emerging targets, namely JAK2 and GLP-1R, both of which have broad clinical potential. We developed a new self-adjusting neural network to capture drug features, which helped discover novel therapeutic candidates for the selected targets with improved binding. In addition, fragment-guided chemical space exploration allowed us to identify new metabolic trajectories that could support drug repurposing efforts and improve the prediction of side effects. Importantly, our work revealed that even a small compound library can effectively generate lead candidates, expediting the search and exploration process.

However, little is known about the evolution of these systems from a molecular perspective. In this study, we generated DArTseq data for 17 species of Harttia and one outgroup species (Farlowella sp.) to investigate the genomic architecture underlying sex chromosome evolution in this highly dynamic genus. The time-calibrated phylogeny based on 1,381 SNPs per species (24,858 SNP markers in total) revealed three well-supported clades, with divergence between clades occurring approximately 6 to 10 million years ago (Mya), coinciding with the formation of the Amazon River and several other river capture events in South America. The reconstruction of ancestral areas and karyotype, combined with the identification of shared and specific sex-linked markers, suggests that the Harttia ancestor occupied either the South and Southeast Atlantic drainages or the Eastern Amazon, with a karyotype of 2n = 58 and a homomorphic XY system. Our findings suggest a recent and independent emergence of two distinct multiple sex chromosome systems at ~5 Mya for X1X2Y and ~1 Mya for XY1Y2, which is associated with accelerated speciation rates in the genus.

Inflammatory activation drives phenotypic shifts in astrocytes that may compromise their ability to regulate cerebral blood flow. The capacity for inflammation-activated astrocytes to retain this regulatory function, however, remains unknown. To investigate astrocyte regulation of cerebral blood flow in AD brain and under systemic inflammation, we investigated astrocytic Ca2+ dynamics and functional hyperemia at rest and during brief and prolonged sensory stimulation in 12-month-old female APP/PS1dE9 mice. We further examined how a secondary systemic inflammatory challenge induced by low-dose, prolonged injection of LPS modulates astrocytic signaling and neurovascular function. AD mice exhibited elevated spontaneous but diminished stimulation-evoked astrocytic Ca2+ activity, accompanied by impaired sustained functional hyperemia, particularly within the capillary network. LPS-induced systemic inflammation further suppressed both spontaneous and evoked astrocytic Ca2+ responses and attenuated functional hyperemia.

Patch-clamp electrophysiology provides direct information on neuronal excitability, synaptic inputs, and ion channel function, making it a natural partner for SCP. However, combining these techniques introduces unique challenges: neurons must be both physiologically characterized and physically collected, and variability during retrieval from the brain slice can affect how faithfully proteomic measurements reflect in situ physiology. Here, we introduce a framework for interpreting patch-SCP outcomes that considers retrieval quality in terms of both the amount of material collected and the synaptic contents being recovered. Using a shotgun strategy in which all patched neurons were collected regardless of electrophysiological outcome, we systematically benchmarked the retrieval of pyramidal neurons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex. Capacitance measured during gigaseal-preserved retrieval correlated with protein identifications, providing a proxy for linking soma size to proteome yield. Preservation of neuronal spiking during relocation was associated with broader synaptic enrichment and recovery of transmembrane proteins. By comparison, torn or aspirated neurons produced small proteomes with poor synaptic representation and neurons with lost gigaseals or no recordings displayed variable outcomes that could still yield substantial molecular information. Together, these results establish shotgun patch-SCP as both proof-of-concept and a practical framework for linking neuronal physiology with proteomics in semi-intact circuits.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

A hybrid approach integrating individual and group- average FC outperformed both alone, particularly in symptomatic individuals and at finer spatial resolutions, the latter underscoring a critical but often overlooked role of spatial scale. Individualized FC also better captured individual tau topographies than canonical tau-PET maps derived from cohort-level data.

For samples collected within Vanuatu, spectral data were obtained from the acetone extract of both fresh and dried kava. The ANN predictive model was trained on geographical origin (countries or islands of origin), quality (noble vs tudei), and between different cultivars. ANN achieved near-perfect performance, with a generalized R-Square of 0.99 (training), 0.84 (validation), and 0.95 (test) for geographical origin prediction. Class-specific accuracy was 100% for Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, and Hawaii. The model achieved near-perfect internal prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.99) under repeated-measure validation. Due to the limited availability of independent Fiji samples, no blind-test validation was performed for that region. Thus, robustness claims apply only to regions with sufficient validation data. Significantly, the model demonstrated perfect classification (100% accuracy) for Malo and Santo Island kava samples, highlighting its ability to authenticate micro-regional origins within Vanuatu. For variety differentiation, ANN achieved 100% accuracy for noble versus tudei cultivars, ensuring compliance with Vanuatu's noble-only export policy.

To replicate biological perception, two approaches have emerged: artificial nervous systems that utilize soft electronics as biomimetic receptors to convert external stimuli into frequency-encoded signals, and biohybrid solutions that integrate living cells, plants, or even live animals with electronic components to decode environmental cues for life-like sensations. However, most current biohybrid approaches for artificial sensation are based on eukaryotic cells, which suffer from slow growth, stringent culture conditions, environmental susceptibility, and short lifespans, thus limiting their integration into practical wearables or robotic sensory skins. Here, we introduce fungi-based printable \"mycoelectronics\", which are created by additive bioprinting of living fungal mycelium networks onto stretchable electronics, as a practical living thermo-responsive sensory platform. This mycoelectronics approach leverages fungis capacity for rapid biological responsiveness, cultivability with exponential growth, stability and self-healing in ambient conditions, bioprintability for scalable manufacturing, and mechanical flexibility for seamless integration with soft electronics. Critically, we discovered that the thermal responsiveness of the fungal network arises from intrinsic cellular processes--specifically, heat-induced vacuole remodeling and fusion, which modulate ionic transport and thus the electrical conductivity of the mycelial cells and networks, enabling a rapid temperature response. By bridging the gap between cell biology and soft electronics, the mycoelectronics device with a living mycelium network functions as a thermal sensation system with rapid response and intrinsic self-healing properties, autonomously restoring sensing capabilities after damage or autonomously establishing sensor pathways in hard-to-reach locations.

PANKs 1-3 are feedback inhibited by the accumulation of acyl-CoAs. However, PANK2 can overcome this inhibition by binding palmitoyl-carnitine in vitro. Previous studies, conducted under glucose-replete conditions, have failed to detect a PANK2-mediated contribution to CoA synthesis since neither PANK2 deletion nor overexpression leads to changes in CoA cellular content. We found that exposure to BSA-conjugated palmitate (PAL-BSA) led to accumulation of both palmitoyl-carnitine and palmitoyl-CoA without evidence of lipotoxicity in HEK293T cells, suggesting that PANK2 was active under these conditions. Isotope tracing experiments with 13C15N-pantothenate showed a significant drop of de novo CoA [m+4] synthesis in PANK2 silenced (siPANK2) cells that was not observed in control or siPANK1 cells. Newly synthesized CoA in control and siPANK1 cells was able to sustain the high production of acetyl-CoA known to occur with metabolic switching to preferential fatty acid oxidation (FAO). In contrast, PANK2-deficient cells failed to increase acetyl-CoA production during PAL-BSA, indicating that FAO is limited by CoA availability in these conditions.

Understanding the evolution of traits influencing ontogeny is challenging because their fitness effects unfold across an individuals lifetime and may differ between classes such as sexes. Here, we analyze selection on non-plastic traits (e.g., fixed resource allocation strategies) that determine the development of dynamical states throughout life (e.g., body size), with consequences for fecundity and survival in age- and class-structured populations. Using invasion analysis, we derive expressions for directional and quadratic selection that decompose into age- and class-specific components. This allows us to identify convergence stable trait values, assess whether they are uninvadable or potentially experience evolutionary branching, and pinpoint the age and class pathways through which correlational and disruptive selection act. Applying our results to a model of growth under size-mediated sexual selection, we show how developmental trade-offs and sex-specific constraints can generate disruptive selection on male growth and favour the evolution of alternative male life histories. More broadly, our results highlight how adaptation is mediated by the interaction of development and demography, and provide tools to investigate how conflicts across ages and classes influence senescence, sexual dimorphism, and the diversification of ontogenetic strategies.\n\nAuthor SummaryHow does natural selection shape traits that influence how organisms develop through their lifetime? This question is difficult because the effects of such traits unfold dynamically as individuals change in states such as size or condition, which in turn influence survival and reproduction throughout life. We developed a mathematical model that follows these causal links and characterises the gradual evolution of developmental traits. Our results apply to populations with different classes, such as males and females, that follow distinct developmental and demographic paths. Our model reveals when selection is stabilizing, holding populations fixed for an optimal trait value, and when it is disruptive, favouring trait diversification into alternative life-history strategies. As an illustration, we analyse the evolution of sex-specific growth under size-based sexual selection. We show how developmental trade-offs and demographic differences can generate disruptive selection on male growth, leading to the coexistence of fast-growing short-lived males and slow-growing long-lived ones. More broadly, our results link development, demography, and adaptation, and show how their interplay shapes biological diversity both within and between populations.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Yet why the dominant limb performs better across a range of motor skill-requiring tasks remains unanswered. Is it because of an intrinsic hemispheric advantage or instead is it the result of life-long practice with the dominant side? We tested these alternatives using two tasks. The first was 3D reaching with either an inertial challenge or the need to use a stick-like tool. The second required participants to write with their dominant and non-dominant elbows. We applied a novel geometric analysis to quantify movement-trajectory shape. We show that (1) tool-use unmasks markedly inferior control in the non-dominant arm, and this is because tools impose the need to generate unfamiliarly shaped movement trajectories; and (2) there is no general dominant limb motor control advantage, only task-specific experience or practice. These results reframe dominance as predominantly about learned control of tool kinematics rather than baseline asymmetry in control of limb dynamics.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Jackals may act as reservoirs for pathogens such as Lyme disease and babesiosis, affecting wildlife, humans, and pets. Their close genetic relationship with domestic dogs also increases the risk of hybridization and host-jumping, complicating disease dynamics.\n\nTo better understand their dispersal ability and host-pathogen dynamics, we present the first chromosome-level genome assembly of the golden jackal, generated using PacBio HiFi sequencing and reference-based scaffolding. The final assembly has a total length of 2.53 Gb in 325 scaffolds, with 98.41% of the sequence anchored to the expected 38+XY chromosomes. The assembly shows high contiguity, with scaffold and contig N50 values of 68.03 Mb and 56.64 Mb, respectively. Annotation revealed 26,084 protein-coding genes, and repetitive elements account for 40.58% of the total assembly.\n\nThis high-quality reference genome provides an essential resource for studying the genetic basis of the golden jackals adaptation, ecological interactions, and potential as a zoonotic reservoir.

We propose a normative framework, based on linear reinforcement learning, that redefines dopamine's computational objective. We propose that dopamine optimises not just cumulative rewards, but a reward value function augmented by a penalty for deviating from a default behavioural policy, which effectively confers value on controllability. Our simulations show that this single modification enables optimal value composition, fast and robust adaptation to changing priorities, safer exploration in the context of threats, and stable learning amid uncertainty. Critically, this unifies disparate striatal observations, parsimoniously reconciling threat and action prediction error signals within the striatal tail.

Women who experience early menopause face an accelerated physiological aging rate, along with impaired memory and increased risks of neurodegenerative diseases. However, it remains elusive how the timing of menopause affects brain activity, which could be crucial for understanding menopause-related acceleration of aging and increased risk of dementia. Recent studies have revealed a highly structured infra-slow (< 0.1 Hz) global brain activity across species and linked it to arousal and memory functions, as well as waste clearance in Alzheimers diseases (AD). In this study, we examined how this global brain activity relates to age of menopause using resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project-Aging dataset. We found that women who experienced earlier menopause (mean menopausal age 45{+/-}3.5 yr) exhibited weaker global brain activity (p = 5.0x10-4) with reduced coupling to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow (p = 0.017) compared to age-matched later-menopausal women (mean menopausal age 54{+/-}1.2 yr). Differences appeared mainly in higher-order brain regions, where activation levels correlated with memory performance in earlier but not in intermediate or later menopausal women. These findings highlight brain activity changes linked to early menopause, suggesting a potential mechanism underlying memory decline and the increased risk of AD and dementias in early-onset menopausal women.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Although P. falciparum encodes a putative DGAT (PF3D7_0322300), its role in the parasite life cycle has not been elucidated. We generated conditional PfDGAT-knockout parasites to investigate the enzyme's functional significance. PfDGAT deficiency led to parasite death, accompanied by reduced LD formation, elevated phospholipid levels, and induction of ER stress. Moreover, PfDGAT deletion altered protein trafficking, resulting in the decreased cytoadherence of parasite-infected erythrocytes to human brain microvascular endothelial cells, and suppressed parasite sexual differentiation. Thus, PfDGAT deletion affected multiple aspects of the parasite's life cycle, highlighting its critical role in parasite survival and pathogenesis.

This data-driven pattern learning approach identifies two principal axes of brain-body associations in both biological sex groups. The first axis is driven by the dominant contribution of age. Across multiple brain measures, aging is associated with loss of brain structural integrity and cerebral vascular dysfunction. The second axis is driven by metabolic features, characterized by low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, elevated body mass index, blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin, glucose, and alanine aminotransferase, and reduced cerebral blood perfusion. Finally, we show that deviations from a healthy metabolic profile are linked to cognitive deficits, particularly in females.

This capability provides a quantitative window into increasingly broad regions of the vast combinatorial fitness landscape---well beyond those explored by natural evolution. While identifying a few engineered variants that survive under extreme selection is valuable, quantitative mapping of the fitness landscape requires accurate inference of growth rates for the entire variant population. Here, we revisit three established approaches for estimating growth rates from sequencing count data: least-squares fitting, maximum likelihood estimation, and variational Bayesian inference. In contrast to previous treatments, we introduce the softmax transformation to link the probabilistic model of counting noise to the deterministic model of variant growth. By clearly delineating these two modeling components---jointly required for inferring growth rates from time-resolved sequencing counts---we show how to replace exponential growth with any alternative model defined by a small number of variant-specific parameters. While we illustrate this flexibility using the logistic and Gompertz models of growth, application to more mechanistic models, in which growth rates are expressed in terms of microscopic biochemical parameters, will open the door to high-throughput inference of fundamental kinetic and biophysical constants from sequencing data.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Germline variants may influence TR gene function and subsequent usage, highlighting the importance of accurate TR allele profiling. However, accurately identifying germline TR from standard WGS data remains challenging due to short read lengths, limited depth, and high sequence similarity. To address these challenges, we developed gAIRR-wgs, for WGS-based TR allele typing. By incorporating novel alleles from HPRC individuals, gAIRR-wgs exhibited excellent performance in allele calling, with F1 scores of 100.0% for TR_D, 99.8% for TR_J, and 98.3% for TR_V. Applying this pipeline to 1,492 individuals from the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), we identified 449 novel TR alleles, 277 of which overlapped with HPRC release 1 data of mixed ethnicity and are absent in the IMGT database. Further population comparison analysis revealed significant TR allele distribution differences across global populations, showing population-specific patterns and diversity variations between ethnic groups. We also discovered TWB-specific deletion polymorphisms affecting contiguous TRGV and TRBV genes, which are not recorded in the gnomAD database and undetected by standard structural variant callers, highlighting the need for tailored approaches to resolve complex immune gene regions.

Generative network models (GNMs) aim to uncover the principles underpinning the organisation of connectomes by creating synthetic networks according to simple computational rules. These models capture the connectome's topology, operationalised here as the overall distributions of network metrics (e.g., modularity, small-worldness, rich-club structure). However, they typically ignore the differential timing of connectivity formation. By omitting this temporal programme, GNMs often misplace topological features in physical space. Here, we add a heterochronous growth term to GNMs and use a new model fitness function that weighs topology and topography equally. Topography refers to the spatial embedding of the network, the actual anatomical positions of tracts. With these advances, we can generate synthetic networks that more faithfully reproduce the spatial layout of diffusion-MRI connectomes from two independent adult cohorts.

Electrophysiology studies in FMR1-knockout (KO) mice previously observed hyperexcitability at the auditory cortex (AC), with enhanced neuronal firing to auditory stimuli. Prepulse inhibition (PPI), a behavioral measure of sensorimotor gating, is robustly impaired in FXS individuals. Interestingly, a related paradigm called gap-induced inhibition of the acoustic startle (GPIAS) is mediated by the AC, and a previous study observed decreased GPIAS in mature FMR1-KO mice. Further, habituation is also an important sensory filtering mechanism, which has been reported to be impaired in mature FMR1-KO mice. However, not much is known about GPIAS and habituation in FMR1-KO mice during early development. Methods: We evaluated GPIAS in male and female FMR1-KO mice at post-natal days 15 (P15), 20 (P20) and 30 (P30). The paradigm consisted of a prepulse stimulus (a gap in a continuous background noise) followed by a startle stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval of 50 or 100 ms. Habituation was assessed prior to the GPIAS trials, with a series of startle only stimulus. Results: We observed a trend for genotype difference in acoustic startle response (ASR) magnitude, particularly in the female mice at P30. No significant genotype differences were noted in GPIAS or latency of ASR. Response duration was significantly increased in the male FMR1-KO mice compared to their WT counterparts during early development. Significant genotype differences were also observed in habituation and sensitization. In terms of development, we observed a significant increase in GPIAS with maturation. Furthermore, we also observed significant changes in the magnitude, response latency and duration of ASR with maturation. Finally, significant sex differences were observed in ASR magnitude and duration. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that behavioral responses to auditory stimuli are dynamic during development and differ between females and males, an important consideration for future study design. Additionally, the FMR1-KO mice display habituation deficits during early development, which could be an ideal window for addressing auditory hypersensitivity in FXS.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

By applying temporal generalization to phonetic descriptor decoding, we can disentangle whether potential phoneme processing deficits are due to the maintenance of phonemes in verbal short-term memory and/or inferred differences in phonetic processing speed, both of which are thought to be impaired in dyslexia. We investigated whether phonetic processing depends on the phoneme's position or its lexical competition. Our results reveal two key findings that may help explain the challenges faced by children with dyslexia. First, these children exhibit reduced decoding accuracy for word-onset phonemes, suggesting disruptions in either predictive, word-level anticipatory mechanisms or in the intrinsic rhythmic processing aligned with word boundaries. Second, they exhibit increased decoding accuracy for non-onset phonemes with low lexical competition approximately 400 ms after phoneme onset. This pattern suggests that children with dyslexia retain linguistically less relevant sounds longer in verbal short-term memory and process them more slowly compared to their typical reading peers.

A.", "abstract": "The role of the hippocampus in resolving memory interference has been greatly elucidated by considering the relationship between the similarity of visual stimuli (input) and corresponding similarity of hippocampal activity patterns (output). However, these input-output functions can take surprisingly different forms. Here, we reconcile seemingly conflicting findings by considering the possibility that the hippocampus prioritizes different dimensions of visual similarity across different stages of learning. First, we generated a set of natural scene images from two visual categories and rigorously characterized visual similarity using a wide array of methods: neural networks, artificial intelligence models, and human perceptual and memory decisions. We then identified two orthogonal dimensions of visual similarity that each predicted memory interference, but that did so at distinct stages of learning. Using high-resolution fMRI, we then tested for dimension-specific input-output functions within the hippocampus. Within CA3 and dentate gyrus (CA3/DG), we show that dimensions of visual similarity were inverted (negative functions) at stages of learning when they contributed to memory interference. When the dimensions did not contribute to interference, functions were positive. These findings reveal that hippocampal representations of visually-similar stimuli are highly dynamic and critically depend on the dimensions of similarity that currently contribute to memory interference.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Although it spans only about 0.1% of the visual field, the foveola accounts for nearly one third of projections to the visual cortex. Accurate assessment of foveal function is therefore essential for monitoring visual processes and visual health. However, probing this region is challenging because of its minute size and the incessant eye movements that humans perform, even when fixating on a single point. Here, we leverage recent advances in eye-tracking and gaze-contingent display control to develop a visual field test capable of mapping foveal sensitivity with high precision and reliability. Applied to healthy observers, this method reveals substantial idiosyncratic variability both across and within individuals, with peak sensitivity consistently shifted toward the temporal visual field. By enabling high-resolution individualized assessment of foveal vision, this approach opens new avenues for both clinical diagnostics and basic research.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

D.; Andrews, B.; Sun, B.; Ren, S.; Lu, M.; Zhang, K.; Cooper, G.; Lu, B.; Chen, L.; Lu, X.", "abstract": "Background: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 plays a crucial role in breast cancer treatment. Despite clinical success, how ICB reshapes the tumor microenvironment (TME) to enhance anti-tumor activity remains unclear. Anti-PD-1 therapy alters TME cells beyond PD-1+ T cells, with extensive cell-cell communication (CCC) playing a key role. Understanding the dynamic CCC changes upon anti-PD-1 treatment can illuminate ICB mechanisms of action and TME dynamics. Methods: We analyzed single-cell RNA-seq data from 31 breast cancer patients before and after anti-PD-1 (pembrolizumab) treatment (Bassez et al., 2021). We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) induced by treatment in major cell types. We then applied an instrumental variable approach to uncover causal relationships between T-cell and non-T-cell DEGs. We further mapped ligand-receptor interactions mediating signal transduction between cells and constructed a CCC network from T to non-T cells. Results: Anti-PD-1 therapy induced widespread transcriptional changes across multiple cell populations. Key pathways modulated in T cells included NFkB, interferon-{gamma}, and interleukin signaling. CD4+ and CD8+ exhausted T cells engaged in distinct ligand-receptor interactions with tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and other types of cells, reshaping the TME. Our results indicated CD4+ exhausted T cells activated M1-like TAMs via TNF-TNFRSF1A and TNFSF14-LTBR, while CD8+ exhausted T cells engaged M1-like TAMs through ICAM1-ITGAL/ITGB2 and CCL8-CCR2, promoting anti-tumor immunity. Conversely, immunosuppressive interactions were also observed, such as TNF-TNFRSF1B (TNFR2) and TNFSF14-TNFRSF14 (HVEM) from CD4+ T cells, as well as CSF1-CSF1R and RPS19-C5AR1 from CD8+ T cells, which likely promote M2-like tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) polarization and contribute to pro-tumor immune regulation and resistance to therapy. Notably, key receptors in the causal CCC networks, such as C5AR1, TNFR2, and CSF1R, emerged as potential targets to enhance anti-PD-1 efficacy. Conclusions: These findings elucidate TME remodeling during anti-PD-1 therapy and underscore the pivotal role of CCC in treatment response. Our study identifies critical communication networks that may be biomarkers for immunotherapy responsiveness and highlights novel therapeutic targets, including C5AR1 and HVEM. Furthermore, our application of causal inference methodologies provides a robust framework for dissecting CCC mechanisms in immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Among the diverse cells orchestrating this regulation, specialized ependymal cells at the brain-blood interface called tanycytes have emerged as key modulators, yet the molecular mechanisms by which they influence surrounding cells remain poorly understood. Here, we identify Annexin A1 (ANXA1) as a tanycyte-derived anti-inflammatory signal whose expression, localization, and secretion are dynamically regulated by nutritional state and altered under high-fat diet. During positive energy balance, ANXA1 is secreted in CD9-positive extracellular vesicles (EV), remodeling hypothalamic networks by altering microglial morphology, synaptic density, and neuronal activation. These EV-mediated effects extend systemically to regulate brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, glucose homeostasis, and overall energy balance.

We aimed to reveal the subtype-specific expression of the CLPB gene in breast cancer, its effect on survival, and genetic/epigenetic alterations that might regulate the expression. Methods: Expression levels and prognostic signatures of CLPB gene in breast cancer patients were evaluated by using in-silico tools. RT-PCR and Q-RT-PCR methods are used to examine CLPB expression in cell lines. Genetic alterations of CLPB were revealed by employing Sanger Cosmic database. Combined bisulfite restriction analysis and UALCAN tool were used to examine the methylation status of the CLPB promoter in cell lines and samples, respectively. Results: CLPB expression is significantly higher in all breast cancer subtypes compared to normals, and it is associated with worse survival values. Genetic alterations of CLPB are rare. Cell lines express CLPB gene at moderate to high levels. The promoter region of CLPB is hypomethylated in samples and cell lines. Conclusions: We suggest CLPB gene as a therapeutic target and biomarker candidate in breast cancer.

Platinum signatures pervaded all tissues extensively, elevating mutation burdens of paediatric tissues to levels seen in adults.

M.", "abstract": "The Arp2/3 complex nucleates essential branched actin networks in most eukaryotes. Interestingly, the subunit Arp2 encodes two splice variants that differ merely by five amino acids in the D-loop, which is critical for actin polymerization. However, it is unknown if this alternative exon, or \"microexon,\" impacts Arp2/3 function or is even expressed. Here, we found that the Arp2 microexon has been evolutionarily retained for over 600 million years yet varies in sequence. We investigated the unique microexon in Drosophila Arp2 and found that the long splice variant encoding the microexon (\"Arp2L\") is expressed, though not as highly as the shorter variant (\"Arp2s\") in some tissues. We purified recombinant Drosophila Arp2/3 containing Arp2s or Arp2L and found no differences in actin polymerization rates in vitro. To test for functional divergence in vivo, we replaced Arp2 in D. melanogaster with the coding sequence of either Arp2s or Arp2L. Both splice variants fully rescue the Arp2-knockout lethality phenotype, yet they functionally diverge in sperm development, in which Arp2L-expressing flies exhibit defects in the alignment and motility of actin cones, structures that separate syncytial sperm. The microexon sequence, rather than the increased length of the D-loop, is responsible for cone defects. Despite these fitness costs, our evolutionary experiment suggests that encoding Arp2L provides an overall fitness advantage. These findings reveal that despite not exhibiting intrinsic differences in vitro, the Drosophila Arp2 splice variants are non-redundant in vivo, and the microexon sequence is likely specialized for tissue-specific roles.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

There is no convincing evidence that APC directs the degradation of other substrates. Using a reconstituted cytosolic extract-based system and complementary in vivo and cellular assays, we show that SREBP2, the master regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis, is a direct APC-AXIN1 substrate. APC-dependent SREBP2 degradation is conserved in Xenopus embryos, mouse colon, and human colorectal cancer cells and restricts SREBP2 target-gene expression, cholesterol synthesis, and tissue cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, APC and AXIN1 promote SREBP2 degradation via a conserved phosphodegron, which marks SREBP2 for ubiquitination by the E3 enzyme, FBXW7. Like {beta}-catenin, SREBP2 is stabilized by extracellular Wnt ligands; unlike {beta}-catenin, its regulation is independent of GSK3{beta} and CK1 and requires the entire APC mutational cluster region (MCR), whereas {beta}-catenin turnover can operate with only a partial MCR. These findings define a {beta}-catenin-independent branch of Wnt signaling that couples APC to sterol metabolism, providing a mechanistic rationale to target the mevalonate/SREBP2 axis in APC-mutant colorectal cancer.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Even weak signaling stabilizes short-lived expression states, and we derive mathematical expressions for the threshold signaling strength required to trigger tissue-wide stabilization.

Previous MPRA studies have screened thousands of functional SNPs associated with various complex traits and conditions. Most MPRA libraries utilize a single plasmid configuration, a single minimal promoter to drive expression, and a single-strand orientation, which may fail to capture the context-dependent activity of disease-associated cis-regulatory elements. We interrogate the potential regulatory differences introduced by variable MPRA plasmid promoters and positions. We used an MPRA library to quantify the activity of 1,305 pancreatic islet-derived transcription start sites generated from CAP analysis of gene expression profiling. We cloned fragments upstream or downstream of a reporter gene along with either the human insulin (INS) promoter or a synthetic housekeeping promoter (SCP1). We used elastic net regression to predict position-specific fragment activity based on enrichment of transcription factor binding site motifs, and generalized linear models to predict position-specific fragment activity from tissue-specific chromatin state regulatory annotations. Our results support the use of MPRA strategies that account for context-dependent factors when assaying candidate regulatory elements in pursuit of understanding complex genetic diseases.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Still, real-time visualization and quantification of this interaction remain technically challenging, especially across different host backgrounds. In this study, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of the nitrogenase system nifH promoter (PnifH) in driving expression of distinct fluorescent reporters; superfolder yellow fluorescent protein (sfYFP), superfolder cyan fluorescent protein (sfCFP), and various red fluorescent proteins (RFPs) within root nodules of determinate (Lotus japonicus-Mesorhizobium japonicum) and indeterminate (Pisum sativum-Rhizobium leguminosarum) systems. We show that PnifH-driven sfYFP and sfCFP yield strong, uniform, and reproducible fluorescence in nodules of both systems, facilitating reliable quantification of nodulation traits and strain occupancy. In contrast, RFPs including monomeric (mScarlet-I, mRFP1, mARs1) and multimeric (Azami Red1.0) variants exhibited weak or inconsistent signals in pea. Notably, fluorescent labeling did not impair rhizobial competitiveness for root nodule occupancy, and PnifH-driven sfYFP and sfCFP reporters enabled robust multiplexed imaging in single-root and split-root assays. In the lotus, mScarlet-I worked robustly and facilitated a tripartite strain labeling system. Complementing our molecular toolkit, we established a deep learning-based analytical pipeline for high-throughput, automated quantification of nodulation traits, validated against standard ImageJ analysis. Altogether, our results identify PnifH-driven sfYFP and sfCFP as robust, broadly applicable reporters for legume-rhizobia symbiosis studies, while highlighting the need for optimized red fluorophores in some contexts. The integration of validated promoter-reporter constructs with state-of-the-art computational approaches provides a scalable framework for dissecting the spatial and competitive dynamics of plant-microbe mutualisms.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Previously, we have developed a hidden Markov framework denoted by MagicImpute_mma for genotype imputation in a multiparental population, which was implemented in Mathematica. However, its computational time increases quickly with the number of parents. In this work, we extend MagicImpute_mma into MagicImpute for increasing computational efficiency and robustness to various types of errors. Particularly, it has the following novel features: (1) allowing for multiple multiparental populations that may be connected by sharing parents, (2) allowing for many missing parents that are not available for sequencing, (3) accounting for allelic bias and overdispersion in next generation sequencing data, (4) inferring marker-specific error rates and filtering for markers with low error rates, and (5) being implemented in the high performance Julia language. Besides extensive simulation studies, we evaluate MagicImpute by three real datasets: the rice F2 population with sequence depth being low, the apple F1 population with parents being outbred, and the sorghum multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population with 10 male sterile lines (out of 29 parents) being missing.

While haplotypes have been well studied in chronic infections like HIV and HCV, diversity remains under-explored in acute infections like dengue (DENV), which are constrained by a short viremic phase. This study aimed to characterise the mutation hotspots in DENV genomes at both consensus and haplotype levels. Near full length DENV genomes were sequenced using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) from the plasma of Sri Lankan patients with dengue fever recruited between 2017 -2020. Consensus sequences were mapped with Minimap-2, and haplotypes were reconstructed with Nano-Q, a tool designed for estimation of RNA virus haplotypes and their relative abundance. The genomic variability of DENV genomes was assessed by calculating Shannon Entropy (SE). Codons undergoing diversifying selection were identified with three phylogenetics-based algorithms (FEL, MEME, FUBAR) implemented within the Datamonkey suite. From 150 samples tested, both consensus and haplotype sequences were characterised in 90 samples (DENV1: 8, DENV2: 51, DENV3: 31). The genomic variability of consensus sequences measured by SE was higher in DENV2 compared to DENV3, and the reverse was true for haplotypes. At the consensus level, the NS2A gene had the greatest number of mutable sites when adjusted for gene length across all serotypes, while at the haplotype level the NS1 gene had the same. Overall, the haplotypes sequences revealed more sites with high mutability and codons under diversifying selection than those visible at consensus level. This provides proof-in-principle that in acute RNA viruses also have high mutability in haplotypes, which may be inapparent with a consensus-level analysis.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

For two commonly traded species requiring UK CITES Article 10 (A10) Certificates we collected data on the frequency of reporting of the correct paperwork. We did so on two UK websites that vary in their format: one contains both a free text field and a tick box to capture information on CITES Certificates, the other contains solely a free text field. For each species the tick box captured A10 Certificate ownership in 99% of advertisements, which was significantly higher than that reported in the free text field of the same website. Further, the presence of a tick box also encouraged higher reporting of A10 ownership in the free text field, with a significant difference between websites.

B.", "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key modulator of synaptic function, acting through activation of TrkB receptors. This neurotrophic factor mediates synaptic plasticity and plays an important role in epileptogenesis, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In this work, we investigated the role of BDNF-TrkB signaling in the regulation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors (NMDAR), and the impact on network synchronization in cultured hippocampal neurons . Incubation with BDNF increased the synaptic surface expression of GluN2A-containing NMDAR in rat hippocampal synaptoneurosomes and in cultured hippocampal neurons. The effect in the latter preparation was time- dependent and required new protein synthesis. Mechanistically, we identified a signaling cascade involving hnRNPK, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Pyk2, and protein kinase C (PKC) as essential for mediating BDNF - induced upregulation in the synaptic expression of GluN2A-containing NMDAR. Knockdown of hnRNPK or Pyk2, pharmacological inhibition of PKC, or expression of a phosphorylation -deficient Pyk2 mutant abolished BDNF-induced synaptic surface accumulation of Glu2A. Moreover, Pyk2 phosphorylation at Y402 was necessary for both basal and BDNF-induced synaptic GluN2A expression. Functional multielectrode array (MEA) recordings showed that endogenous BDNF and GluN2A-containing NMDAR contributed to the increase in network activity in cultured hippocampal neurons evoked by stimulation with a cocktail including bicuculline, 4-aminopyridine, and glycine. Importantly, BDNF-TrkB signaling also mediated the upregulation in the hippocampal synaptic surface expression of GluN2A -containing NMDAR, as determined in rats subjected to the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy, where increased GluN2A synaptic expression was observed and shown to be TrkB-dependent. These findings unveil a crucial BDNF/TrkB-PKC-Pyk2-hnRNPK signaling axis that regulates synaptic GluN2A levels and network excitability, offering novel insights into the molecular basis of synaptic plasticity.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

This study aims to evaluate the brain protective efficacies of a novel intestinal cooling (CC) technique relative to the body surface cooling (SC) and the normothermic (NT) condition in a mouse stroke model. Methods: Mice were randomly assigned to CC (n=13), SC (n=15), or NT (n=11) groups. They underwent 60 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 7-day reperfusion. Both head and intra-colon temperatures were maintained at 37{degrees}C for 30 min before, during, and 30 min after MCAO. At 30 min reperfusion, a cooling catheter was placed to maintain intra-colon at 37{degrees}C in NT or 12{degrees}C in CC. The head temperature was maintained at 37{degrees}C in NT and 30{degrees}C in CC. In SC, both intra-colon and head temperatures were maintained at 30{degrees}C. Cooling lasted 3 hours. Bodyweight, behavioral deficits (nesting and pole test), and survival rate were assessed post-MCAO. At day 7 post-MCAO, mice were perfusion-fixed for histopathological analysis. Results: Post-stroke histopathological brain injury areas and volume were significantly reduced in CC, and appeared reduced though not statistically significant in SC, relative to NT. Compared with NT, body weight, nest building activity, and pole test were all significantly recovered in CC post-MCAO. In SC, only nest building improved significantly, while body weight and pole test showed marginal, nonsignificant trends. Consistent with functional recovery, survival was significantly improved in CC but not in SC, compared with NT. Conclusion: In a murine model, our novel CC technique successfully achieved targeted intestinal cooling while preserving safe upper-body temperatures necessary for normal cardiopulmonary function. Targeted intestinal cooling provides significant benefits superior to SC and NT, including smaller stroke volume, fewer functional deficits, and lower mortality rates, thus supporting the novel concept that the intestines are potential therapeutic targets for stroke management.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

B.; Zylka, S.; Prieto-Godino, L. L.; Ruta, V.", "abstract": "Mating decisions are often attributed to the sensory signaling between prospective sexual partners. Yet these interactions are also shaped by the broader environmental context in which they unfold, to appropriately align sexual arousal with reproductive opportunities. Here we show that in the host specialist Drosophila erecta mating is strictly contingent on the ecological and social environment generated as flies densely aggregate on a food patch. We find that food volatiles directly promote male sexual arousal, triggering individuals to sample and pursue potential mates, giving rise to dynamic interactions across the group. The ensuing visual motion transforms each male's visual field, which in turn further amplifies his arousal, generating a multisensory feedback loop that coordinately promotes courtship across individuals. D.erecta's strict dependence on environmental cues appears latent in related species, such as D. melanogaster, where food odor can promote arousal but is dispensable for vigorous courtship. Comparative circuit analyses reveal that species-specific thresholds for sexual arousal reflect variation in how olfactory input modulates conserved nodes controlling courtship drive, rendering food volatiles a strict sensory gate only in D. erecta. Together, our findings highlight how ecological cues not directly tied to sexual signaling can profoundly influence reproductive behavior and reorganize the social landscape to ensure mating occurs in contexts where reproductive opportunities are abundant.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

We performed protein clustering using a structure-informed approach integrating AlphaFold models with sequence information to classify and functionally annotate the ORFan-rich mimivirus proteome. To map the protein-protein interaction network during morphogenesis, we employed endogenous tagging and co-immunoprecipitation coupled to mass spectrometry.

Variants were assessed in pfcrt, pfmdr1, and pfk13, and copy number variation in pfpm2 and pfpm3, including detection of the pfpm2/3 hybrid. High coverage enabled the detection of both dominant and minority alleles. Among the 99 isolates, the pfmdr1-NFD haplotype was found in 6% (6/99, all likely originating from Venezuela), pfcrt-C350R in 7% (7/99), and pfpm2 and pfpm3 amplifications in 5% (5/94) and 6% (6/97), respectively, and the pfpm2/3 hybrid in 4% (4/99). No validated or candidate pfk13 mutations associated with artemisinin partial resistance were detected. This study provides the first report of the pfpm2/3 hybrid and the pfmdr1-NFD haplotype in Brazil, and confirms the presence of pfcrt-C350R in isolates from the tri-border area. These variants, associated with reduced susceptibility to lumefantrine and piperaquine, suggest that parasites in northern Brazil already carry resistance markers that are prevalent in neighboring countries.

The clinical strain used for this analysis carried a 10-nucleotide deletion mutation in pncA (positions 118-127) that abolished PZA activation, identified in our previous study. The critical drug concentrations were established at 200 {micro}g/mL for the clinical strain (CST) and 12.5 {micro}g/mL for the H37Rv strain (RvT), with the untreated H37Rv strain (UTRv) used as a reference.

Analysis revealed 3,413 differentially expressed genes (padj [&le;] 0.05), including 1,428 upregulated and 1,360 downregulated genes. Functional enrichment was predominantly detected in CST vs. RvT followed by CST vs. UTRv, whereas no significant enrichment emerged in RvT vs. UTRv, underscoring the mutations dominant influence on the pyrazinamide response. The ribosomal machinery genes rplC, rplD, and rpsH were significantly enriched and strongly upregulated in the mutant strain under treatment but only mildly regulated in the laboratory strain.

It is not completely understood why lactic acid bacteria (LAB) consistently drive the spontaneous fermentation of vegetables such as cabbage and carrots and how variables such as vegetable substrates, salt addition, and carbon dioxide levels can impact microbial community dynamics. Here, we explored the temporal microbial dynamics in standardized fermentations of 11 different vegetables (including beetroot, bell pepper, cabbage, carrot, cucumber, fennel, green asparagus, leek, parsnip, sunroot, and tomato), revealing a consistent dominance of Leuconostoc and other LAB. Additionally, we investigated the impact of varying salt concentrations, demonstrating that lower salt levels resulted in a delayed appearance of the typically dominant LAB community, while simultaneously revealing a higher abundance of Weissella and various Enterobacterales taxa. These effects imposed by reduced salt concentrations were mitigated by CO2 injection, which reverted the enhanced Enterobacterales levels and increased the overall abundance of Lactobacillales.

In the environmental bacterium Pseudomonas putida, CrcB export is the primary defense against fluoride stress. Yet, spontaneous NaF-tolerant mutants emerge even without this transporter, suggesting the existence of additional pathways. To uncover these mechanisms, we performed a genome-wide screen of over 141,000 transposon mutants.

An infection leads to symptoms such as rubbery and non-processable tubers and consequently to substantial decreases in yield and tuber quality as well as to abandonment of seed potato production in affected areas. Up to date, resistant potato varieties are not yet known, and the tool box of integrated pest management to prevent the spread of P. leporinus as causal vector is quite limited. Mortality experiments designed as no-choice trials on potato cultivar Gala (Solanum tuberosum) and on its wild relative S. bulbocastanum revealed significant effects of the latter on the survival rate of the vector. LC/MS analysis of the insects and their intestines showed that acyl solamines were retrieved only in individuals from the S. bulbocastanum plants. Furthermore, choice-tests were carried out to study the vector behavior. A preference towards S. bulbocastanum vs. S. tuberosum Gala was observed despite its lethal effects. Volatile organic compounds of the two different species were collected and analyzed by GC/MS. The two profiles differed in 39 of 80 compounds. The wild potato species S. bulbocastanum and its compounds are discussed as potential starting points for further research on sustainable management of P. leporinus.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have shown that spontaneous fluctuations in visual attention are associated with ESS, and that ESS and ISS are negatively correlated, consistent with the temporal renormalization theory. However, it remains unknown whether controlled manipulations of visuospatial attention can causally modulate ESS and ISS in opposite directions via distinct neural mechanisms. To address this question, we conducted two complementary EEG experiments. In Experiment 1, ESS was assessed using a spatially cued beep-flash synchrony judgment task and the point of subjective simultaneity (PSS). In Experiment 2, ISS was measured using fusion and fission variants of the sound-induced flash illusion, with the peak illusion rate (PIR) as the behavioral index. This dual-paradigm design enabled direct comparison between explicit and implicit synchrony under matched attentional manipulations. Behaviorally, asymmetric allocation of visuospatial attention between auditory- and visual-leading conditions induced opposite shifts in PSS and PIR, specifically in the fusion variant. At the neural level, prestimulus frontal theta oscillations were associated with variations in PSS, whereas bilateral frontotemporal and left posterior beta oscillations were associated with variations in PIR. These results demonstrate that visuospatial attention exerts opposite modulatory effects on ESS and ISS through distinct oscillatory dynamics, providing causal evidence for the temporal renormalization theory and advancing understanding of how attentional control shapes multisensory temporal binding.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Here we report a rapidly absorbable, ultra-long acting, and glucose-responsive insulin analogue via engineering recombinant human insulin with two phenylboronic acids. The insulin analogue has a long circulating half-life (t1/2{beta} ~150 h) due to its unique, unprecedented, glucose-responsive binding to blood circulation-associated proteins. This interaction drives the formation of a unique systemic reservoir that allows synchronised dynamic response in insulin levels to glucose fluctuations. In type 1 diabetic mice and minipigs, a single subcutaneous dose can maintain normoglycaemia for over one week (47.5-fold compared to insulin glargine). After the last injection of four consecutive weekly administrations in mice, the glucose-lowering effect can last 800 hours. Administering this glucose-responsive insulin analogue with a fully automated insulin delivery system can leverage dual closed loops and achieve a glucose time in range of over 85% and a coefficient of variation of approximately 30%, better than the recommended targets for human therapy.

This study examines the role of microRNA-21-3p in CCM-related cerebral hemorrhage and its underlying mechanisms. Methods: The expression of miRNA-21-3p and its target genes of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and pericytes were assessed in cavernous malformation lesions of 20 sporadic CCM patients by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The association of their expression with hemorrhage manifestation was evaluated. Cell proliferation, permeability, reactive oxygen species (ROS), migration, tubule formation, and the expression of NOX4 and VEGFA were assessed in CCM2 gene-depleted human BMECs and pericytes after miRNA-21-3p intervention. Cerebral hemorrhage, vascular permeability, vascular dilation, and angiogenesis after miRNA-21-3p intervention were evaluated in the ccm2 gene-knockdown zebrafish. Results: Decreased miRNA-21-3p and increased NOX4 and VEGFA were shown in BMECs and pericytes of the CCM lesions compared to peri-lesion normal vessels from epilepsy patients, which were also correlated with the presence of cerebral hemorrhage in CCM patients. Increasing miRNA-21-3p attenuated cell proliferation, permeability, ROS expression, cell migration, and tubule formation by targeting NOX4 and VEGFA in CCM2 gene-depleted BMECs and pericytes. In vivo studies revealed that increasing miRNA-21-3p reduced cerebral hemorrhage, vascular permeability, vascular dilation, angiogenesis, and the overexpression of nox4 and vegfa in ccm2 gene-knockdown zebrafish.

However, how dishonesty has an impact on the brain's dynamic alterations is still unclear. In this work, we attempt to understand the impact of immoral decisions on the brain states' dynamics using both resting-state and task-state fMRI data collected before, during, and after an information-passing task involving dishonest choices with rewards. We employed the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the changes in the brain dynamics state, in which the changes that happen between pre- and post-task are hypothesized to be linked to behavior and brain dynamics during the task. First, we identified 4 intrinsic brain states across both resting scans and task scans, including one reward state (state 1) and one control network (state 3). The fractional occupancy (FO) of the control network decreased after the task, and subsequent analysis showed that it was linked to brain dynamics during the task: as dishonesty persisted, FO of the control network decreased while FO of the reward network increased. Moreover, the post-task control network was negatively correlated with motivated dishonesty, suggesting that stronger control network recruitment counteracts immoral tendencies. In contrast, early in the task, the reward network positively correlated with motivated dishonesty, indicating that the representation and sensitivity to reward attribution were tied to dishonest choices. A complementary analysis using drift diffusion modeling confirmed that the reward network tracked the weightings placed on monetary rewards, and the level of activation of the reward network before the task is associated with a bias in dishonesty. Together, these findings suggest that the 'post-moral decision brain' operates not as a static system but as a set of dynamically shifting states, whose adaptive trajectories may underlie the lasting effect of moral erosion during sustained dishonest behavior.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated the effects of intravenous psilocybin and DMT on sleep-wake states and EEG spectral power and functional connectivity in rats. Experimental Approach: Sprague Dawley rats (n=25, 13 male) were surgically instrumented to record high-density EEG (27 electrodes) and EMG during 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle after intravenous psilocybin (2.5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg), DMT (3.75 mg/kg, 7.5 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline. The EEG/EMG data were scored in 4-second epochs into wake, slow-wave sleep (SWS), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. EEG spectral power and corticocortical coherence, a surrogate for functional connectivity, were computed in 12-second epochs. Key Results: Psilocybin and DMT delayed the onset of SWS and REM sleep, and caused a short-lasting increase in wakefulness and decrease in SWS. Psilocybin also produced a 1) decrease in REM sleep, 2) decrease in theta power and coherence and increase in high gamma power and coherence during wake and SWS, and 3) increase in high gamma coherence during REM sleep. DMT increased gamma coherence only during wakefulness. Conclusions and Implications: Serotonergic psychedelics have minimal effects on sleep-wake states. The enhanced high gamma functional connectivity suggests that the psychedelic-induced changes in EEG/neural dynamics can occur independent of the arousal states.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Previous reports using Shank3B knockout (KO) mice, a genetic model with relevance to ASD and PMDS, revealed deficits in social memory in adulthood, but the postnatal onset and mechanisms underlying this dysfunction remain unknown. In the hippocampus, area CA2 contributes to the emergence of social memory during development and remains important for this ability through the lifespan. Perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix structures, support social memory in CA2 and help orchestrate critical periods of plasticity in other brain regions. We found that Shank3B KO pups exhibit specific deficits in short-term social recognition and social novelty preference, which become evident at the end of the second postnatal week and persist into adulthood along with CA2 network aberrations. Excessive PNNs in area CA2 were detected in KO pups at the postnatal time when social recognition function typically emerges in healthy pups. This time was also characterized by greater sequestration of the guidance cue semaphorin-3A (sema3A) and overgrowth of afferents from the supramammillary nucleus (SuM) in KOs, suggesting that inordinate PNNs during a sensitive period may disorganize developing CA2 circuitry. Reduction of CA2 PNN levels prior to the onset of social dysfunction recovered social recognition function during development, as well as reduced sema3A and SuM inputs to the CA2. The restoration of behavioral function persisted into adulthood along with partial normalization of CA2 network activity. Together, these findings reveal how excess PNN formation in the developing hippocampus may give rise to impaired social memory by disrupting afferent input, effects that are reversible by early life intervention.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

We describe the generation of a mouse-adapted IBV strain that retains pathogenicity in mice when carrying hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) gene segments from a heterologous IBV strain. Serial passage of an influenza B reassortant virus, containing the HA and NA segments from B/Washington/02/2019 on a mouse-adapted B/Memphis/12/1997 backbone, resulted in the selection of an IBV that was highly pathogenic for mice. This mouse-adapted IBV strain had acquired non-synonymous mutations in 5 gene segments. Sequence analysis of the intermediate passages indicated that mutations in the matrix (M), polymerase acidic (PA), and polymerase basic 1 (PB1) gene segments appeared at passages 9 and 13, suggesting that these mutations contributed to the pathogenicity in mice. Mouse challenge studies with rescued reassortant viruses with one or multiple mutated gene segments, confirmed the importance of substitutions in the M and PA segments for pathogenicity.

LIM-domain only proteins (LMO) are also found to be associated with chromosomal translocation in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and are highly expressed in acute myeloid leukemia, where they correlate with poor prognosis. However, their role in myeloid cell lineage specification and function is poorly understood. Using Drosophila melanogaster, which possesses a single LMO homolog, Beadex (dLMO), and a conserved myeloid-like immune system, we have shown its conserved role in plasmatocytes (equivalent to macrophages) development and innate immunity. Beadex is expressed in progenitor and differentiated plasmatocytes, and its loss reduced lymph gland size, mature plasmatocyte numbers and phagocytic efficiency. The phagocytes of Beadex mutant flies feature reduced filopodia length and lamellipodium area. Mechanistically, Beadex regulates actin remodelling by regulating the expression level of profilin (chickadee/chic), as chic overexpression rescued the defect in phagocytosis. Overexpression of Beadex in hemocytes increased fly susceptibility towards Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium infection and this mortality was due to an infection-induced pathology independent of bacterial burden. Bulk RNA sequencing of Beadex knockdown hemocytes revealed transcriptional changes in actin cytoskeleton regulatory genes, phagosome function and immune response pathways. In conclusion, our study identifies Beadex as a key transcriptional regulator impacting multiple aspects of myeloid cell function, ranging from hematopoiesis and cytoskeletal dynamics to host-level immune defense.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

A.; Cougoule, C.; BERNUT, A.", "abstract": "Rationale: In cystic fibrosis (CF), caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, excessive neutrophilic inflammation drives lung damage and premature mortality. Current anti-inflammatory therapies have limited efficacy, partly due to an incomplete understanding of the mechanisms underlying CF-associated inflammation. Increased epithelial calcium signaling has been implicated, but how CFTR dysfunction perturbs the CFTR/calcium axis to promote inflammation remains unclear. Objectives: Using Cftr-depleted zebrafish and human approaches, we sought to i) define how CFTR dysfunction alters epithelial calcium signaling and promotes inflammation, and ii) assess whether calcium channel antagonists can attenuate inflammatory damage in CF. Methods and Results: We generated a transgenic zebrafish line expressing the calcium reporter GCaMP6 under an epithelial promoter to dynamically map epithelial calcium activity in vivo. Cftr-depleted zebrafish exhibited exaggerated epithelial calcium elevations following injury compared with wild-type animals. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) normalized epithelial calcium responses and reduced both oxidative stress and neutrophil recruitment. Among FDA-approved VGCCs antagonists tested, only verapamil promoted resolution of neutrophilic inflammation and improved tissue repair in CF zebrafish. Mechanistically, verapamil reduced aberrant epithelial calcium fluxes, ROS generation and NF-{kappa}B activation. These effects were confirmed in the human CF epithelial cell CFBE41o-, where verapamil reduced calcium and oxidative stress. Conclusions/ These findings establish dysregulated calcium signaling via L-type VGCCs as a pathogenic driver of inflammation in CF and identify verapamil as a promising therapeutic candidate. By restoring calcium and oxidative homeostasis, verapamil alleviates inflammatory damage, supporting its repurposing as a candidate anti-inflammatory therapy in CF.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

In the EHM, loss of peroxisome protein import and subsequent peroxisomal metabolic impairment trigger mitochondrial damage and compromise cellular respiration and energy production. Peroxisome dysfunction results in incoherent electrical conduction, defective Ca2+-handling, and ultimately presentation of a HF phenotype with pathological force generation.

However, SSCs are vulnerable to genotoxic drugs, and patients receiving chemotherapy face a high risk of germline instability and infertility. The molecular mechanisms and cellular pathways that choreograph SSC recovery after chemotherapeutic insult remain unknown. Previously, we identified SPRY4 as an ERK-dependent negative feedback regulator of growth factor signaling that is critical for preservation of stem cell activity in cultured mouse SSCs. Here, we demonstrate that following alkylating agent busulfan (BU)-induced injury, germline-specific Spry4 gene deletion (Spry4G-KO) reduces stem cell regeneration but promotes differentiation with rapidly enhanced nuclear ERK1/2 activity in undifferentiated (Aundiff) spermatogonia (including SSCs) in adult mice. Genes essential for stem cell maintenance, including Id1 and Cxcl12, were dysregulated by loss of Spry4. Furthermore, the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901, but not mTORC1 inhibitor Rapamycin, was sufficient to promote spermatogonial proliferation in Spry4G-KO testis 10 days post-BU treatment. Notably, the restoration of both spermatogonia pool and fertility was delayed in adult Spry4G-KO males long-term after injury. In summary, germline-specific deletion of Spry4 results in hyper-activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway in Aundiff spermatogonia, unleashing excessive spermatogenesis after germline damage, and ultimately impairing germline regeneration in adult males.

In New Caledonia where stocks are declining but giant clams retain an emblematic status, coastal communities have developed a traditional practice referred to as giant clam gardens, involving the translocation and aggregation of wild individuals onto shallow reef flats near villages. This study provides the first formal assessment of the prevalence, cultural significance, and potential ecological benefits of this practice. Surveys conducted in 11 coastal tribes documented over 40 clam aggregations primarily composed of Hippopus hippopus, which varied greatly in terms of age (1-40 years), area (1-1080 m2) and abundance (from a few individuals up to more than 2 700). Our findings suggest that the practice of giant clam gardens is now fairly widespread and primarily reflect a pragmatic approach aimed at optimizing resource access, rather than conserving the resource. Population surveys confirmed the presence of five giant clam species (H. hippopus, Tridacna maxima, T. squamosa, T. derasa and T. crocea), but failed to report significant recruitment in and around aggregations up to 1km downstream from the study area. This work revealed that while notions of protection and conservation were occasionally mentioned during interviews, they were not cited as primary motivations by communities. Nonetheless, clam gardens may contribute to broader population resilience by enhancing reproductive biomass and supporting larval dispersal across larger spatial scales. Given the declining state of natural stocks and the persistence of strong cultural ties to giant clam harvesting, this practice represents a pragmatic, culturally embedded approach that can provide valuable insights for strengthening the sustainability of this resource.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

This paper introduces SwimmingIndividuals, an open-source agent-based model (ABM) framework that advances our ability to simulate complex biological processes at large ecological scales. The software's main contribution is its suite of mechanistic sub-models that govern the full life cycle of each agent, including physics-based visual predation, adaptive behaviors such as diel vertical migration, and a flexible bioenergetics engine with multiple taxa-specific equations. These detailed biological processes are made computationally tractable for large populations through a hybrid CPU/GPU architecture written in the Julia language. We demonstrate the frameworks capabilities through three targeted simulations. The model successfully reproduced complex ecological phenomena as emergent properties, including diel vertical migration, cetacean diving patterns, size-based trophic dynamics, population-level growth curves, and stock-recruitment relationships. Furthermore, long-term simulations generated realistic population dynamics and quantified the impacts of different fishery harvest control rules. By coupling high-resolution biological realism with technical scalability, SwimmingIndividuals provides a powerful and flexible tool for a wide range of ecological inquiries. It can be used to conduct in-silico experiments into the ecosystem-scale impacts of environmental disturbances, test fundamental ecological theory, and evaluate the efficacy of complex, ecosystem-based management strategies.

Here we demonstrate that arbitrium-phages belonging to different species and genera can influence each other's infection dynamics by secreting similar communication peptides, leading to early lysogenisation of the signal-receiving phage, and elevated fitness of the signal-emitting phage. Antagonistic coevolution between signal emitting and signal receiving phages to manipulate each other's infection behaviours may explain the rapid diversification of arbitrium systems and their frequent horizontal exchange to escape the noise of cross talk.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Using comparative long-read sequencing in Drosophila ovarian somatic cells (OSCs), we show that the LTR transposon Springer rewires gene expression by inserting into promoter-proximal introns at an AT-rich motif. Its 5' LTR initiates transcripts that splice into host exons, expanding isoform diversity without adding coding sequence. We catalog 72 Springer-driven isoforms, indicating broad mutagenic potential. In parallel, the Flamenco (Flam) uni-strand piRNA cluster undergoes structural remodeling that replaces antisense transposon fragments with forward-oriented copies, reshaping piRNA populations and eroding silencing of specific elements, including Springer. This relaxation of somatic repression creates conditions permissive for germ-cell entry, providing a plausible route to heritable genome change. Thus, Flam plasticity, contrasting with the relative stability of dual-strand clusters, mechanistically links transposon activity to genome rewiring and evolutionary innovation.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Thg1 catalyzes an essential reaction adding a G-1 nucleotide to the 5' end of the tRNAHis, forming an identity element for tRNA aminoacylation. All TLPs studied, except Dictyostelium discoideum (Ddi) TLP2, perform in vitro Watson-Crick (WC) dependent addition of multiple nucleotides to repair truncated tRNA. DdiTLP2 has a similar activity to a Thg1 enzyme, adding G-1 to mt-tRNAHis, but shares other biochemical properties with other TLPs, including a restriction to making WC base pairs during this reaction. We identified two regions in DdiTLP2 that lacked residues that are absolutely conserved in other Thg1/TLP enzymes. DdiTLP2 variants in both regions abolish enzymatic activity of DdiTLP2, indicating these regions are important for DdiTLP2 catalysis. Complementary alterations to one of these residues (D150) in DdiThg1 caused an unexpected reversal of this enzyme's specificity, with a loss of its ability to incorporate a non-WC base paired G-1 to its physiological substrate, while gaining the ability to add WC base paired G-1 to mt-tRNAHis. These biochemical results, combined with structural models suggest a previously unknown role for D150 in controlling substrate specificity at the adenylation step by providing a checkpoint for correct setup of a WC base pair in the active site. Thg1 also appears to have adapted the role of the ancestral D150 residue for a second function, promoting non-WC nucleotide addition to its eukaryotic tRNAHis substrate.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

However, computational tools for metaHi-C remain fragmented and rarely offer end-to-end, comprehensive analysis, and existing pipelines use only chimeric Hi-C pairs while ignoring non-chimeric reads, which often constitute a large fraction of Hi-C libraries. Here, we present METAHIT, an accessible and modular workflow that standardizes metaHi-C from raw reads to genome-resolved outputs. The pipeline provides alignment-derived, assumption-light quality checks, integrates three state-of-the-art Hi-C-based binners by consolidating their outputs into a single, non-redundant metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) set, and, for the first time, reuses informative intra-contig read pairs that other Hi-C workflows discard by identifying shotgun-like reads with an EM model on gap distances and using them for per-bin reassembly. METAHIT also supports Hi-Cguided scaffolding, focused visualizations for scaffold structure, MAG annotation, and mobile genetic element (MGE)-host interactions. Across six habitats spanning host-associated and environmental microbiomes, METAHIT increases the recovery of near-complete and high-quality MAGs relative to established Hi-C baselines, while per-bin reassembly lowers contamination and maintains completeness. Applied to a single sheep-gut long-read metaHi-C sample, METAHIT recovered 929 high-quality genomes, representing, to our knowledge, the highest species richness reported from a single sample, and revealed expanded diversity within Erysipelotrichales. In the human gut, METAHIT improved contiguity for an abundant Bacteroides vulgatus MAG via Hi-C-guided scaffolding, identified candidate novel Faecalibacterium lineages, and resolved MGE-host links involving F. prausnitzii and the novel Faecalibacterium MAG.

Using Generation Scotland and case-control samples (n = 14,496 individuals), we screened 39 covariates for disease relevance and DNAm predictability, yielding system-relevant panels that were aggregated into scores. We compressed DNAm profiles with a protein-interaction-guided autoencoder, and trained health predictors on 128-dimensional embeddings using fully connected networks. On held-out samples, models reproduced the composite scores with strong rank agreement (Spearman {rho} = 0.87, R2 = 0.71 for respiratory health; {rho} = 0.82, R2 = 0.66 for cardiovascular; {rho} = 0.81, R2 = 0.64 for metabolic) and recover expected population structure in a generally healthy cohort, with clear separation between \"single-system low\" and \"multi-system low\" phenotypes, and graded coupling across systems without redundancy.

Based on the sequencing of a small targeted gene fragment, it is theoretically possible to identify a wide diversity of taxa by comparing them with reference sequence databases. However, a key challenge for accurate taxonomic classification is the incompleteness of such databases, leading to most query sequences lacking species-level matches. 2. Where species-level matches are missing, it may be possible to classify query sequences to a higher taxonomic level, such as genus or family, based on the similarity of related reference taxa. The challenge then lies in confidently recognizing whether the sequence belongs to an unobserved (here, \"novel\") taxon on a given taxonomic level. 3. In this study, we evaluated the performance and utility of several methods for taxonomic classification. Methods were assessed based on the classification accuracy of both observed and novel taxa, training time, space requirements, and run time. We did this for two cases: the COI barcode for arthropods, and the ITS barcode for fungi, with the latter representing an instance with substantially greater variation within classes. To test classification of novel taxa, we used well-curated datasets with partially distinct taxonomic distribution. Novel taxa were present at multiple taxonomic levels, including genera, families, and orders. We further assessed the effect on performance when shifting from full-length barcodes to shorter sequences as generated through metabarcoding in the testing dataset. 4. This study sheds light on the strengths and limitations of different classification algorithms across varied ecological contexts and provides valuable guidance for researchers in selecting suitable algorithms for DNA barcoding and metabarcoding applications. In particular, it demonstrates the supreme performance of phylogenetic placement methods such as EPA-ng for classification of COI barcodes, and composition-based classifiers such as SINTAX, RDP, and IDTAXA for ITS.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Most analyses have focused on these biomarkers separately, and simultaneous detection has not yet been attempted in high grade serous tubo-ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC). The aim of our study was to assess whether the tandem CTC/ctDNA approach increases HGSOC detection efficiency of peripheral blood liquid biopsy. Methods: For CTC detection, by using healthy donor samples spiked with known cancer cell numbers, we tested gene expression assays and TP53 next-generation sequencing (NGS). The latter was also applied for ctDNA detection where analytical validity was ensured by calculating the optimal variant allele frequency (VAF) threshold for mutation calling. The clinical validity of the assays was then verified on two HGSOC cohorts and respective controls. Standard 2x2 contingency tables and Wilson method were used to evaluate clinical validity, by calculating specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: High analytical sensitivity and specificity were found for both gene expression and TP53 NGS based CTC detection, as these assays specifically detected as few as five cancer cells spiked in control sample. Regarding clinical validity, the gene expression-based CTC detection showed 0.48 accuracy, 13.3% sensitivity, and 100% specificity, whereas TP53 sequencing demonstrated better assay performance (0.77 accuracy, 46.7% sensitivity, 100% specificity). For circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) analysis, we first identified 0.31% VAF cut-off for accurate ctDNA TP53 mutation calling. Subsequent clinical validity assessment showed solid performance efficiency of the ctDNA based liquid biopsy (0.71 accuracy, 60% sensitivity, and 100% specificity), outperforming the CTC detection methods. Importantly, the tandem ctDNA/CTC analysis improved disease detection rate in both HGSOC cohorts, allowing to achieve, respectively, 73.3% and 93.3% sensitivity. Interestingly, TP53 NGS revealed CTC private variants, and shared ctDNA/CTC mutations undetected in the primary tissue, highlighting the ability of the dual-analyte approach to capture tumor heterogeneity and allow mutation cross-validation. Conclusions: Our study reveals the complementary value of simultaneous CTC and cfDNA analysis in HGSOC, advancing the translational potential of liquid biopsy integration for the management of this disease.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we conducted a series of controlled queen monitoring experiments and surveys to understand the prevalence and viral loads of seven viruses across developmental stages of queens, drones, royal jelly, and workers from associated colonies. All viruses except SBV were detected, with BQCV, DWV-B, and LSVs showing consistently high prevalence. Eggs were frequently infected with LSVs, DWV-B, and CBPV, suggesting vertical virus transmission, and highlighting the importance of selecting healthy breeder queens. BQCV, on the other hand, dominated in queen larvae, pupae, and adult stages. Mated queens, particularly those maintained in bank colonies, exhibited higher prevalence and viral loads than virgin queens, with DWV-B and BQCV being most abundant. Worker bees from bank colonies also showed slightly higher viral loads compared to other colonies, indicating potential risks associated with queen banking. Drone samples revealed high BQCV and DWV-B prevalence, indicative of their potential role in venereal transmission. The results from hierarchical clustering and correlation analyses provided evidence that viral profiles of queens did not necessarily match those of their resident colonies, highlighting complex viral transmission dynamics.

H.", "abstract": "Canine feeding behaviour is strongly influenced by taste perception, yet the molecular determinants of palatability, particularly umami taste is unclear. Dogs typically consume food rapidly with minimal mastication, relying on a limited number of taste buds to detect sour, bitter, salty, sweet, and umami flavours. Amino acids are known to play a central role in canine taste, especially in diets rich in animal proteins. In this study, we aimed to identify the specific amino acids that optimally stimulate umami perception in dogs using a receptor ligand docking approach. A total of 27 canine specific taste receptors were identified from the UniProt database, comprising three umami, two sweet, five uncharacterized, and seventeen bitter receptors. All 20 naturally occurring amino acids were docked against these receptors using the CB Dock tool, and binding affinities were systematically analysed. Heat maps of binding energies revealed that tyrosine, tryptophan, arginine, histidine, phenylalanine, glutamine, glutamic acid, and lysine exhibited the strongest interactions with umami and sweet receptors, whereas bitter and unknown receptors showed comparatively weaker affinities. Binding energy ratio analyses further confirmed that amino acids preferentially stimulated umami and sweet receptors, with lysine, histidine, glutamine, glutamic acid, and arginine emerging as key co-stimulators. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that the receptors belong to Class C/3 GPCRs, with membrane-bound sweet receptor complexes and strong associations with sensory perception of umami, sweet, and bitter tastes. These findings provide a molecular basis for enhancing palatability in canine diets, offering practical implications for the formulation of dry dog food and the design of oral veterinary medicines. The study highlights the importance of specific amino acids, potentially in combination with salts, in modulating taste responses and improving food acceptance in dogs.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

These tip-grown structures are key to direct rhizobia from root hairs to developing nodules, where they are hosted to fix nitrogen. Rhizobia likely progress inside ITs by combining growth and motility, by modes not yet defined. Here, we tackled this question by combining mathematical modeling, live cell imaging, and bacterial mutant phenotyping in Medicago truncatula. Modeling the motion of fluorescently-labeled Sinorhizobium meliloti inside early root hair IT compartments estimated slow movement (2 to 6 m/h), compatible with passive rather than active motility. Consistent with this model, flagella-less fliF and fliF-fliRdel S. meliloti mutants were impaired in active swimming motility in vitro, yet could colonize host roots and nodules in planta. In contrast, mutation in the rhizobactin 1021 siderophore rhbE biosynthesis gene affected both surface motility in vitro, and host root and nodule colonisation. This mutation also promoted the formation of branched ITs in root hairs, which ultimately resulted in impaired nodule development and infection. Our findings support the model estimation and suggest that S. meliloti prioritises flagella-independent surface translocation, partially by secreting rhizobactin 1021 surfactants to reach developing nodules in M. truncatula.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

A longstanding biological paradox in PTSD is the observation of low basal cortisol levels, despite the expectation of elevated cortisol under chronic stress. This low cortisol paradox challenges traditional hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation models. Individuals with PTSD also exhibit normal or near-normal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels despite reduced cortisol and blunted hormonal responses to acute stress. In this paper, we provide further evidence of reduced cortisol levels using a large medical database from thousands of individuals diagnosed with PTSD. To understand this dysregulation, we apply a systems-level mathematical model of HPA axis regulation that incorporates dynamic changes in gland functional mass, the pituitary corticotrophs and adrenal cortex, over weeks to months. Using this model, we demonstrate that enhanced glucocorticoid receptor (GR) sensitivity, a known risk factor for PTSD, can lead to a steady state with low cortisol and normal ACTH, reconciling key clinical observations. The model also recapitulates the blunted cortisol and ACTH responses to acute stress and the dexamethasone-corticotropin-releasing hormone (DEX-CRH) test, reported in PTSD cohorts. Importantly, despite low cortisol levels, basal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity is higher than normal due to the reduced receptor affinity. Thus, individuals with PTSD effectively experience elevated cortisol signaling relative to their GR sensitivity. These findings provide a unified mechanistic explanation for HPA axis dysregulation in PTSD, grounded in the slow time scale of changes in gland functional mass and supported by literature and clinical data.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

These currents contribute to high frequency firing by preventing depolarization block due to Na+ channel inactivation. Wild-type (WT) channels are localized at the soma, proximal dendrites and axons, forming large aggregates (clusters) via their C-terminal proximal restriction and clustering domain (PRC). This study investigates the biophysical and functional consequences of two C-terminal truncation mutations (Y529* and R579*), identified in patients with epileptic encephalopathy, which disrupt this critical clustering domain. Cluster formation was impaired, though not abolished, in neurons expressing mutated subunits together with endogenous WT subunits. Consistent with this clustering deficit, single-molecule imaging revealed altered channel dynamics, with WT channels remaining largely immobile, while mutated forms exhibited intermittent diffusion punctuated by transient immobilization events. This behavior was reproduced by diffusion-capture simulations considering channels with different number of PRC domains (i.e. with mutant subunits) and labile scaffolding interactions. Patch-clamp recordings revealed no significant difference in excitability between WT and mutant-expressing neurons. However, we observed increased firing in both conditions compared to non-transfected neurons. This suggests that Kv2.1 overexpression (for both WT and mutant channels) counterintuitively enhances neuronal excitability.

In Parkinson's disease (PD), the degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons leads to motor symptoms. Positron emission tomography (PET) using radioligand [18F]fluorodopa detects reduced striatal dopamine synthesis capacity in PD patients. Demographic factors such as sex and BMI are also associated with dopamine synthesis capacity. The combined contribution of demographic and clinical effects however remains elusive. It also remains unresolved how the dopamine synthesis capacity is correlated between striatal subregions and how the dopamine synthesis capacity and dopamine receptor function across striatal regions are associated with each other in PD patients and healthy controls. MATERIAL, AIMS, AND METHODS. For this retrospective register-based study, we used baseline [18F]fluorodopa PET data acquired at the Turku PET Centre between the years 1988-2016 with three different scanners (Ecat 931, GE Advance, HRRT). The data included scans of 350 adult human subjects, including 132 healthy controls (65 males and 67 females), and 218 PD patients (134 males and 84 females). The primary aim was to simultaneously investigate the effects of PD, age, sex and BMI on regional dopamine synthesis capacity (influx rate constant Kiref quantified with Patlak) using Bayesian linear regression. Secondary aims were to assess interregional correlations of dopamine synthesis capacity, and the association between regional presynaptic dopamine synthesis and postsynaptic dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R) availability in subjects who also had a proximal [11C]raclopride PET scan. RESULTS. We found modest support for age-dependent decline in dopamine synthesis capacity, increased capacity for higher BMIs, and for higher capacity in females versus males. These effects were smaller than the effect of PD status. Dopamine synthesis capacity across regions was correlated in both patients and controls. Support for positive correlation between the synthesis capacity and the D2R was observed in caudate nucleus. CONCLUSIONS. PD and demographic effects are independently associated with the striatal dopamine synthesis capacity. The capacity is reduced by PD, decreased through age (particularly after the age of around 50), higher in females versus males, and weakly increased in higher BMIs. Synthesis capacity is correlated between the striatal and thalamic regions in both PD patients and controls. The dopamine synthesis capacity was positively correlated with the D2R availability in caudate. Scanner affects the estimates of dopamine synthesis capacity measured with [18F]fluorodopa PET, and it is preferrable to adjust for such variation in the data.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

To overcome this, we proposed a generative adversarial network (GAN) framework to enrich training features within neural signal datasets. Specifically, we synthesized artificial neural signal waveforms of the primary motor cortex (M1) from functionally related cortical regions, thereby enhancing neural datasets for improved motor kinematics decoding via DNN. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings during goal-directed arm-reaching tasks, our results showed that enhancing individual datasets with GAN-synthesized M1 signals significantly improved decoding performance by about 10% (p < 0.05).

Validation used experimentally derived ground truth data acquired by controlled electrical stimulation, allowing precise spike time-locking. Compared to Spike2 software, our approach achieved higher F1-scores and reduced false positives, indicating improved spike sorting. Although XGBoost achieved the highest median F1-scores, optimal performance was dependent on individual combinations of feature sets and models for each recording. In some recordings with many nerve fibers and a low signal-to-noise ratio, reliable sorting was not feasible.

Three serotonin (5-HT) protocols have been found to induce LTF with distinct effectiveness: the five-pulse regular-spaced Standard protocol; the five-pulse irregular-spaced Enhanced protocol; and the two-pulse protocol with an interval of 45 min. We previously compared long-term dynamics of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform ERK after these protocols. Here we examined the long-term dynamics of additional kinases critical for LTF: p38 MAPK, protein kinase A (PKA), and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK). All four kinases showed complex dynamics of activity during 24 h, with a first wave of increase occurring shortly after 5-HT treatment and ending within 5 h, and a second wave from ~ 5 h to 18 h. After the Standard and two-pulse protocols, all kinase activities returned towards basal at 24 h, but after the Enhanced protocol some remained elevated at 24 h. Interactions and multiple feedback loops among the kinase pathways, and with the growth factors Aplysia neurotrophin (NT) and transforming growth factor-{beta} (TGF-{beta}), contribute to development of molecular clocks underlying these complex dynamics. These results help to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of LTF and provide insights that may help design improved training protocols for induction and maintenance of LTF and long-term memory.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms underlying PRL development remain elusive, and no single hypothesis fully explains its characteristics. Investigations into PRL development are hindered by oculomotor assessments, which often focus on fixation ability while neglecting other eye movement characteristics and potentially conflating different behaviors over time. In previous work, we introduced a series of oculomotor metrics in cases of simulated central vision loss, demonstrating that complex profiles of eye movement behavior can be extracted from a simple visual task. Here we present longitudinal data from 10 patients with MD as evidence of the feasibility of using these metrics to characterize different profiles of eye movements following central vision loss. Consistent with findings in healthy individuals using artificial scotoma, the metrics reveal substantial individual differences in behavior, both at baseline and after visual training. Overall, patients exhibit significantly higher saccadic re-referencing than controls, despite larger inter-individual differences. These metrics provide a detailed evaluation of oculomotor behavior in patients with central vision loss and offer a valuable tool for assessing progress in training protocols.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

To curb ETEC related diarrhoea, several candidate vaccines are in development, with ETVAX(R) being the most advanced. Although immunogenicity studies have primarily focused on measuring antibody titres, assessing antibody avidity offers additional valuable insight into antibody quality and immune maturity. This study assessed anti-CS3 and anti-LTB IgG avidity in Zambian children to better understand vaccine-induced antibody responses in an endemic setting. Methods: Children aged 6-23 months (n=60) received three quarter-doses of ETVAX(R) with dmLT adjuvant on days 0, 14, and 90. Plasma samples collected at baseline (V1), seven days after the second dose (V5), and seven days after the third dose (V7) were analysed by limiting antigen dilution ELISA to calculate avidity indices (AI). Naive classification was performed using titre-based thresholds (20th percentile of baseline titres) and avidity-defined naivety (AI < 0.5). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the discriminatory performance of avidity indices against titre-defined naive status. Results: Baseline avidity was detectable for both CS3 and LTB, consistent with prior natural exposure. Mean CS3 IgG avidity decreased from 0.7 at baseline to 0.6 after the third dose (p<0.001), while LTB IgG avidity showed transient decreases but no net gain. Naive classification at baseline revealed that 9/60 children had titres but low avidity (functional naivety), and 6/60 had waned titres but high avidity. Only one child was naive by both criteria for CS3, and none for LTB. ROC analysis demonstrated moderate discrimination for CS3 (AUC=0.65; optimal cut-off AI=0.36) but poor discrimination for LTB (AUC=0.30). Conclusion: In this endemic population, ETVAX(R) induced strong antibody titres but minimal changes in avidity over time with inter-individual differences, while ROC analysis highlighted the need for context-specific thresholds. These findings show the need for both antibody titre and avidity assessment in vaccine evaluations in endemic settings.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Selective inhibition of PARP1 has emerged as a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic index of PARP inhibitors, a class of anticancer agents that exploit defects in DNA repair pathways. While PARP inhibitors have shown remarkable clinical benefit, particularly in BRCA -mutated tumors, the lack of discrimination between PARP1 and its close homolog PARP2 often leads to hematological toxicity and limits treatment efficacy. Therefore, achieving molecular selectivity for PARP1 remains a central challenge in the rational design of safer and more potent inhibitors. Here, we perform atomistic molecular dynamics simulations using potential of mean force (PMF) calculations, energetic decomposition, and targeted in silico mutagenesis to dissect the molecular determinants underlying PARP1 versus PARP2 selectivity across four representative approved compounds. Our simulations of the catalytic domain were used to quantify residue-ligand contact frequencies, ligand-induced modulation of protein flexibility, and the free-energy landscapes governing binding and unbinding processes. Contact analysis identified key residues mediating ligand recognition, while energetic decomposition characterized the dominant stabilizing forces inducing ligand-protein interactions. Importantly, our PMF profiles revealed distinct energetic and molecular features of association pathways responsible for ligand selectivity. Our results demonstrate that selective inhibitors stabilize unique PARP1 interactions and follow favorable low-barrier association routes, whereas the same ligands encounter higher barriers in PARP2. Together, these findings provide a unified mechanistic framework for selectivity and inform the design of next-generation PARP1 inhibitors with improved efficacy and safety.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

The factors that limit their spread remain unclear. To investigate this paradox, we studied the Segregation Distorter (SD) system, a selfish coadapted gene complex in Drosophila melanogaster. SD biases its transmission by killing sperm carrying a homologous chromosome bearing a target locus, Responder (Rsp), which appear as satellite repeats. Such selfish killing impairs male fertility and imposes selective pressure on the host genome to evolve resistance, either by deleting Rsp copies or acquiring unlinked suppressors. To characterize the spectrum of Rsp alleles and the frequency of segregating suppressors, we surveyed 90 strains from the Drosophila Genome Reference Panel. Rather than loss of Rsp, we found that over half of the strains (52/90) harbor suppressors located on the X chromosome or autosomes, but not the Y chromosome. The widespread presence of strong suppressors limited the resolution of our genome-wide association mapping; however, recombination analysis identified a strong X-linked suppressor to a ~300 kb interval on the chromosome. Together, our findings suggest that pervasive, multilocus suppression constrains the spread of SD in natural populations.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

We present a simple, architecture-agnostic approach to make latent spaces biologically legible: a protein-protein interaction (PPI) prior that softly steers autoencoder units to recruit genes that are proximal on the interactome while discouraging redundant reuse. Applied to large DNA methylation (~155k) and RNAseq (~993k) compendia and to knowledge-driven (STRING), structure-predicted (RoseTTAFold2-PPI), and union interactomes, this objective reorganizes methylation latents into compact, non-overlapping network neighborhoods without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. The resulting units map cleanly onto biological processes such as cell-cycle control, immune signaling, proteostasis, mitochondrial metabolism, and RNA handling, with a limited, hub-enriched overlap that plausibly bridges modules. We then asked whether this structured geometry transfers downstream. Using paired TCGA cohorts spanning 23 cancers, omic translators trained on these embeddings, especially a shared-latent bidirectional model, outperformed full-matrix baselines in biologically concordant directions (methylation to transcription, genomics to methylation and transcription) and, crucially, inherited the mechanistic imprint of the upstream encoder. Analytical sensitivity mapping showed that translators fed PPI-guided embeddings preferentially learned known cancer drivers and enriched hallmark pathways, whereas accuracy-matched models trained on non-constrained embeddings did not. Thus, the prior not only regularizes but passes forward a functional coordinate system that makes subsequent predictors mechanistically aware. By keeping biology in the loss rather than hard-wiring it into the network, our approach scales to very large cohorts, preserves flexibility for understudied genes, and yields latents that are both performant and interpretable. More broadly, it outlines a practical route to mechanism-anchored representation learning that propagates explanatory structure into downstream tasks, advancing explainable AI for multi-omic analysis and clinical decision support.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

K.; Guttman, M.; Nath, A.", "abstract": "Microtubule-associated protein tau forms characteristic fibrillar species in many neurodegenerative diseases. Neurofibrillary tangles, tau deposits observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), contain a mixture of amyloid-type polymorphic fibrils called paired helical filaments (PHFs) and straight filaments. The formation of heterogenous fibril populations is observed in other diseases and when tau aggregation is induced in vitro with polyanionic species. This suggests that tau's structural transition from a conformational ensemble to various amyloid morphologies is a controlled and, therefore, controllable process. Despite many years of work toward describing aggregation intermediates that could address open questions such as whether fibril polymorphism is imprinted at the start of aggregation or arises due to conformational conversions, our understanding of amyloid structure remains predominantly based on observations of mature fibrils. It is unclear whether these processes are mutually exclusive and to what extent we can bias intermediate conformations toward less toxic states. Here to address the challenge of studying aggregation intermediates and tau's structural conversion, we apply pulsed hydrogen-deuterium exchange with mass spectrometry (pulsed HDX-MS), which revealed differences in the subpopulations formed by tau4RD (a truncated tau construct) within seconds of initiating aggregation with polyphosphate and within hours of heparin-induction.

In the process, precursor cells can lose division potential in favour of differentiation, acquiring specific identities and functions. A simple example of this trajectory is in the stomatal lineage, where epidermal cells transit different stages as they differentiate into stomatal guard cells. In Arabidopsis, stomatal development is orchestrated by three closely related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, SPEECHLESS (SPCH), MUTE and FAMA; which act in sequential steps along the differentiation trajectory. SPCH has a key role at the onset of the lineage, where it promotes asymmetric division and early stomatal identity. At the opposite end of the lineage, FAMA enforces guard cell identity and represses additional divisions of already differentiated cells. Recent data, showing that SPCH is present until late in the lineage where it is necessary for cells to commit to stomatal fate, however, challenges this classic view. How SPCH interacts with FAMA, and what SPCHs targets are at this late stage have remained open questions. Here, we examine the role of SPCH during late stomatal development and show that relative levels and activities of SPCH and FAMA tightly control cell division and expansion. Using a cell-type-specific RNA expression approach, we identify factors downstream of SPCH and FAMA in the late lineage and characterize their temporal and spatial localization. Finally, we demonstrate that timely regulation of late transcriptional targets of SPCH and FAMA is necessary for guard cell morphology and function.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

While most existing methods detect these bursts using simple amplitude thresholds, they often ignore variability in burst duration and task context. More advanced techniques exist but are computationally demanding, often opaque, and dependent on large datasets and strong modeling assumptions. Objectives: This study aims to develop an automated, machine learning based approach to classify beta bursts using nonlinear dynamic features, considering both burst duration and task condition. Method: EEG data were collected from 26 healthy, right-handed participants during three motor tasks: (1) a right-hand isometric pinch grip at 10% maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), (2) rhythmic right-hand finger opening closing in response to auditory cues (3 4 seconds), and (3) the same right-hand opening closing task and concurrent with a steady left-hand isometric pinch grip at 10% MVC. Beta bursts were extracted from the left motor cortex, categorized by duration (short, medium, long), and time-locked to task events. From each burst, four nonlinear features, Fractal Dimension (FD), Wavelet Entropy (WE), Sample Entropy (SE), and Nonlinear Energy Operator (NEO) were calculated to train machine learning (ML) models. Results: Statistical tests and feature selection revealed that FD, SE, and WE varied significantly with burst duration and task type, while NEO was more limited in sensitivity. ML models trained on these features achieved up to 91.1% validation and 85.7% test accuracy, especially when distinguishing bursts of different durations within the same task. Conclusions: These findings suggest that beta bursts reflect structured, task-specific neural dynamics rather than random fluctuations. By using nonlinear features and ML, we introduce a scalable, interpretable framework for burst classification that outperforms traditional methods. This approach advances the understanding of transient beta activity and holds promise for real-time neural decoding in neuroscience and neurotechnology.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify transcriptional noise (TN), defined as the stochastic variability in gene expression, as a latent property of paediatric cancer cells that becomes a driver of adaptive regrowth after treatment withdrawal. Using functional assays, lineage tracing, single-cell transcriptomics, and multiscale landscape modelling, we show that therapy enriches mesenchymal-like tolerant states in neuroblastoma without clonal selection, while post-treatment awakening is a stochastic process fuelled by noise-enabled plasticity in cell-identity programmes. The histone demethylase KDM5A relocates to noisy cell-state genes during awakening, promoting H3K4me3 removal and chromatin remodelling at these loci. KDM5 inhibition abrogates this process, and suppresses transcriptional noise, halts DTP exit, and prevents tumour recovery in both neuroblastoma and hepatoblastoma models.

Methods: Epidural electrocorticogram was recorded from the right hemisphere in 8 rats (14 experiments) using chronically implanted 32-channel flexible electrode arrays during desflurane anesthesia at 6%, 4%, 2%, 0% inhaled concentrations, each maintained for 1 hour. Cortical states were identified by principal component analysis of power spectrograms followed by density-based clustering simultaneously across all anesthetic conditions. State-specific spatiotemporal complexity was quantified by the normalized Lempel-Ziv algorithm to capture signal variability beyond spectral effects. Temporal dynamics were assessed by state occurrence, dwell times, and transition probabilities. Results: Seven cortical states were identified. Six states generally tracked anesthetic depth with an increase in delta power and decrease in complexity, but their occurrence was not tied to any anesthetic level (p<0.001). The 7th state was a paradoxical, activated state that mostly occurred during deep anesthesia and was marked by reduced delta (p<0.001) and elevated complexity (p<0.001). Cortical activity was more likely to remain in a given state than to switch (mean dwell time of 136.55 s, persistence likelihood of 99.36%). When transitions occurred, they followed structured, non-random dynamics, primarily within light- or deep-anesthesia states (FDR-corrected p<0.05), with a mild tendency to exit deep states and enter light states (p=0.0039), consistent with anesthetic emergence. Conclusions: Electrocortical activity is not a unitary function of anesthetic concentration but involves spontaneous dynamics and paradoxically activated states with increased global complexity during deep anesthesia. The results suggest ongoing spontaneous reorganization of cortical activity during prolonged anesthetic challenge and provide new insight into anesthesia-induced brain dynamics that may inform future strategies for monitoring and manipulating the state of consciousness and facilitating recovery from general anesthesia.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

U.; Grabbe, S.; Delacher, M.; Marini, F.; Shahneh, F.", "abstract": "Inflammatory monocytes are increasingly recognized as key amplifiers of psoriasis, yet the epigenetic drivers of their pathogenic signature remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the histone demethylase KDM6B is markedly upregulated and catalytically active in classical monocytes during the imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis model. This is associated with reduced levels of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3, an epigenetic modification linked to chromatin compaction and transcriptional silencing, at the Il1b, Tnf, Pgam1, Pgk1, and Aldoa promoters, together with an enhanced inflammatory and glycolytic gene signature. Pharmacological blockade of KDM6B after disease onset using GSK-J4, a cell-permeable prodrug that is intracellularly converted to the active KDM6B inhibitor GSK-J1, restores H3K27me3 at inflammatory and metabolic loci, suppresses Il1b/Tnf transcription, normalizes bioenergetic profiles, and reduces monocyte and neutrophil recruitment to the inflamed skin. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling further reveals that KDM6B inhibition represses cytokine-mediated signaling, glycolysis, and chemotaxis pathways in monocytes, yet enriches antigen presentation modules, consistent with a shift toward a homeostatic, antigen-presenting surveillance program in myeloid cells and a Treg-supportive milieu. Collectively, our data identify KDM6B as an epigenetic-metabolic switch that sustains monocyte-driven inflammation in the IMQ-induced psoriasis model. Importantly, we provide preclinical evidence that targeting KDM6B can reduce maladaptive inflammatory response even in progressed diseases. These findings propose KDM6B inhibitors as a promising adjunct to current biologics for psoriasis and other myeloid-driven autoinflammatory disorders.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Although the epidemiological link between Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria and BL has been established, our understanding of the underlying immunological mechanisms conducive to tumorigenesis is incomplete. To address a noted gap in our knowledge of the immune landscape, we profiled neutrophil subsets from children with different exposure histories to Pf-malaria and children diagnosed with BL from Western Kenya, along with healthy malaria-naive Kenyan adults. Using multiparameter flow cytometry, we characterized neutrophils by expression of CD15, CD16, CD10, CD11b, CD182, CD184, and CD62L and found that malaria-exposed children exhibited increased frequencies of aged neutrophil subsets, accompanied by a reduction in the mature subset frequencies compared to malaria-naive children. Malaria-exposed children also had neutrophil profiles that closely resembled those seen in the adults. Notably, a positive correlation (rs = 0.7; p < 0.0001) was observed in immature neutrophils between malaria-exposed healthy and BL children, indicating a similar expansion pattern of this subset in both groups. This finding suggests a malaria-driven expansion of the immature subset, potentially promoting a permissive environment for BL.

We benchmarked Oxford Nanopores two protocols, PCR-cDNA and direct RNA, using SKMM2 myeloma cells stimulated with interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ERCC synthetic spike-ins. Direct RNA produced longer, higher-quality reads and more high-confidence isoforms, but showed pronounced 5 prime coverage loss. PCR-cDNA yielded shorter fragments with 3 prime underrepresentation, detecting more low-abundance transcripts at reduced confidence. Protocol-specific biases had major consequences: differential expression analysis revealed limited overlap in IL-6 responsive genes, and pathway enrichment was broader in direct RNA. At the isoform level, differential transcript usage was almost entirely protocol-specific, with case studies (e.g. RPL22L1, GRB2, RNF220) illustrating concordance and divergence.

Within the typhoidal group, S. enterica Paratyphi C causes paratyphoid fever in humans. Ancient DNA from this bacterium has previously been recovered from epidemic-associated burials in Eurasia and Mexico, dating back 6,000 to 300 years. Here, we analyzed dental DNA from seven individuals (radiocarbon dated to 1800--1940 CE) buried at the Temple of the Immaculate Conception in Mexico City, Central Mexico, and identified ancient S. enterica Paratyphi C DNA in a young female with Native American ancestry. Using an in-house targeted enrichment strategy and deep shotgun sequencing, we reconstructed a S. enterica Paratyphi C genome (COYC5) with ~11X coverage. Phylogenetic and comparative genomic analyses place COYC5 in close association with previously reported S. enterica Paratyphi C genomes associated with the 1545 cocoliztli epidemic in southern Mexico, as well as with European strains. Divergence estimates indicate that the Mexican and European lineages shared a common ancestor approximately 1,400 years before present (yBP), reflecting an ancient evolutionary split predating European colonization of Mexico. In contrast, the divergence between COYC5 and the southern Mexican genomes occurred around 516 yBP, coinciding with the onset of the colonial period. This pattern supports a European introduction of S. enterica Paratyphi C during colonization, followed by its local diversification within Mexico. Despite this regional differentiation, the conserved presence of key virulence loci--such as SPI-7 and an active shufflon system--across COYC5, southern Mexican, and European genomes underscores the enduring pathogenic potential of S. enterica Paratyphi C. The identification of this bacterium in 19th-century Mexico City provides the first genomic evidence of its persistence in urban contexts beyond major epidemic outbreaks, offering new insights into its evolutionary trajectory in Mexico. These findings raise new questions about how the pathogen spread and persisted across different ecological, social, and epidemiological contexts in ancient Mexico and the Americas.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Background Single-cell RNAseq data can be harnessed to infer cell-type compositions from spatial or bulk transcriptomes, providing greater biological context underlying systemic tissue or organ dynamics. Here, we used a transcriptome-based systems genetics approach to assess biological factors that influence the cellular composition of tissues, including sex, age and genetic variation in two multiparental mouse resource populations derived from the same 8 parental strains. Methods We leveraged publicly available bulk RNAseq data from kidney, heart and bone from 188 Diversity Outbred (DO) mice and male/female pairs from 58 inbred strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC). DO mice were aged 6, 12 or 18 months. We used single-cell RNAseq data from healthy C57BL/6 mice as reference for cell-type decomposition of bulk transcriptomes. We tested for differences in cell type composition based on age and sex. We then performed genetic analysis on the cell-type composition phenotypes, estimating the heritability of cell composition levels, mapping cell composition quantitative trait loci (ccQTL), and assessing candidate gene intermediates of ccQTL based on a genetic mediation approach and support in the literature. Results The heritability of cell-type compositions differed between the inbred CC and outbred DO. Contrasting this, we observed strong and consistent sex differences between the CC and DO. For example, we observed consistency in renal proximal straight tubule (higher in males), T cell abundance in kidney (higher in females), ventricular cardiomyocyte (higher in males) and endocardial cells (higher in females). DO mice exhibited increased levels B and T cells with age, representing an age-related increase in overall renal immune cell content. In heart, DO mice showed decreased ventricular cardiomyocyte composition and increasing endocardial cell content with age. In bone from DO mice, vascular endothelial cells decreased with age and bone marrow stromal cells increased with age. Genome-wide association yielded several cell composition QTLs (ccQTLs) in the three tissues, likely related to known biological phenomena. These include a ccQTL for cardiac fibroblasts in the CC that contains the Frg2 gene family and fibroblast growth factor inhibitor Spry2, and a bone vascular endothelial cell ccQTL in the DO that encompasses 10 genes encoding members of the S100a protein family. In addition, our analysis revealed several ccQTLs for different renal tubular segments, immune cell content, and approximately two thirds of cardiac cell types. Conclusion We establish a role for transcriptome-inferred cellular states or composition for QTL mapping, which adds further utility to existing resources. Furthermore, differences in heritability and QTL between the CC and DO highlight how variation in allele frequencies and inbred vs outbred genetic backgrounds allow for population-specific genetic effects to be discovered. Several of the renal tubular segment and cardiac cell ccQTLs have narrow confidence regions with the potential to harbor novel biological insight. Overall, we propose that our ccQTL mapping approach can be applied systematically across readily available genetic resource transcriptomes to enable new biological discoveries.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

A.; Wystrach, A.", "abstract": "Navigating insects often pause and rotate to sample their surroundings, behaviours termed scanning. These and other active sampling behaviours embody navigational uncertainty, and are key for spatial learning, yet their neural basis remains unclear. Here, we show that scanning can emerge spontaneously from the same conserved neural circuits used for goal-directed navigation, without requiring a specialized scanning module. We built a biologically grounded model combining central complex (CX) steering, lateral accessory lobe (LAL) oscillators, and stochastic inhibition of forward speed. This minimal system produced diverse, realistic scan dynamics: saccades, fixations and reversals, whose features were qualitatively compared to high-speed video recordings of Melophorus bagoti scanning. Detailed analysis of these natural scans confirmed model predictions, including how scan structure depends on oscillator phase, goal-heading deviation, and navigational uncertainty. Furthermore, the model reveals that simple modulation of forward speed unifies a broad range of behaviors across ant species, from dashes to smooth oscillatory trajectories to pirouettes and voltes. Crucially, it establishes a general distributed control principle; where forward speed acts as a single adjustable parameter regulating the balance between goal-driven exploitation and information-seeking exploration, without requiring centralized decision-making processes.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Therefore, CIP2A is very lucrative therapy target in cancer and AD. So far it has been unclear whether the CIP2A protein harbors any druggable pockets amenable to targeting by small molecules. Here we discover a druggable pocket adjacent to the homodimerization domain of CIP2A. Mutagenesis demonstrates that pocket impacts CIP2A homodimerization, PP2A interaction, and full-length CIP2A protein stability in cancer cells. Further, we identify Gambogenic acid (GNA) as a tool compound that directly binds to CIP2A pocket region. GNA and its derivative Gambogic acid dissociate CIP2A homodimer in vitro and cause CIP2A destabilization in cellulo. The pocket contributes to the impact of GNA on homodimerization based on the protein fragment and mutagenesis analysis.

Here, we provide direct structural evidence for the complex of human Citrate Synthase and human mitochondrial Malate Dehydrogenase 2, which is part of the larger proposed citric acid cycle metabolon. Our structural model supports previous crosslinking studies and suggests that hMDH2 can interact with each subunit of the hCS dimer, forming up to a hexameric complex. However, this complex appears transient as titration of hMDH2 into hCS in activity assays does not saturate.

J.; Nattermann, M.; Wenk, S.", "abstract": "The transition towards a sustainable bioeconomy requires the use of alternative feedstocks, with CO2-derived formate emerging as a promising candidate for industrial biotechnology. Despite its beneficial characteristics as a feedstock, microbial assimilation of formate is limited by the inefficiency of naturally evolved formate-fixing pathways. To overcome this limitation, synthetic formate reduction cascades could enable formate assimilation via formaldehyde, a key intermediate of several existing one carbon assimilation pathways. Recently, the formyl phosphate route, combining ATP-dependent activation of formate to formyl phosphate, followed by its reduction to formaldehyde, was developed through enzyme engineering and characterized in vitro. In this work, we successfully established the formyl phosphate route in vivo by developing a selection strategy that couples formate reduction to growth in a threonine/methionine auxotrophic Escherichia coli. Through adaptive laboratory evolution, we achieved formate-dependent growth via this novel pathway. Evolved strains were capable of growing robustly with formate concentrations between 20 mM and 100 mM with glucose in the co-feed. Genomic and proteomic analyses together with activity assays uncovered that formate activation was limiting in vivo. This discovery guided the rational engineering of a strain capable of efficient formate assimilation through the formyl phosphate route. By demonstrating that novel enzyme activities can link formate reduction to cell growth, our study shows how synthetic metabolic routes can be functionally established inside the cell, paving the way for the engineering of more complex synthetic pathways.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Immunotherapy, in particular, has had dismal success rates in the PDAC due to a tumor microenvironment (TME) that contributes to immune exclusion and poor drug delivery. Many cytokines necessary for Natural Killer (NK) and T cell chemotaxis, activation, and cytotoxicity are absent in the PDAC TME. Despite their early success, cytokine therapies have largely failed in the treatment of solid tumors as a result of the lack of efficacy of single cytokine administration and toxicities from systemic delivery. To overcome these limitations, we designed multiplexed mRNA cocktails encoding diverse interleukins, chemokines, and interferons for intratumoral delivery. Administration of a cytokine-encoding mRNA mixture into mice with orthotopically transplanted PDAC tumors achieved robust yet transient cytokine expression locally in the PDAC TME, leading to NK cell and CD8+ T cell immunity and reduced tumor growth and fibrosis in multiple mouse models. Combining cytokine mRNAs with those encoding tumor-associated antigens further activated CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor control and enhanced survival after just a single dose in PDAC-bearing mice. Remarkably, lipid-based nanoparticle (NP) encapsulation of an all-in-one cytokine and antigen mRNA cocktail allowed safe systemic administration and local delivery of these immunogenic signals to autochthonous PDAC tumors in genetically engineered mouse models, culminating in complete tumor responses in 50% of animals.

We hypothesized that high-frequency fMRI signals can capture spontaneous neural activity that index brain states. Using fast fMRI (TR=378ms) and simultaneous EEG in 27 humans drifting between sleep and wakefulness, we found that fMRI spectral power increased during NREM sleep (compared to wakefulness) across several frequency ranges as fast as 1Hz. This fast fMRI power was correlated with canonical arousal-linked EEG rhythms (alpha and delta), with spatiotemporal correlation patterns for each rhythm reflecting a combination of shared arousal dynamics and rhythm-specific neural signatures. Using machine learning, we found that alpha and delta EEG rhythms can be decoded from fast fMRI signals, in subjects held-out from the training set, showing that fMRI as fast as 0.9Hz (alpha) and 0.7Hz (delta) contains reliable neurally-coupled information that generalizes across individuals. Finally, we demonstrate that this fast fMRI acquisition allows for EEG rhythms to be decoded from 3.8s windows of fMRI data. These results reveal that high-frequency fMRI signals are coupled to dynamically varying brain states, and that fast fMRI sampling allows for more temporally precise quantification of spontaneous neural activity than previously thought possible.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1) is a central mediator of the cellular response to hypoxia and may contribute to epileptogenesis by regulating ion channel expression. Here, we identify the T-type calcium channel CaV3.2 (encoded by Cacna1h) as a direct transcriptional target of HIF1 and demonstrate its role in hypoxia-induced network hyperexcitability. Using neuronal cell lines, primary cortical neurons, and organotypic brain slice cultures (OTCs) from mouse and human tissue, we show that HIF1 activation, either through hypoxia or HIF1 overexpression, consistently increases Cacna1h expression. In NS20Y cells, overexpression of a normoxia-stable HIF1 variant increased Cacna1h promoter activity in both fluorescent and dual-luciferase reporter assays. The same effect was observed in primary cortical neurons, where HIF1 overexpression also elevated network activity measured by multielectrode array recordings. In murine and human OTCs, hypoxia led to marked increase of HIF1 and Cacna1h expression at both transcript and protein levels. Furthermore, oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation (OGD/R) induced a persistent increase in neuronal firing rate, which was recapitulated by HIF1 overexpression alone. Together, these results establish HIF1 as a key transcriptional regulator of CaV3.2 in neurons and reveal a conserved hypoxia-HIF1-CaV3.2 pathway that enhances neuronal excitability. This mechanism may underlie hypoxia-induced network hyperactivity and contribute to the pathogenesis of post-ischemic epileptogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

In Drosophila, hemocytes secrete the cytokine-like ligand Unpaired 3 (Upd3, an IL-6 homolog) to activate JAK/STAT signaling in the gut, yet why this axis is essential for survival after injury has remained unclear. Here we show that loss of hemocyte activation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the consequent failure to produce Upd3 leads to adherens junction disruption, intestinal barrier dysfunction, and increased lethality following clean injury. Hemocyte-derived Upd3 drives sustained STAT activation in the gut epithelium, promoting enterocyte turnover and survival after injury. Chronic STAT activity further modulates intestinal stem cell fate and differentiation, indicating that hemocyte-gut signaling shapes long-term epithelial homeostasis. Notably, hemocytes home to the gut after distant wounding, where their localized presence enhances resistance to enteric infection. Taken together, these findings reveal that Drosophila blood cells bridge distant injury and gut homeostasis through Upd3-mediated inter-organ signaling that links wound sensing to epithelial integrity and host survival.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Here, using a T cell specific conditional knockout (cKO) model, we identify the microtubule affinity kinase 2 (MARK2) as a key intracellular checkpoint that limits CD28 mediated costimulation. In vivo, MARK2 deficiency promotes the development of central memory T cells, enhances basal glycolysis activity in naive CD8 T cells, and leads to the development of systemic autoimmunity in aged mice. In MARK2 deficient CD8 T cells, TCR engagement alone drives sustained proliferation, cytokine production, and glycolysis, processes that normally require CD28 costimulation. Single cell transcriptomic analysis reveals that MARK2 regulates the expression of genes involved in CD28 signaling and metabolic switch. We show that MARK2 restrains the PI3K.AKT.mTORC1 pathway by limiting CD28 driven transcriptional and metabolic programs. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that MARK2 phosphorylates CREB regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2) and suppresses CREB mediated transcription and mTOR activation, whereas CD28 engagement lifts this inhibition. Together, our results redefine the role of CD28 that not only amplifies TCR signaling but also relieves a MARK2 dependent inhibitory signal.

Ventricular base irradiation induced a cardiomyopathy phenotype, with pronounced molecular perturbations in metabolism and electrical conduction, while changes related to tissue structure were predominant following apex-directed RT.

Extreme weather events can push organisms beyond their physiological thermal or hydric tolerances and thus limit where they can persist, affecting their geographic distributions. Species might be especially sensitive to extreme weather at the edges of their geographic ranges, where they are often already living near their physiological limits. However, the influence of climatic variability and extreme weather is often ignored in favor of climatic means when estimating distributional and richness patterns. Here we link hundreds of millions of citizen science bird observations from 2004-2024 to high-resolution extreme weather risk maps to explore how climatic variability and extreme weather risk alters summer and winter distributions and biodiversity patterns for 535 North American species. We find that species distribution models accounting for historical extreme weather risk performed better at predicting richness and the presence of individual species across 220 well-surveyed sites. Models incorporating extreme weather predicted narrower geographic distributions than models relying on only climatic means, with species ranges shrinking an average of 6% in summer and 10% in winter and range truncation observed at the range edges. These effects were observed in both seasons but were particularly strong in winter, a time with greater short-term weather variability than summer. Richness estimates were substantially lower when extreme weather was accounted for, especially in the US southwest and central plains (up to 30-40 fewer species), regions highly prone to extreme heat, cold and drought. Our results suggest that more mechanistically informed biodiversity predictions that account for extreme weather are critical for reliably predicting shifting distributional and biodiversity patterns.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Biogels from roots and microbes are known to form persistent surface coatings with soil sorbents, where they host microbial hotspots. Yet research has mainly focused on their interactions with minerals. The interactive effects of biogels and biochar on soil carbon dynamics remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to assess the effects of biogel coatings on fresh and aged biochar, particularly under drought, with a focus on biochar degradation and microbial responses. We conducted a three-factorial soil incubation study to examine the effects of fresh and aged biochar, with or without biogel amendment, under two moisture levels (30% and 70% water holding capacity, WHC). Using 14C labelled biochar, we quantified biochar degradation and biochar-induced priming effects by measuring 14CO2 respiration, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and its 14C incorporation, hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme activities, and changes in biochar surface area. Mucilage strongly enhanced microbial incorporation of biochar-derived C, specifically from aged biochar under drought conditions, while the opposite effect was observed in soils amended with fresh biochar. This demonstrates the greater microbial accessibility of aged biochar surfaces and limited use of fresh biochar due to inaccessibility of the hydrophobic surfaces, and in consequence the preference for more easily accessible C sources. Additionally, mucilage significantly reduced the Michaelis Menten constant (Km) of beta-glucosidase by up to 58% in soils amended with aged biochar under drought. This indicates that under these conditions, the interaction of the aged biochar with the biogel may have created a unique habitat requiring specific enzyme systems with higher affinity. Our findings highlight the role of mucilage in regulating microbial surface access and thus the decomposition of biochar, particularly under moisture-limited conditions. The synergy between aged biochar and biogels provides a promising new perspective to further enhance biochar-based drought mitigation, specifically for managing microbial activity in drought-prone soils.

Despite widespread directional selection on heritable traits, including life-history traits, evolutionary stasis often prevails, with no detectable microevolutionary response. However, evidence of microevolution in some populations raises a key question: do populations under similar ecological conditions and selective pressures exhibit parallel evolution in the same traits? To address this, we examined age at first reproduction (AFR) in three contemporary human populations considered semi independent replicates, sharing a genetic, demographic, and historical background, with pedigree data available for ~7 generations. Across all populations, we found strong directional selection favoring earlier AFR, yet quantitative genetic analyses revealed consistently low heritability (h2 = 0.11). Only in the Charlevoix population did AFR show a negative genetic correlation with relative fitness, where more than 50% of the standardized phenotypic selection gradient was explained by the genetic selection gradient. Using the Breeder's Equation and Robertson's Secondary Theorem of Selection, we predicted an evolutionary response to selection for AFR, which emerged only in Charlevoix. However, neither phenotypic nor breeding values of AFR showed temporal trends, indicating evolutionary stasis. These findings demonstrate that even under consistent directional selection and moderate additive genetic variation, microevolutionary responses may vary across replicate populations. Our results underscore the prevalence of evolutionary stasis, challenging assumptions about the inevitability of microevolution in response to natural selection.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

It has been instrumental in the adaptation of mammalian species to diverse environments, as reflected by its rapid molecular evolution (7,8). However, the origins and evolutionary dynamics of liver cell types and their structural organization remain largely unexplored. Here we report evolutionary analyses of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility data for liver cells from 17 species, spanning all major feeding strategies (herbivory, omnivory, carnivory, insectivory), great apes (including humans), placental clades (Afrotheria, Xenarthra, Laurasiatheria, Euarchontoglires), major mammalian lineages (placentals, marsupials, monotremes), and a bird as outgroup. Integrated with spatial transcriptomics, our data reveal that liver zonation-the compartmentalization of hepatocyte functions along the lobule, the fundamental anatomical and functional unit of the liver-is conserved across mammals but absent in other vertebrates. We find that zonation originated in the mammalian ancestor, driven by the emergence of WNT and R-spondin signaling from central vein endothelial cells, which activate central hepatocyte gene expression via the transcription factor TCF7L2. Despite this conserved architecture and signaling, genes with zonated expression exhibit rapid evolutionary turnover. Consistently, hepatocytes evolve fast, likely due to reduced selective constraints, enabling adaptive changes under positive selection. Alongside immune cells, hepatocytes are therefore key drivers of the rapid evolution and functional innovations of the liver. In great apes, we identify human-specific shifts in zonation and cell-type-specific expression linked to recent cis-regulatory changes, particularly in genes involved in lipid metabolism, likely contributing to human-specific metabolic traits.

Their virtual absence in mammals makes these enzymes attractive targets for antimicrobial drug development and mitochondrial functional restoration.

These models, trained on large datasets of protein sequences, can generate embeddings, high-dimensional numerical representations that encode valuable information about the structure, function, and evolution of proteins. However, conventional usage has largely been based on arbitrarily determined variable sets (embedding modes), including the choice of embedding layer, pooling method, and padding, which can potentially lead to a suboptimal representation with low information content for a given downstream task. The scalability of protein embedding mode extraction is limited by inefficiencies in both space (memory) and time (computation). (i) Accumulating all outputs in memory and writing them to disk in a single operation leads to a memory bottleneck. (ii) Additionally, repeated embedding of the same sequence to extract different embedding modes introduces unnecessary computational overhead and reduces throughput significantly. Results Here, we present PEPE (Parallel Extraction for Protein Embeddings), a command-line tool designed for high-throughput multi-modal protein sequence embedding extraction. We demonstrate that PEPEs parallel process achieves a total run time several orders of magnitude faster than sequential approaches. We also show how, SOTA peak memory usage scales with output size and fails once memory capacity is exceeded, whereas PEPEs peak memory usage remains consistently below the critical limit, allowing the extraction of multimodal embeddings that exceed the amount of available memory.

Force development and ATP utilisation during fixed-end contractions are typically five times slower in slow than fast muscles from the same species.

We therefore used small-angle X-ray diffraction to provide a structural estimate of the fraction of myosins attached to thin filaments in slow muscle. X-ray signals associated with myosin binding to actin indicate that only about 10% of myosin motors are actin-bound during fixed-end tetani of rat soleus slow muscles, compared with about 25% in mouse EDL fast muscle. Moreover, X-ray signals associated with the helical organisation of OFF myosin motors in the thick filaments show that about 70% of myosin motors remain in the OFF conformation during tetanic contraction of slow muscle, compared with only 30% in fast muscle. The much slower force development in soleus muscle also allowed clear separation of early structural changes in thick filaments on activation, some of which are distinct from those reported previously in fast muscles. Moreover, the early structural changes in soleus muscle have about the same amplitude in a twitch and a tetanus, suggesting that they are triggered by thin filament activation rather than thick filament stress, and implying a fast signalling pathway between thin and thick filaments.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Dual-polarity MSI was performed on the same tissue for hepatic metabolites and lipids, and results showed concomitant alteration of liver lipid zonation upon PFOS exposure. With MALDI-TIMS-MSI, our results for the first time demonstrated on-tissue differentiation of PFOS isomers. Multi-modal imaging revealed isomer-specific PFOS distribution and spatial lipidomic changes, both mapped to canonical hepatic zonation markers, to reveal zone-selective PFOS toxicokinetics/toxicodynamics. Together our results demonstrate the critical need for further investigating isomer-specific PFAS toxicity.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Red pandas, endangered mammals inhabiting an elongated montane region in south-central Asia, are up for IUCN Red List reassessment in 2025. One issue determining their status is species taxonomy. A recent mtDNA analysis compiled from several previous studies found they were united as one species, with weak support for a western sublineage and four haplogroups correlated with specific geographic regions. However, the crucial section of their midrange, Bhutan, was absent from that analysis. Now, sequences from red pandas in Bhutan have been added to that dataset and reanalyzed here. Phylogenetic analyses of these data, 91 haplotypes from ~770 samples representing the entire red panda range, indicate again that red pandas are only one species, based on mtDNA. Bhutan hosted three of the previously defined four haplogroups and both putative subspecies (red and pink A. f. fulgens, orange A. f. styani). However, with the addition of the Bhutan missing link, the haplogroups graded even more into one another phylogeographically across their range, effectively displaying a genetic cline. Additionally, no large geographically specific subclade representing a subspecies was significantly supported within the large clade grouping all red pandas as one species. This study further reinforces the conservation priority of encouraging gene flow via protecting prime habitat areas internationally, connected by wildlife corridors and transboundary cooperation, allowing natural evolution for species survival.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

A.; Iwamoto, H.; Tillman, A. N.; Filliben, Z.; Walsh, A. E.; Baganz, N. L.; Robson, M. J.; Zapata, M.; Quan, N.; Blakely, R. D.", "abstract": "Neurobehavioral disorders, ranging from depression to schizophrenia, have been found to display immune system alterations. The high incidence of comorbidity of these disorders, particularly depression, with chronic inflammatory conditions suggests shared mechanisms contributing to the manifestation of these conditions. We have previously shown that peripheral modulation of the innate immune system in mice rapidly triggers enhanced serotonin (5-HT) clearance in vivo associated with increased anxiety- and despair-like behaviors that can be suppressed by serotonergic elimination of p38 MAPK. Forebrain-projecting 5-HT synthesizing neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN5-HT) play a key role in regulating behaviors related to mood and anxiety and whose perturbations are observed in multiple affective disorders. Here we identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms that can translate peripheral innate immune system activation into changes in 5-HT signaling capacity. Using whole cell patch clamp recordings from acute midbrain slices, we demonstrate that the proinflammatory cytokine, IL-1{beta}, acts cell autonomously through its receptor, IL-1R1, via the p38 MAPK signaling pathway to rapidly inhibit firing of DRN5-HT neurons. In the dorsal hippocampus, we found that as with acute, peripheral lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, local injections of IL-1{beta} rapidly enhance 5-HT clearance as assessed by in vivo chronoamperometry. Like IL-1{beta}, TNF also acts via a serotonergic p38 MAPK dependent pathway to reduce excitability of DRN5-HT neurons. Immunocytochemical studies reveal that, IL-1R1, is nonuniformly expressed by DRN5-HT neurons and is required for LPS-induced inhibition of these cells as detected by cFos activation, with sex-dependent patterns evident. Moreover, we detected both DRN5-HT IL-1R1-dependent and -independent LPS-mediated changes in cFos changes in forbrain projection areas. Our findings support a growing appreciation that serotoninergic neurons contribute to changes in CNS physiology and behavior following peripheral immune activation. More specifically, our studies attest to a functional role of serotonergic IL-1R1 in mediating IL-1{beta} following peripheral innate immune activation, effects likely to arise both from changes in diminished 5-HT neuron excitability and elevated 5-HT clearance.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

To test whether this Memory Bias for Error Events is specific to social stimuli, 140 participants completed a Flanker task with trial-unique faces (social) or objects (non-social) as background images, followed by a surprise memory test.

In this context, the identification of metabolic vulnerabilities of IAV replication could help develop complements to existing antiviral strategies. Here, we used nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitors to demonstrate that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is essential for IAV replication and infectious particles production both in vitro and ex vivo. We established an innovant ex vivo model of murine organotypic lung cultures (mOLC) that is pertinent to analyze cell metabolic alterations triggered by IAV infection. Using untargeted metabolomic profiling and spatial transcriptomic analyses, our research revealed that IAV-infection decreased NAD+ levels in mOLCs, while PARPs, a group of NAD+-consuming enzymes, were upregulated. Pharmacological inhibition of the mono-ADP-ribosyl-transferase (mono-ART) activity of PARPs restricted IAV infection ex vivo, suggesting that NAD+ sustains the proviral activity of these enzymes. Overall, our study identifies NAD metabolism as a central regulator of IAV infection, providing redox cofactor to host cell biosynthetic processes and substrate for mono-ART activity.

The best-known example is the Kluyveromyces lactis toxin zymocin, which is encoded by a 9-kb killer plasmid assisted by a 13-kb helper plasmid. These plasmids are distantly related to eukaryotic dsDNA viruses and have been called Virus-Like Elements (VLEs) but they do not produce virus particles. Their evolutionary origin is unclear because VLEs have been found only in budding yeasts (subphylum Saccharomycotina of phylum Ascomycota) and not in any other fungi. Here, we show that similar VLEs are present in two deeply divergent phyla of terrestrial fungi, Zoopagomycota and Mucoromycota. In Zoopagomycota, some isolates of Coemansia harbor more than 20 different linear dsDNA plasmids simultaneously, many of which encode their own DNA polymerases (DNAPs). We did not identify any functional killer toxins encoded by the new VLEs, but phylogenetic analysis of the chitinase genes present on some of them suggests that they are orthologs of the chitinase subunits of killer toxins encoded by Saccharomycotina VLEs. Phylogenetic analysis of DNAPs shows that the diversity of VLEs in Zoopagomycota greatly exceeds that in Saccharomycotina, and that Saccharomycotina killer and helper plasmids are related to two lineages of VLEs present in Zoopagomycota. Our results indicate that VLEs were present in the common ancestor of all terrestrial fungi about 650 Mya, and that they were already subdivided into killer and helper types by this time.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

However, size metrics are limited in their ability to fully characterize neuroanatomical variation, since the brain and its regions can have divergent morphologies across taxa while maintaining the same volume. Here, we employ high-density geometric morphometric (GM) shape data to capture localized anatomical differences in avian brain endocasts and compare how evolutionary patterns differ between shape and size. We find that the majority of shape variation falls along an elongated-globular spectrum, where terrestrial and aquatic birds generally have anteroposteriorly elongated brains while more aerial birds typically have more rounded, globular brains. Optic lobe shape contained the greatest amount of ecological signal, while rates of shape evolution in the cerebrum were the most uniform across the avian phylogeny. A supermajority (>90%) of endocranial shape variation is independent of evolutionary allometry, demonstrating that a geometric morphometric approach characterizes key aspects of brain anatomy that are missing from volumetric data. Broadly, our results suggest that neuroanatomical diversity in birds is not driven by the dominance of any particular factors, but rather through shape divergence in localized brain structures from the global allometric and ecomorphological patterns.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

These discontinuities can result from various interacting mechanisms, though directly linking ecological and historical factors to observed distributions or genetic disjunctions often proves challenging. Intriguingly, substantial research has demonstrated that these spatial and genetic discontinuities frequently occur in species with long-lived planktonic larvae, which possess the capacity for extensive oceanic dispersal. This study investigates the population genetics of one such species, the bat star Patiria miniata. Despite its long-lived planktonic larval stage of six to ten weeks, P. miniata maintains both a range gap and a, geographically separate, strong genetic disjunction throughout its distribution from Alaska to Baja California. Utilizing low-coverage whole-genome sequencing of over 200 individuals collected throughout the P. miniata range between the early 2000s and 2023, we corroborate previous findings of a significant genetic disjunction across Queen Charlotte Sound, north of Vancouver Island. Additionally, we present new evidence of strong divergence at several genomic loci across an extensive range gap in Washington and Oregon, despite subtle genetic population structure at most loci here. Such differences may reflect more recent ecological or oceanographic barriers, rather than historical processes. Our results demonstrate that while marine invertebrate populations may appear panmictic based on genome-wide metrics of population structure alone, strong local selection for specific gene segments may be maintained in some populations. This research contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between dispersal potential and local adaptation in marine ecosystems and highlights the importance of considering both genetic structure and finer-scale adaptation in coastal marine populations.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

However, most studies documenting these patterns, especially in mammals, have been conducted at single time points in adult animals. Thus, the processes by which phylosymbiotic signals emerge during early mammalian life stages are unclear. Here, we compared gut microbial communities from pups of four species of Peromyscus mice (P. californicus, P. leucopus, P. polionotus, and P. maniculatus) bred in captivity, collecting samples from three developmental timepoints (birth, mid-weaning, and weaning). Further, we evaluated host gene expression in large intestine tissue and used a novel application of congruence to compare host gene expression profiles across developmental stages as a means to investigate potential mechanisms by which hosts select their microbiome. We find that Peromyscus pups are not born with phylosymbiotic large intestinal microbial communities, but that these signatures emerge halfway through the weaning period. Strikingly, the host gene expression profiles exhibit different trajectories, such that host transcriptomic profiles closely reflect host phylogeny at birth, but this pattern weakens over development. Finally, Peromyscus spp. exhibit a significant number of differentially expressed genes across all developmental stages, including some clusters of genes implicated in host-microbe interactions. Collectively, these data demonstrate complex community assembly processes in early mammalian development and establish Peromyscus spp. as a powerful model to explore how transcriptomic variation influences host selection and microbiota filtering.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Location: the main area invaded by lantana on the Australian continent, i.e., coastal and subcoastal eastern Australia from northern Queensland to southern New South Wales up to approximately 100 km inland, across 22 degrees latitude. The native range of lantana in the Americas was also represented. Methods: we used DArTseq to generate genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for >600 individuals representing the native and Australian invaded ranges of lantana. We analysed data from >20,000 SNPs to identify distinct genetic clusters, and test the extent to which they corresponded with taxonomic descriptions and morphotype concepts used in lantana biological control. Genome sizes were estimated for a small representative subset of individuals using flow cytometry. We used MaxEnt to estimate habitat suitability for different lantana genetic clusters, and compared these predictions with observed patterns in biological control agent host-specificity. Results: invasive lantana in Australia consisted of several divergent genetic clusters of most likely tetraploid individuals. Gene flow between genetic clusters was limited, consistent with the notion that multiple species introductions and/or hybridisation events were part of the invasion history. Two widespread, homogeneous genetic clusters were found to be dominant in Australia; two other genetic clusters with more limited distributions were identified with potential for future spread. Biological control agent host preferences were consistent with identified genetic clusters. Main conclusions: treating invasive lantana as a single taxon may be counterproductive for effective management. Comprehensive taxonomic revision is needed to enable more precise identification of invasive taxa.

We discovered deterministic heterogeneity at both intra- and inter-alveolar levels, with aerosol distribution forming a characteristic \"mosaic\" pattern in which only specific alveolar clusters received particles. The pattern was consistently formed in vivo during spontaneous breathing and ex vivo using both positive- and negative-pressure ventilation.

Learning BN structure from multiscale biomedical data is a central problem in this context. Computational methods for model reconstruction inherit the limitations of the underlying model selection criteria. As a result, the quantification of model features, structural consistency, and interpretability can suffer, making data-driven BNs context-dependent, unstable, and not directly portable across studies. Some of these concerns have been addressed by the introduction of the Minimum model Uncertainty (MU) principle and the corresponding MU scoring criterion. This work develops and refines the MU criterion, comprehensively assessing its operating characteristics in comparison with conventional scoring criteria to ensure its wide applicability across diverse biomedical research scenarios. Methods: The MU criterion is derived under broad network neighborhood considerations. Quality is assessed using misclassification error estimates. To enable this, we construct a dedicated statistical relationship model. We validate the findings numerically and demonstrate performance gains on real biomedical data.

We present GhostFold, a method for conjuring structure-constrained synthetic MSAs from a single amino acid sequence, bypassing the need for traditional homology searches. Leveraging the ProstT5 protein language model and the 3Di structural alphabet, GhostFold projects a query sequence into a tokenized structural representation and iteratively back-translates to generate an ensemble of diverse, fold-consistent sequences. These synthetic alignments (pseudoMSAs) encode emergent coevolutionary constraints that are sufficient for high-accuracy structure prediction of difficult targets such as orphan proteins and hypervariable antibody loops. GhostFold consistently matches or exceeds the performance of MSA-based and language model-based structure predictors while being computationally lightweight and independent of large sequence databases. Notably, we observe a decoupling of confidence metrics (e.g., pLDDT) from prediction accuracy when using pseudoMSAs, suggesting that AlphaFold2's internal confidence calibration is strongly influenced by the statistical properties of natural sequence alignments. These results establish that structure-guided synthetic MSAs can functionally substitute for evolutionary data, offering a scalable and generalizable solution to one of the central limitations in computational structural biology.

However, off-target effects in the radiation field vicinity may induce toxicities that exacerbate patient symptoms, leading to diminished quality of life. In patients receiving radiotherapy (RT)--the standard of care for head and neck cancer (HNC) -- a major toxicity of particular concern in feeding tube dependence. This is often due to the proximity of the tumor to vital organs such as the esophagus and larynx. Treatment in these areas can cause adverse events, such as difficulty swallowing and dry mouth, increasing the need for a feeding tube. Such symptoms can be measured using patient-reported outcomes (PROs), which provide a measure of a patient's health, symptoms, and overall wellbeing, as perceived and reported by the patients themselves. To capture both on-target tumor response and off-target toxicities of RT in HNC, we developed a mathematical model to inform acceptable radiation doses that maximize tumor response while minimizing off-target toxicities. The classical linear-quadratic dose-response model was employed to describe tumor response to RT with exponential growth. To model off-target toxicities, we introduce a novel concept of radiation exposure analogous to drug exposure. We then employed an inhomogeneous continuous-time Markov chain model with radiation exposure as a time-varying covariate to describe time-to-feeding tube dependence. We then define two thresholds to be selected by the clinician in consultation with the patient to derive minimum efficacious dose (MED) and maximum tolerable dose (MTD). We observe that RT is either viable (MED<=MTD) or unviable (MED>MTD). To enhance the model's applicability, we simulated administration of radiosensitizing agents and provision of symptom management therapy by altering model parameters. Overall, this model offers adaptable, data-informed treatment decisions by integrating both tumor control and quality of life considerations into a singular model.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

By focusing on the finite-time risk of extinction, our approach reveals that shorter generation times can lead to a temporary increase in the risk of population or epidemic die-out. We support our findings with precise fixed- point analyses and numerical integration techniques based on real data from various infectious diseases. Although the long-term probability of extinction does not change, the transient dynamics show that a faster-paced transmission process may elevate early extinction risk.

However, its current hierarchical domain structure remains largely unvalidated against individual-level brain imaging data. Building on our prior group-level work showing that data-driven bifactor models outperform RDoC-based models, we applied a multi-stage validation framework to Human Connectome Project (HCP) task fMRI data to test whether individual-level, empirically derived models more accurately reflect the intrinsic organization and behavioral relevance of brain activity. Using confirmatory factor analysis in two independent cohorts, we found that individual-level, data-driven bifactor models consistently outperformed RDoC-based models across multiple fit indices in both training and validation sets. The general factor derived from these models revealed a reproducible macroscale gradient spanning visual-attentional to auditory-default mode networks, aligning with canonical resting-state gradients and supporting its interpretation as a domain-general axis of large-scale brain organization. Applying community detection to subject-specific factor representations revealed four spatial motifs whose centroids corresponded to interpretable brain systems and were robustly reproduced across cohorts. Similarity to these centroids predicted individual task performance in working memory and relational reasoning, as measured by both raw accuracy and latent performance factors. To further assess organizational validity, we applied Mapper-a topological data analysis method-to contrast maps, generating unsupervised graph representations of task-evoked brain activity. Mapper graphs annotated with data-driven centroids showed greater modularity than those annotated with RDoC domains, suggesting that the data-driven framework better captures the topological structure of individual functional brain states. Together, these findings demonstrate that individual-level, data-driven factor models provide a more accurate, interpretable, and behaviorally relevant account of brain organization than the current RDoC framework. By modeling inter-individual variability directly from neuroimaging data, this approach advances precision neuroscience and supports the empirical refinement of dimensional psychiatric frameworks such as RDoC.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

In controls, the cortical territory occupied by disparity-selective columns exhibited a competitive relationship with that of motion- and color-selective columns. Consistent with this pattern, PwA showed a reduction in disparity-selective responses accompanied by enhanced motion- and color-selective activity, as well as expansion of the cortical territory allocated to them.

P.", "abstract": "Walking on uneven terrain becomes more difficult as we age, and gait becomes less automatic. Using mobile brain imaging via high-density electroencephalography (EEG) can provide insight into the neural mechanisms contributing to reduced mobility capability with aging. The objective of this study was to quantify age differences in electrocortical dynamics during uneven terrain walking, both averaged across many strides and variations within a stride. We included 31 young adults and 71 older adults for analysis. All participants walked on an uneven terrain treadmill with four levels of terrain difficulty at their self-selected speed. Compared to younger adults, older adults exhibited a greater increase in step duration variability and mediolateral sacral excursion variability as the terrain became more uneven. We identified multiple brain regions involved during walking on uneven terrain. Regardless of age group, walking on uneven terrain compared to flat terrain led to a widespread change of electrocortical dynamics in the brain, especially in the alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (13-30Hz) band power. In the parieto-occipital region, younger adults experienced a greater reduction in alpha and beta power with increasing terrain unevenness compared to older adults. We also assessed how intra-stride power fluctuations changed with terrain unevenness and age group. Greater intra-stride power spectral fluctuations in the occipital area were associated with greater terrain unevenness for younger adults, but not for older adults. In summary, older adults showed a greater increase in gait variability than younger adults as the terrain became more uneven, but exhibited a lack of modulation of parieto-occipital activity in response to terrain unevenness. The lack of task-related power modulation may suggest reduced cortical network flexibility in older adults. The absence of increased parieto-occipital activity when walking on uneven versus flat surfaces in older adults may also indicate that, unlike younger adults, older adults already heavily rely on visual processes during flat surface walking and may therefore have reduced occipital modulation range remaining to cope with the visuomotor processing demands of walking on uneven surfaces.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

To test whether local antigen delivery is critical for establishing broad immunity, we directly compared respiratory tract and systemic delivery of influenza antigens to mice and hamsters using a replication-deficient adenovirus serotype 5 vector (Ad5 [E1-,E2b-,E3-]). Both immunization routes elicited antibody responses in the lower respiratory tract and antigen-specific B and T cells in the draining lymph node. However, only intranasal immunization established lung-resident memory B and T cells, induced IgA responses in the upper respiratory tract directly at the site of viral entry and supported generation of IgA and IgG antibodies that bound antigenically drifted and distantly related influenza strains, including those of avian origin. Intranasal immunization accelerated viral clearance following heterologous virus challenge and was associated with limited pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, intranasal immunization with the immunologically stealthy Ad5 [E1-,E2b-,E3-] platform supports respiratory and systemic immunity to divergent influenza strains in the absence of overt lung immunopathology, suggesting that local antigen delivery may be key to development of more broadly protective universal flu vaccines.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

The relationship between the extracellular matrix and the host immune response to infection is severely understudied. Deposition of the polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) into the lungs is associated with more severe COVID-19 disease outcomes. HA is a major component of the extracellular matrix in connective tissues and is abundant in many parts of the body, including cartilage, skin, brain, and vitreous body. CD44 is the primary receptor for HA and is found on almost all immune cells in the lung. Known functions of CD44 include mediation of immune cell migration, activation, and differentiation. We hypothesized that increased HA deposition during COVID-19 increases CD44-mediated immune cell infiltration into lungs and results in more severe pathology. Here, we report that in mice infected with a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV-2, treatment with a combination of two anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies confers a significant survival benefit and reduces weight loss and clinical score of the mice on Day 4 post infection. We show that anti-CD44 treatment decreases many key cytokines and chemokines in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid on Day 4. With flow cytometry, we show that anti-CD44 reduces the numbers of neutrophils in infected lungs. We also show through immunofluorescence that treatment with anti-CD44 antibodies reduces colocalization of HA and CD45 in lung sections, indicating that HAs interaction with immune cells contributes to pathology. Our findings demonstrate that disruption of HA-receptor interactions is a way to prevent inflammatory pathology in pulmonary infection.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Some clinical and epidemiological studies associated the usage of zinc supplements with the occurrence of COVID-19 associated mucormycosis, but experimental evidence remains limited. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of zinc enrichment on Rhizopus arrhizus, the predominant causative agent of mucormycosis. The effect of zinc supplementation (5 to 150 {micro}M) on fungal growth, metabolic activity, antifungal susceptibility and biofilm formation, along with cell-wall (Congo red), oxidative (hydrogen peroxide) and osmotic (sodium chloride) stress was evaluated in RPMI-1640. Morphological changes were visualized by scanning electron microscopy. Gene expression was monitored by RNA sequencing. Zinc supplementation promoted R. arrhizus growth in a concentration-dependent manner, with the effect being particularly pronounced under less-favorable conditions, such as alkaline conditions resembling the nasal pH of diabetics. Exposure to zinc enhanced the metabolic activity, and partly alleviated the cell-wall and oxidative stress. Susceptibility to amphotericin B and posaconazole was unchanged. Zinc-supplemented cultures over-expressed multiple genes, notably those associated with respiratory electron transport chain, ergosterol biosynthesis, chitosan production, oxidative stress response, mucoricin, high-affinity iron permease, iron transport multi-copper oxidase and ferric-reductase-like protein. Zinc also augmented the growth/metabolism of several other Mucorales but not Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans. The findings suggest that zinc supplementation supports mucoralean growth and enhances the expression of key virulence factors, implying that excessive intake of zinc supplements during COVID-19 pandemic likely contributed to the emergence of mucormycosis.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Their profile in abnormal lung development in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is unknown. Objective To evaluate circRNA expression profile in CDH-associated abnormal lung development. Methods We profiled circRNAs in rat CDH and control lungs at embryonic day (E)15 and E21 by microarray. We validated identified circRNAs using back-splice junction amplicon sequencing, RT-qPCR, and in situ hybridization. We modified a CircRNA Function prediction Tool to predict CircRNA::micro(mi)RNA::messenger(m)RNA interactions and compared these with Oxford Nanopore RNA sequencing and existing human CDH datasets. Measurements and Main Results Microarrays revealed a unique circRNA biosignature during CDH lung development. CircAnp32e was expressed in a sex-specific and spatiotemporal expression pattern in the epithelium at E15. The predicted mature sequence of circAnp32e overlapped >90% with its human orthologue. CircRNA::miRNA::mRNA interaction networks in E15 and E21 revealed enrichment in inflammation/infection, smooth muscle cell function, cell proliferation/cell cycle regulation, and response to hypoxia pathways. Parental genes of differential expressed circRNAs at E15 enriched pathways linked to cell proliferation/cell cycle/cancer, while at end-gestation, inflammation and cardiovascular processes were also overrepresented. Rat and human CDH lungs showed overlapping pathways with additional enrichment for RNA processing and protein binding/modification in humans. Conclusion A unique circRNA signature during abnormal lung development in CDH may mediate inflammatory responses, smooth-muscle-cell function, and cell proliferation regulation via miRNA sponging. Overlap of downstream pathways in rat and human CDH suggest conserved functions across species. CircRNAs may serve as biomarkers to guide prenatal management and mitigate aberrant lung development in CDH.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

However, the influence of genome doubling on embryonic robustness to environmental stress remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated developmental traits and osmotic responses in tetraploid Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. Tetraploid animals exhibited enlarged body and tissue sizes and produced embryos with approximately 1.6-fold greater volume than diploids, accompanied by moderately delayed development and partial embryonic arrest. When exposed to a range of osmotic environments, both diploid and tetraploid embryos swelled or shrank in response to external osmolarity. Strikingly, tetraploid embryos at the early stage maintained normal cell division across a broader range of osmotic conditions than diploids. Quantitative analyses further revealed that tetraploid embryos exhibit reduced cytoplasmic mass density, largely reflecting lower protein concentration, while lipid and RNA levels remain unaffected. These compositional differences likely buffer volume fluctuations and underlie the enhanced osmotic tolerance of tetraploid embryos. Our findings demonstrate that genome doubling reshapes embryonic cellular physiology in a non-proportional manner to ploidy, thereby enhancing robustness during early development.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Studying the effect of arid conditions on biodiversity patterns and ecological dynamics is therefore critical to understand the evolutionary fate of desert-adapted faunas. Here we provide a global assessment of how aridity influences climatic niche breadth and phylogenetic structure across terrestrial vertebrates. Using distributional data for over 34,000 species of amphibians, squamates, birds, and mammals, combined with environmental data and nearly complete phylogenies of these clades, we quantified species' positions along aridity gradients and their climatic niche breadth, and evaluated phylogenetic clustering at multiple spatial scales. Across all groups, species occupying more arid environments exhibited significantly narrower climatic niches than those from non-arid habitats, supporting the hypothesis that ecological filtering in deserts promotes climatic specialization. Further, analyses of system-wide community phylogenetic structure revealed significant phylogenetic clustering in most arid systems for all clades except birds, underscoring that deserts broadly act as ecological filters at large scale, but this effect is subjected to clade-specific traits. However, finer-scale analyses showed significant phylogenetic overdispersion in several cases, suggesting that competition and micro-niche dynamics might be stronger determinants of phylogenetic structure at the local-to-regional level.

J.", "abstract": "Mitochondrial biogenesis requires the import of ~1,000-1,500 nuclear-encoded proteins across the Translocase of Outer Membrane (TOM) and the Translocase of Inner Membrane (TIM) 22 or 23 complexes. Protein import defects cannot only impair mitochondrial respiration but also cause mitochondrial Precursor Overaccumulation Stress (mPOS) in the cytosol. Recent studies showed that specific mutations in the nuclear-encoded Adenine Nucleotide Translocase 1 (ANT1) cause musculoskeletal and neurological diseases by clogging TOM and TIM22 and inducing mPOS. Here, we found that overexpression of MFB1, encoding the mitochondrial F-box protein 1, suppresses cell growth defect caused by a clogger allele of AAC2, the yeast homolog of Ant1. Disruption of MFB1 synergizes with a clogger allele of aac2 to inhibit cell growth. This is accompanied by increased retention of mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol, suggesting exacerbated defect in mitochondrial protein import. Proximity-dependent biotin identification (BioID) suggested that Mfb1 interacts with several mitochondrial surface proteins including Tom22, a component of the TOM complex. Loss of MFB1 under clogging conditions activates genes encoding cytosolic chaperones including HSP31. Interestingly, disruption of HSP31 creates a synthetic lethality with protein import clogging under respiring conditions. We propose that Mfb1 functions to maintain mitochondrial protein import competency under clogging conditions, whereas Hsp31 plays an important role in protecting the cytosol against mPOS. Mutations in DJ-1, the human homolog of Hsp31, and mitochondria-associated F-box proteins (eg., Fbxo7) are known to cause early-onset Parkinson disease.

Average nucleotide identity analysis and traditional pangenome generation tools struggle to capture the cyanobacterial core genome, but despite its scant conservation, we clearly observe a sharp separation of the taxon by its light utilization preferences -- that is, its light ecotypes. A range of classical ML models trained to predict ecotype achieve exceptional binary classification accuracy even when predicting on partial genomes (Matthews Correlation Coefficient = 0.81 - 0.98), while regression models trained to predict the depth of isolation performed poorly, with relatively high root mean square error values (40.8 - 45.3m).

Here, we describe a variation of this pathway in Orychophragmus limprichtianus, whose seed oil was found to contains previously unknown C24-C28 keto-hydroxy fatty acids that account for ~25% of total fatty acids. Our studies revealed that these compounds are produced through an endoplasmic reticulum-localized discontinuous elongation process in which a 3-keto hydroxy intermediate bypasses full reduction and is extended through a polyketide synthase-like mechanism. Transcriptomic and functional assays identified two divergent enzymes, OlFAE1-2 and the low-activity ketoreductase OlKCR1-1, as central to this process. Protein modeling and mutant analysis suggest that specific amino acid substitutions underlie the altered activity of OlKCR1-1, enabling accumulation of keto intermediates.

To elucidate the mechanism of ROS perception by AHK5 and signaling through posttranslational modifications, a comparative phosphoproteomics analysis was conducted using ahk5 loss-of-function and wild type seedlings in response to exogenously applied H2O2. Under control and H2O2 related conditions, a rapid signaling transition from the MSP to Ser/Thr phosphorylation was observed. AHK5 appears to regulate ROS responsive phosphorylation at the plasma membrane by the modification of nanodomain components such as remorins, aquaporins, IQDs, and patellins, positioning it as a central integrator of redox signaling during adaptation to diverse stresses. AHK5 drives a distinct, ABA independent signaling pathway for H2O2 induced stomatal closure, likely by regulating phosphorylation of key components such as RBOHD, CAS, and HPCA1. Moreover, AHK5-fine-tuned root development involves ABA dependent signaling and appears to act through modulation of auxin transport via phosphorylation of auxin carrier, highlighting a mechanistic divergence between ROS responses in the shoot and root. Our data further suggest that AHK5 orchestrates stress responsive nanodomain associated signaling hubs through regulation of membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal dynamics, and endocytosis to mediate stress responses.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Applying it to 24,945 whole-slide images from 40 human tissues of 983 individuals aged 20 to 70 years old, we identified 218 recurrent microanatomical domains categorized into 74 types across tissues. Domain types varied widely in tissue specificity, with 16% shared across 3 or more tissues and 69% restricted to a specific tissue. Age emerged as the dominant factor in influencing domain abundance, with 28% of domains changing significantly over the adult lifespan. By integrating tissue-level pathology annotations, we distinguished structural changes associated with healthy aging from those linked to subclinical disease, revealing that these processes often remodel distinct tissue compartments. Finally, mapping higher-order networks of domain-domain interactions uncovered age-associated reorganization of organ architecture, while a core framework of interactions remained resilient with age.

Wolfram-like syndrome is primarily caused by variants in the WFS1 gene, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum resident transmembrane protein, Wolframin. To date, the disease mechanism remains unclear, and no therapies are available. Here, we generated a mouse model carrying the pathogenic WFS1E864K allele that recapitulated key features of human Wolfram-like syndrome, including bilateral optic atrophy, retinal nerve fiber thinning and lamination of the outer plexiform layer. We demonstrated, using the Wfs1E864K mouse model, that alteration of the protein leads to impairments of retinal ganglion cell function, associated with a thinning of the inner retina layer and nerve fibers. These alterations are associated with myelin disorganization, axonal death, mitochondrial alterations in the axons, and impairment of endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria communication in the soma. Our data showed that primary deficits are localized in the optic nerve before progressing towards the retinal ganglion cell soma. RNAseq analysis identified several altered signaling pathways such as in lipid metabolism, glia activation response, metabolic stress, organelle transport and quality control. These findings highlighted the critical role of Wolframin in optic nerve mitochondrial physiology, providing us with a pertinent model to develop novel innovative therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Dysregulated expression of its encoding gene, SNCA, has been identified in association with both PD and DLB in short-read sequencing studies. However, such studies do not capture variation in transcript isoforms expressed. Here we combine for the first time SNCA-targeted long-read multiplexed arrays isoform sequencing (MAS-Iso-seq) with unbiased short-read single nucleus (sn) RNA-seq for simultaneous characterization of the SNCA transcript isoform landscape and mapping of isoform expression to specific cell types and subtypes in PD, DLB, and control sample cortical tissues. This approach enabled discovery of numerous SNCA transcript isoforms displaying novel splicing patterns and incorporating novel exons. We further identified an abundant class of transcript isoforms encoding a previously unreported a-Syn protein variant (a-Syn-115) and displaying increased proportional detection in excitatory neurons of PD and DLB tissues in comparison to controls. The proportion of these isoforms was found to be especially high within several specific glutamatergic neuron subtypes. In-depth characterization of the predicted structural and biochemical properties of a-Syn-115 using an in silico modeling approach revealed a greater aggregative affinity compared with canonical a-Syn-140, suggesting the potential for increased cytosolic a-Syn-115 abundance to induce aggregation between heterogeneous a-Syn isoforms, potentially driving fibril formation and disease progression. Together, our findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying a-Syn involvement in multiple synucleinopathies and have translational implications for the development of new precision medicine strategies to combat these diseases, indicating the potential for treatments targeting both specific transcript and protein isoforms, as well as disease-driving cell subtypes.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have found a spatio-temporal hierarchy in the event structure during movie watching and story listening. How the human brain segments stories while reading remains unclear. We examined event segmentation while reading Harry Potter using publicly available 3T fMRI data. To identify neural events, we employed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) within six regions of interest (ROI) in the reading network. The ROIs included the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), middle frontal gyrus (MFG), angular gyrus (AG), inferior frontal gyrus orbital (IFGorb), anterior temporal lobe (ATL), and posterior temporal lobe (PTL). These regions are also associated with DMN. The results revealed multiple timescales of events, with the IFG and AG representing shorter events, while the IFGorb, ATL, PTL and MFG represent relatively longer events. Boundaries of longer events were partially aligned within short events, suggesting a nested hierarchical event structure. Further comparisons identified associations between neural events and annotations from humans and ChatGPT (automated and less subjective segmentation) in the inferior frontal, temporal and parietal areas. Notably, the AG (a core region of the DMN and memory processing) and the IFG (relevant for language processing) exhibited stronger alignment with both sets of annotations. The findings suggest an important role of AG and IFG in event segmentation in reading. They also confirm the connection between the reading network and the DMN in event segmentation. This connection seems to be linked to the hierarchical processing of context-dependent semantic information during reading.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

We discovered significant lineage-specific remodelling of chromatin accessibility predominantly in newly formed pyramidal neurons, highlighting a robust EPO-driven neurogenic response. Notably, transposable elements (TEs), particularly ancient LINEs and SINEs, emerged as critical cis-regulatory elements extensively bound by key neurogenic transcription factors such as NEUROD1/2, FOXG1, and ASCL1. Integrative analyses revealed that these TE-derived regulatory elements orchestrate gene networks involved in neuronal differentiation, synaptogenesis, and synaptic plasticity.

P.", "abstract": "Despite the prevalence of inner speech in everyday life, research on this has been limited, particularly when it comes to non-invasive methods. This preprint aims to fill this gap by using EEG and MEG to collect data from three different inner speech paradigms, and by conducting an initial decoding analysis. Specifically, we tested silent reading, repetitive inner speech, and generative inner speech tasks. We collect a high number of inner speech trials from a few participants. Besides comparing across recording modalities we also compare across inner speech types. Our aim is to analyse the decodability of inner speech within each task and between tasks by the use of transfer learning. We find that in both EEG and MEG, silent reading can be decoded relatively well with 30-40\\% accuracy across 5 words. However, the decoding performance of both types of inner speech is mostly at chance level. This prohibited further transfer learning investigations between tasks. While the inner speech results are primarily negative, we believe our exploration of data size and various decoding methods is valuable. The dataset itself is useful for the research community as it contains a much larger number of trials within one participant than any other inner speech dataset. Having multiple sessions also allows for testing across-session performance. Finally, we systematically compare silent reading decoding performance within 3 participants across four non-invasive modalities. These are EEG, 2 types of MEG machines, Elekta and CTF, and optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs). We also compare the spatiotemporal dynamics of silent reading between these modalities. This is especially aimed at validating OPMs as a new kind of non-invasive brain recording technology. We find comparable performance to EEG, but OPM performance did not reach traditional MEG.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Despite increasing evidence that OPFRs impact neurodevelopment, their effects on the neuroendocrine stress response remain poorly understood. To examine their long-term impact on stress regulation, we treated pregnant C57Bl/6J dams to a mixture of tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (TDCPP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP), and tricresyl phosphate (TCP; 1 mg/kg each) from gestational day (GD) 7 through postnatal day (PND) 14. Adult offspring (8-9 weeks of age) were then challenged with acute stressors, including 1 h restraint or a 6-day acute variable stress (AVS) paradigm. Perinatal OPFR exposure produced persistent, sex-specific alterations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and stress-related neurocircuitry. Following 1 h restraint, OPFR-treated females showed heightened serum corticosterone. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed sex-dependent disruptions in key stress-regulatory pathways after OPFR treatment and 1 h restraint in the hypothalamus (Crhr1, Crhr2, Ptpn5) and pituitary (Crhr1, Pomc, Nr3c1). Females demonstrated more differences in adrenal gene expression related to steroidogenesis (Mc2r, Cyp11b2) and catecholamine biosynthesis (Dbh, Pnmt), with OPFR-treated groups having blunted responses. OPFR AVS females displayed reduced corticosterone and downregulated Pacap/Pac1r expression in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), accompanied by increased behavioral avoidance and immobility. In males, OPFR exposure led to increased BNST Pacap and Pac1r, expression, along with hyperactivity and avoidance behaviors.

Therapeutic strategies aimed towards dopamine restoration, asyn removal and iron chelation have provided symptomatic relief but failed to prevent or slow disease progression. This is in part due to the lack of understanding of the exact pathways leading to neuronal death in PD. In this study, we investigate ferroptosis, a unique cell death mechanism sharing multiple features with PD pathology, as a relevant pathway with implications in disease pathogenesis. We identified an enrichment of ferroptosis genes dysregulated throughout PD postmortem brain samples and several neuronal and glial PD models. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we generated a rapid iPSC-derived synucleinopathy neuronal model harbouring the SNCA A53T mutation and report increased ROS generation, reduced levels of antioxidant glutathione (GSH), impaired mitophagy and a heightened vulnerability to ferroptosis-induced lipid peroxidation and cell death. Critically, inhibition of the key lipid peroxidation enzyme and driver of ferroptosis, 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), rescued synucleinopathy associated pathologies and prevented pathological asyn oligomerisation in SNCA A53T neurons. Furthermore, we report enhanced microglial ferroptosis susceptibility in models of synucleinopathy. In summary, we highlight a new mechanism by which the familial PD-associated SNCA A53T mutation causes cell death and propose 15-LO inhibition as a tractable therapeutic opportunity in PD.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Analysis of peripheral blood-derived neutrophils from infants with RSV admitted to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) highlighted myeloperoxidase (MPO), a hallmark of neutrophil degranulation, as a key indicator of disease severity when compared to control infants. The aim of this study is to investigate MPO as a functional readout of therapeutic efficacy. To mechanistically investigate these clinical observations, we developed a physiologically relevant in vitro model of the paediatric airway. Differentiated paediatric airway epithelial cells (AECs) were cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI), with or without an underlying layer of vascular endothelial cells. Following RSV infection, neutrophil migration and activation were assessed using flow cytometry. The inclusion of an endothelial layer enhanced physiological relevance and more accurately replicated in vivo MPO responses. To evaluate the therapeutic modulation of neutrophil activation, two antiviral compounds-remdesivir (RDV) and RSV604 were evaluated. While both compounds significantly reduced RSV viral load at 24 hours post-infection, only RSV604 attenuated MPO expression. RDV had no measurable effect on MPO levels, suggesting limited efficacy in mitigating neutrophil-driven inflammation. These findings highlight MPO as a biomarker of RSV severity and a functional readout of therapeutic impact. Targeting MPO-driven neutrophil activation may be key to reducing both viral load and inflammation.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

The CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (plerixafor) is routinely combined with G-CSF for non-SCD settings but is ineffective as a single agent in SCD, underscoring the urgent need for alternative strategies. We previously identified 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC) as a physiological inducer of HSPC mobilization during pregnancy. Here, we show that exogenous 27HC enhances AMD3100-induced HSPC mobilization in mice, either alone or with G-CSF. Because 27HC is metabolized by the enzyme Cyp7b1, we tested whether pharmacological Cyp7b1 inhibition could mimic this effect. Treatment with clotrimazole, an antifungal and Cyp7b1 inhibitor, significantly enhanced AMD3100-induced HSPC mobilization in wild-type, SCD, and humanized mice. Importantly, intravenous administration of voriconazole, a clinically approved systemic antifungal with Cyp7b1-binding activity, similarly augmented AMD3100-induced HSPC mobilization in wild-type and SCD mice without altering steady-state hematopoiesis.

Disentangling these forces has been a major challenge, particularly in ectotherms. Testing the competing predictions of the classic time-dependent Generation Length Hypothesis and the replication-dependent speed-fidelity trade-off model, we experimentally assessed individuals with short (mean 15 days) and long (mean 37.7 days) generation time (GT) in the midge Chironomus riparius under constant temperature and estimated the de novo mutation rates by whole genome sequencing. We found that long-GT lines accumulated 1.3-fold more mutations per generation (/gen), consistent with time-dependent mutagenic processes. Conversely, short-GT lines exhibited a nearly two-fold higher mutation rate per day (/day) and a trend towards a transition-biased mutational spectrum (Ts/Tv ratio = 1.28 vs. 0.95), a pattern consistent with a speed-fidelity trade-off in DNA replication. These results suggest that two distinct processes shaped the overall mutation rate. Integrating our data with previous studies and life-history data, we show that the daily mutation rate followed a non-linear relationship with respect to generation time, and that the species' generation time mode coincides with its minimum. This suggests that the generation time is, amongst other factors, selected to optimise the mutational load by balancing between replication accuracy and developmental speed.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

H-NS forms dynamic condensates, while StpA assembles into stable insoluble fibrils. Yet together, the two proteins form heterotypic condensates, whose fluidity and stability are tunable by their relative stoichiometry. By increasing the levels of StpA over H-NS, bacteria increase heterochromatin-associated condensate stability, thus preserving gene repression and optimizing bacterial growth under stress conditions. Structural differences at these protein's dimerization sites help explain their distinct phase behaviors.

A central node in the sphingolipid metabolism network is ceramide, which is converted into numerous derivatives, including sphingomyelin (SM). Through interactions with cholesterol, SM forms liquid-ordered microdomains that influence membrane organization and signaling. Previously, we reported that the Saposin-like (SAPLIP) protein Canopy4 (CNPY4) negatively regulates the levels of free cholesterol in the plasma membrane. Although SAPLIPs commonly regulate lipid metabolism through direct lipid interactions, CNPY4 does not bind cholesterol directly. Here, we show that CNPY4 interacts with multiple sphingolipids in vitro, including ceramide and SM, and with ceramide in cells. We also demonstrate that CNPY4 knockdown elevates SM levels at the plasma membrane and disrupts cellular localization and abundance of ceramide, suggesting that the levels and consequently the homeostatic distribution of these sphingolipids is under control of CNPY4. Although the most pronounced effect of CNPY4 loss is on the ceramide/SM conversion pathway, it additionally impacts the levels of over 150 cellular lipids and modulates neutral sphingomyelinase activity, consistent with secondary disruptions in sphingolipid homeostasis. Collectively, our findings point to CNPY4 as a sphingolipid chaperone that regulates the abundance and localization of these lipids, modulating in turn cholesterol homeostasis and cellular signaling.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Here, our objective was to characterise bladder urothelial mucoadhesion and microtrauma associated with intermittent catheterisation. We employed our three-dimensional Urine-tolerant Human Urothelial model (3D-UHU) to investigate two different intermittent catheter types, a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-coated catheter (PVP-CC), and a coating-free integrated amphiphilic surfactant (IAS) catheter. We showed that pressing catheters onto the models for two minutes caused compression of the 3D-UHU model in contact regions, with disruption of urothelial umbrella cells detected by immunofluorescence staining of surface markers uroplakin III, cytokeratin-20 and chondroitin sulphate, alongside occasional effacement of apical surfaces exposing intermediate layers. PVP-CC had a significantly higher number of urothelial cells adhered to its surface after catheter removal compared with IAS. Moreover, application and removal of PVP-CC caused a decrease in transepithelial electrical resistance, suggesting barrier disruption, whereas IAS did not cause a statistically different effect. However, no change in paracellular permeability rates assessed by FITC-dextran were observed in models after application of catheter pieces. Finally, compression of models induced trauma-triggered inflammatory cytokine responses. Specifically, we observed increased secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1{beta} as well as the cell adhesion molecule CEACAM1 after exposure to PVP-CC compared with IAS. Our findings suggest that the IAS catheter damaged the epithelium less than the PVP-CC catheter.

However, some clocks showed dramatic drops in technical reliability based on differences in slide position and DNA extraction protocol. PC-based clocks, especially PCGrimAge and SystemsAge remained technically reliable in all cases. In contrast, biological reliability, measured across repeated samples collected within hours, before and after meals, under acute stress, across environmental exposures, and over days, was markedly lower, with most clocks showing only moderate stability. PCGrimAge was the only clock with good ICC > 0.75 for biological reliability. Importantly, technical reproducibility did not predict biological reliability; clocks that were technically robust often proved biologically unreliable. We further demonstrated that reliability directly constrains downstream applications. Clocks with higher ICCs produced more stable prognostic associations with cognitive decline and more consistent responsiveness to a vegan diet intervention, whereas unreliable clocks yielded highly variable or spurious effects. Together, these findings reveal that technical reliability is not enough: biological reliability remains a critical limitation for many DNA methylation clocks that constrains their utility, and our work provides a roadmap for prioritising next-generation clocks most suited for clinical translation.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

As a relatively new omics technology, bioinformatics has driven much of the innovation in ST. However, within these frameworks, spatial information is often reduced to locations and relationships between molecular profiles, without fully leveraging the wealth of sub-micron morphological detail and histological knowledge available. Advances in computer vision-based artificial intelligence (AI) are opening exciting new avenues beyond conventional bioinformatics approaches by modeling complex histological patterns and linking morphology to molecular states. More excitingly, they bring fresh perspectives to potentially address key limitations of ST, including its high cost, limited clinical applicability, and reliance on two-dimensional (2D) analysis of inherently three-dimensional (3D) tissues. For instance, models that predict ST directly from histology images enable virtual sequencing, drastically reducing costs while integrating morphological insights from pathology with molecular biomarkers, thus accelerating clinical translation. Moreover, computer vision techniques can reconstruct pixel-aligned 3D tissue models, overcoming the technical barriers of 2D acquisition and advancing 3D spatial omics analytics. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey of computer vision AI models for ST analytics, categorizing approaches across architectures, learning paradigms, tasks, and datasets, and tracing their technological evolution. We highlight key challenges and future directions, offering a panoramic perspective on vision-driven ST and its potential to transform both basic research and clinical practice.

We employ active subspace learning to identify linear projections of atomistic degrees of freedom that maximally describe gradients of the potential energy, yielding a reduced set of coarse-grained variables that capture the dominant collective motions across the potential of mean force. Effective coarse-grained forces and noise terms are obtained directly from the same projection, eliminating the need for separate parameterization schemes. We demonstrate the ASCG method on three biomolecules: dialanine, Trp-cage, and chignolin. We show that free energy surfaces are recapitulated with Jensen-Shannon divergences lower than 0.02 while reducing solute dimensionality by more than 90%. The ASCG trajectories are integrated with timesteps up to 500 fs, around an order of magnitude larger than those possible with conventional coarse-graining methods, while ASCG models remain accurate with as little as 50 ns of training data. These results establish ASCG as a robust, data-efficient approach for learning complete coarse-grained representations directly from molecular forces, while representing a departure from traditional particle-based models.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

In plants, this is achieved, in part, by circadian clock-mediated regulation, such as the synthesis of and response to the immune hormone salicylic acid (SA)1,2. Application of SA at the same concentration under light/dark cycles induces immunity with minimal impact on growth, however, prolonged darkness leads to plant death2. To uncover what determines this life-or-death outcome, we identified twenty survival of SA-induced death (ssd) mutants through genetic screening. These mutants are defective in starch, glucose, and nitrate metabolism, and circadian regulation, and accumulate excessive starch and/or glucose. Likewise, glucose application rescues SA-treated plants in prolonged darkness. Surprisingly, SA treatment does not deplete glucose, but instead, induces amino acid and fatty acid catabolism. Through transcriptomic analyses of glucose-rescued WT plants and ssd mutants for shared pathways, we found that SA triggers plant death in darkness by inducing oxidative stress, and water loss, while glucose antagonizes these processes, boosts ER protein processing and re-establishes the anabolism-catabolism balance. Interestingly, the programmed cell death induced by effector-triggered immunity shares common transcriptomic patterns with those observed during SA-induced cell death in darkness and could also be attenuated by glucose treatment. Therefore, coordination with the cellular metabolic context plays a central role in determining immune outcomes and optimizing plant health.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Nevertheless, rhythmic bursting in these VLPO neurons has never been observed. Here, we report that ~12% of VLPO neurons in a large database of ex vivo patch-clamp recordings display spontaneous rhythmic bursting of action potentials. This activity occurred in putative sleep-promoting neurons, identified by inhibitory responses to noradrenaline (NA), as well as wake-active neurons that were activated by NA. Unsupervised clustering of 24 neurons based on burst properties, electrophysiological, and morphological features revealed three distinct groups: one corresponding to putative sleep-promoting neurons and two wake-active neurons with fast and slow bursting dynamics. Strikingly, membrane potential oscillations persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), indicating that rhythmic bursting is driven by intrinsic mechanisms rather than network activity. These findings suggest that rhythmic bursting is an intrinsic and functionally relevant mode of activity in VLPO neurons, which may contribute to sleep regulation.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

CDC1s promote CD8+ T cell cross-priming against tumor antigens and are therefore being explored for use in immunotherapy. We evaluated the impact of ex-vivo stimulation on human peripheral blood cDC1s. In contrast to routine evaluation, which focuses on pre-defined surface maturation markers or soluble factors released from the activated cells, we investigated the impact of stimulation on the transcriptome using both RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and microarrays. Specifically, we analyzed the mRNA of cDC1 upon activation with two clinical-grade adjuvants, Hiltonol (poly IC, a TLR3 ligand) and protamine-stabilized RNA (pRNA, a TLR7/8 ligand) compared to unstimulated controls. Both RNA-seq and microarray analysis showed profound and similar effects of both Hiltonol and pRNA on the transcriptome of cDC1s. A gene ontology analysis suggested that these changes were mainly related to activation and maturation pathways, including induction of type-I interferon and interleukin-12 transcription, while pathways related to adverse effects or cell damage did not appear to be affected. Combination of both reagents did not appear to have a synergistic effect, as the transcriptome changes were similar to those induced by each stimulus alone.

Here, we dissect the basis of this context dependency in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In the homothallic h90 strain, regarded as wild type, mating-type switching (MTS) occurs every other cell division and requires HR to repair programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) at the mat1 locus. We show that the widely used heterothallic h-S strain is likewise dependent on HR for viability. HR-deficient h-S mutants (rad51{Delta}, rad52{Delta}, or rad54{Delta}), still frequently employed in the literature, survive only when carrying secondary suppressor mutations that abolish mat1 DSB formation, such as smt-0, swi1{Delta}, or fml1{Delta}. In contrast, HR is dispensable in the h+N strain, where duplication of the mat2/3 region into mat1 introduces the cenH and REIII elements. These elements nucleate H3K9 methylation and heterochromatin spreading across the imprint site, blocking imprintosome recruitment and thereby preventing both imprinting and DSB formation. Disruption of this heterochromatin, via deletion of cenH or key chromatin modifiers, restores DSB formation in h+N cells and reinstates HR essentiality in the absence of the Clr4 methyltransferase. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that HR is indispensable for S. pombe survival due to its critical role in repairing mat1 DSBs, except under genetic or epigenetic conditions that suppress their formation.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

A.; Wennemuth, G.; Chung, J.-J.", "abstract": "The intracellular carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) and GPI-anchored extracellular carbonic anhydrase IV (CAIV) are distinctly compartmentalized enzymes that regulate bicarbonate (HCO3-) and acid-base homeostasis. Located in the epithelial cells of the epididymis, vas deferens, and on spermatozoa, these enzymes are positioned to regulate the pH environment critical for sperm maturation and capacitation, crucial for male reproduction. This regulation is essential for early sperm activation, as bicarbonate (HCO3-) triggers the soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC)/cAMP signaling pathways and leads to an increase in intracellular pH (pHi), a prerequisite for motility. However, the specific contributions of CAII and CAIV to luminal pH and to sperm pHi regulation remain unclear. Here, we show that genetic ablation of either CAII or CAIV in mice results in a loss of normal luminal acidification in the male reproductive tract but, paradoxically, also lowers the basal pHi of sperm. This lower basal pHi reduces the effectiveness of subsequent intracellular alkalinization, thereby diminishing the activation of pH-sensitive sperm CatSper Ca2+ channels essential for capacitation and male fertility. We further establish a direct link between CAIV and the Slo3 K+ channel, as Slo3-deficient sperm exhibit reduced pHi and decreased CAIV protein levels. In contrast, sperm lacking the CatSper Ca2+ channel show no change in CAII, CAIV, or pHi. Super-resolution imaging reveals that CAII is located within the flagellum near the CatSper channel in the principal piece, while CAIV is distributed along the entire flagellar membrane. Our study demonstrates that CAII and CAIV employ coordinated and spatially distinct mechanisms to regulate pH. By maintaining an acidic luminal environment for sperm maturation and triggering the subsequent alkalinization of sperm pHi, these enzymes modulate ion channel activity, thereby regulating sperm motility and fertility.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

In this study, we combine bioassays, micro-CT imaging, and elastic wave modelling to investigate how the subterranean termite Coptotermes acinaciformis evaluates wood through structuralwave propagation. Using an axially excited Acoustic Black Hole (ABH), a tapered geometry that minimises wave reflections and effectively mimics an infinitely long food source, we show that termites preferentially attack longer wooden dowels and, remarkably, also lighter ABH-modified dowels. Micro-CT scans revealed feeding concentrated in the dowel core, coinciding with the region of maximum stress predicted by the models but where echo return was minimal. These results indicate that termites assess wood size through bite-induced echoes, analogous to echolocation in bats and dolphins, and preferentially exploit core regions of trunks and branches, thereby accounting for the tree-piping behaviour of termites. The reduction or absence of reflected waves may thus act as a cue that stimulates collective stigmergic foraging.

We found that homodyne epi-coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (epi-CARS) microscopy, when focused as interfaces, has intrinsic interfacial selectivity. The interference of the back-reflected nonresonant signals amplifies the contrast of cell adhesion areas, generating a distinctive negative contrast at attachment areas, which reflects the distance between the cell membrane and the substrate with tens of nanometers precision. The Epi-CARS configuration also provides high contrasts for cellular lipid droplets when applied in the inverted microscope configuration. Furthermore, by incorporating a pinhole into our confocal epi-CARS system, we can effectively reject out-of-focus reflections that degrade epi-CARS image quality, allowing us to amplify adhesion and lipid droplet contrasts for complex samples, such as cells. We applied this method to study cell-substrate adhesion dynamics of mitotic cells, revealing adhesion site splitting during mitosis and their outward development during postmitotic spreading.

Factors such as age, sex and obesity are associated with TMJ OA, however, the underling mechanisms, particularly the contribution of obesity, remain poorly understood. Unlike weight-bearing joints, TMJ pathology cannot be fully attributed to aberrant mechanical loading, suggesting a potential involvement of systemic metabolic factor. Evidence have linked metabolic endotoxemia, characterized by subclinical elevation of plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level to low-grade systemic inflammation, adipose tissue dysfunction and adipokine dysregulation. Among adipokines, circulating leptin has been associated with OA progression, but its role in the onset and progression of TMJ OA, especially in a sex-specific context, is under studied. In this study, we examined whether chronic systemic LPS could induce adipose tissue abnormalities and leptin signalling dysregulation, contributing to TMJ OA. The metabolic endotoxemia was induced in 6-month-old female and male Wistar rats via systemic LPS delivery for 6 weeks using subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps. At the end of the study, the peripheral blood, subcutaneous and visceral white adipose tissue, and TMJs were harvested for various analyses. We showed that LPS-treated female rats showed elevated circulating LPS and adipocyte hypertrophy in white adipose tissue. This was accompanied by increased plasma leptin concentrations. These changes were not observed in male rats. Histological evaluation of TMJ revealed pronounced osteoarthritic changes in TMJ, characterized by cartilage matrix loss, subchondral bone resorption, and synovial inflammation, in female but not male rats. Immunofluorescence staining discovered differences in the distribution and expression of nitric oxide and leptin receptor in cartilage between sexes. Correlation analysis suggested the involvement of leptin in TMJ OA.

Here, we model this to show that early-life treatment with a single dose of the commonly used chemotherapy cisplatin profoundly impairs late-life bone health, and that these bone deficits are completely resolved through treatment with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) precursor nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). While we had previously shown that this same strategy protects against chemotherapy induced female infertility, this maintenance of aged bone health does not appear to be related to endocrine changes due to protection of the ovarian reserve. Instead, this is driven by altered phosphorus homeostasis and protection against renal damage, which otherwise increases parathyroid hormone secretion to mobilise calcium stores from bone.

Functional connectivity from both hippocampi to primarily right prefrontal regions during verbal encoding associated with better CVLT performance. In-scanner word recognition accuracy was more strongly associated with activation of parietal and occipital regions, and with functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and bilateral parietal and temporal regions.

Crop domestication has fundamentally transformed plant phenotypes through artificial selection, yet the consequences of domestication for plant-associated microbial communities across the plant-soil continuum remain poorly understood. Gap Statement. While recent studies suggest that domestication impacts microbiome structures, the magnitude, mechanisms, and functional implications of such impacts have not been systematically quantified using controlled experimental designs that eliminate environmental confounding factors. Aim. To characterize and quantify the effects of crop domestication on microbial community structure and function by comparing maize (Zea mays subsp. mays) and its wild ancestor Balsas teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis) across multiple plant compartments in an unmanipulated field setting in Mexico, maize's domestication center. Methodology. We applied a micro-sympatric design in a natural setting to compare microbial communities between maize and Balsas teosinte across five plant compartments: bulk soil, rhizosphere, mucilage, leaves, and seeds. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used for taxonomic characterization, Functional Annotation of Prokaryotic Taxa (FAPROTAX) and PICRUSt 2.0 were used to predict functional profiles, and network analysis was used to assess functional connectivity. Results. Compartment identity explained 72.2% of variation in community structure, with consistent host effects across all niches (9.0%). Teosinte maintained significantly higher microbial diversity than maize across all compartments, with pronounced differences in seeds (32.0 vs 9.3 species, P < 0.01) and rhizosphere (60.3 vs 33.8 species, P < 0.01). Eighty-nine percent of predicted metabolic functions showed significant changes associated with domestication, with teosinte exhibiting enhanced nitrogen fixation (0.89 vs 0.44 in maize mucilage), siderophore production, and pathogen suppression. Network analysis revealed functional fragmentation in maize, with reduced connections (80 to 49) and lower clustering coefficients (0.62 vs 0.25, P < 0.001). Conclusion. Balsas teosinte domestication fundamentally eroded microbial diversity and functional capacity in maize leading to a \"domestication gap\" that encompasses taxonomic loss, functional simplification, and network fragmentation, and replaced mutualistic plant-microbe partnerships with simplified microbial assemblages that may compromise crop resilience vis-a-vis a changing climate.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Murine mouse models have been essential to the study of S. aureus virulence but are not without their limitations. In murine pneumonia models, colonization of the lungs by S. aureus are generally not well maintained. To increase the level and duration of S. aureus respiratory colonization, various methods have been employed including embedding the bacteria in agar beads and suppressing the mouse immune system. These modifications have improved colonization, but they do not accurately represent clinical infections of diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF). We hypothesize that culturing S. aureus in a different media such as Synthetic CF Medium 2 (SCFM2) would increase colonization compared to growing the bacteria on standard rich media agar plates. We observed that culturing 6 different S. aureus strains in SCFM2 led to either a neutral or increased level of lung colonization compared to agar plates. For one strain, WU1, culturing in SCFM2 improved colonization in the oropharynx compared to agar plates and led to a sustained long-term infection in the lungs. Finally, when cultured in SCFM2 compared to agar plates, infection with WU1 led to increased inflammation in both the left and right lung lobe. Overall, we have shown that culturing S. aureus in different conditions prior to infection impacts colonization and host response.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Ulva sp. was harvested from Goan shores, and the bacterial strains were obtained from cheese and cultivated for use in fermentation. The rationale behind this study was to integrate the de novo synthesis of Vitamin B12 with the conversion of Vitamin B2 into 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), leading to higher production of Vitamin B12, with the BluB enzyme serving as the key connecting factor. Vitamin B12 in fermented Ulva sp. was quantified using HPLC with a C18 column at 361 nm, with acetonitrile and water as the mobile phase. The highest concentration was observed after 72 hours of fermentation, reaching 19.6 mcg/mL, approximately five times higher than the control.

This study elucidates the manganese homeostasis system in S. maltophilia strain Sm18, a Mexican environmental isolate, revealing a sophisticated network that includes both conserved and novel components. We focus on the MntR miniregulon, which comprises the well-known inner-membrane importer MntH and exporter MntP, regulated by the Mn2+-responsive MntR metalloregulator. However, it also contains a TonB-dependent receptor (TBDR) with a distinctive CQNC motif likely involved in Mn2+ coordination and a periplasmic thioredoxin-fold protein (TFP). Both are coexpressed from a bicistronic operon under severe manganese and iron limitation and belong to novel families with a limited phyletic distribution. Transcriptomic profiling under varying manganese and iron concentrations revealed a tight interplay between these metals, emphasizing the ferrophilic nature of S. maltophilia and the differential expression of the MntR miniregulon core members. Additional transporters of the RND and CDF families were also modulated under dual metal limitation. Mutant analysis demonstrated that MntP is critical for survival, even at Mn levels that do not affect growth kinetics. MntH is required for optimal intracellular replication within Acanthamoeba castellanii phagosomes, highlighting its role in overcoming nutritional immunity.

However, forest-to-agriculture conversion changes plant-microbe-soil interactions, affecting P cycling, which may additionally changed by land-use intensity. This study examined the 30-year effects of converting a primary forest into two contrasting systems: a low-intensity agroforest and a high-intensity citrus plantation. We investigated how microbial and water-extractable organic matter (WEOM) composition interacted with soil physicochemical attributes and P fractions (labile, moderately labile, non-labile, and residual). Agroforest soils retained physicochemical and enzymatic attributes similar to the primary forest, while soils of the citrus plantation showed increased P in all fractions due to fertilization and reduced soil organic matter content, mainly in deeper layers. Microbial and WEOM composition patterns reflected land-use, with agroforest representing an intermediate state between primary forest and citrus plantation. Proteobacteria and nutrient-rich WEOM were more abundant in the agroforest, whereas Ascomycota and nutrient-poor WEOM predominated the citrus plantation. Genes related to P acquisition were more abundant in agroforest soils, while genes related to P-compound synthesis were more abundant in citrus plantation. Labile P was negatively correlated with genes related to microbial metabolism, suggesting that reduced P availability may induce a boost in microbial activity for internal P-cycling. These findings demonstrate that forest-to-agriculture conversion strongly affects microbial functions, with responses aligning with land-use intensity and WEOM resource availability. Nonetheless, microbes adapt by shifting strategies: prioritizing mineralization and solubilization or favoring biosynthesis depending on P availability.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

These relationships rely on bacterial navigation of complex, dynamic soil environments to reach their plant hosts. Central to this behavior are bacterial motility and chemotaxis, the ability to sense and move toward host-derived signals in the rhizosphere. In the soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA110, motility is controlled by dual flagellar systems, and this strain contains three putative but uncharacterized chemotaxis operons (che1, che2, and che3). Using targeted deletions of all three predicted cheA genes, we show that cheA2 is the primary driver of chemotaxis toward soybean seed exudate in soft agar assays, and that the greater contribution of cheA2 vs. cheA1 in soft agar chemotaxis is due to its genomic context. Interestingly, we also found that B. diazoefficiens mutants that are incapable of chemotaxis in semisolid media retain wild type-like swimming speeds in aqueous media.

While HCN2 exhibits strong cAMP regulation, HCN1 shows minimal response.

One variant (HCN112) incorporates the C-linker and CNBD from HCN2 into the HCN1 backbone and exhibited enhanced cAMP sensitivity, with structural analysis revealing a compressed cytoplasmic domain arrangement that may facilitate regulatory interactions. In contrast, the truncated HCN1{Delta}C variant (lacking the cytoplasmic domain) displayed an intermediately open pore conformation, supporting auto-inhibitory regulation by the CNBD in wild-type channels. These structural insights elucidate how domain-specific interactions modulate cAMP-dependent gating and intrinsic auto-inhibition, resolving long-standing questions about mechanistic divergence among HCN isoforms.

The cytoplasmic variant, CyKILRb (exon 3 exclusion), promotes tumorigenesis, whereas the nuclear variant, CyKILRa (exon 3 inclusion), functions as a tumor suppressor. In this study, the molecular mechanism of the tumorigenic role of CyKILRb was characterized. Specifically, deep RNA sequencing analysis revealed that CyKILRb regulated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway to block downstream tumor suppressors. In particular, downregulation of CyKILRb induced the loss of PIK3R2, an activator of PI3K, as well as RPS6KB2 and GNB2, two implicated tumor promotors, with a concomitant increase in the tumor suppressors, CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN1B (p27). In contrast, CyKILRb ectopic expression produced the opposite effect, and suppression of either PIK3R2, PI3K or AKT attenuated CyKILRb-induced cell proliferation and clonogenic survival. CyKILRb negatively regulated CyKILRa expression, which was blocked by inhibition of either PI3K or AKT. PIK3R2 ectopic expression overcame the cellular effects of CyKILRb downregulation, but not PI3K or AKT inhibition orienting the signaling pathway from CyKILRb[-&gt;]{uparrow}PIK3R2[-&gt;]PI3K[-&gt;]AKT[-&gt;]{downarrow}CyKILRa[-&gt;]enhanced oncogenicity.

These organisms are surrounded by a unique cell envelope architecture that includes a two-layered cell wall composed of peptidoglycan (PG) and arabinogalactan. They also build an outer membrane called the mycomembrane that is made of mycolic acids. Mycolate outer membrane proteins (MOMPs) reside within the mycomembrane and a subset are thought to form pores that allow essential nutrients to permeate the envelope. However, little is known about the structure of these proteins or the mechanism by which they are assembled. Here, we investigate MOMP assembly in the model organism Corynebacterium glutamicum (Cglu) using PorH as a model MOMP. PorH is encoded in an operon with the MOMP PorA, and the two small, alpha-helical proteins have been proposed to form hetero-oligomeric pores in the mycomembrane. Consistent with this proposal, AlphaFold2 predicts a high confidence structure of a hetero-oligomeric pore formed by five copies each of PorH and its partner PorA, and we show that PorA is required for the surface assembly of PorH. Using a fluorescence assay for detection of surface-exposed PorH or another MOMP called ProtX, we found that MOMP assembly occurs within zones of active PG synthesis at the cell poles. We also discovered that PorH and ProtX are linked to the cell wall.

Recent work has shown that interactions between bacterial metabolism and growth explain IE in bacteria that lack acquired resistance, such as {beta}-lactamases. Owing to the energetic costs associated with production, the expression of {beta}-lactamases can perturb metabolism and growth rate, which may impact their relationship with IE. Indeed, the presence of a {beta}-lactamase does not guarantee IE, suggesting additional aspects of bacterial physiology are at play. Using Escherichia coli expressing the NDM-1 {beta}-lactamase, we quantified [ATP], growth rate, {beta}-lactamase expression, and IE across multiple environments defined by the chemical composition of the growth medium. We found that expression of {beta}-lactamases nonlinearly impacted both [ATP] and growth rate, but neither alone could predict IE. Instead, we found that the ratio of [ATP] to growth rate formed a biphasic relationship with the strength of IE. Mathematical modeling suggests that IE initially increases with the ratio of [ATP] to growth rate due to increased {beta}-lactamase expression, which increasingly protects the population from antibiotics. However, once metabolism becomes sufficiently high, the ability of {beta}-lactamases to protect the population is reduced, which decreases IE. Our results suggest that the chemical composition of the environment influences IE in {beta}-lactamase-expressing bacteria, potentially resolving conflicting reports on the clinical relevance of IE.

B.; Dasgupta, S.; Bhaumik, P.", "abstract": "Membrane Attack Complex/Perforin (MACPF) domain proteins are {beta}-pore forming toxins ({beta}-PFTs) involved in the pathogenesis of various organisms. Among them, Perforin-like proteins (PLPs), produced by Plasmodium species, play essential roles in parasite invasion and egress. Due to increasing drug resistance in Plasmodium, PLPs represent promising but underexplored therapeutic targets, largely due to the lack of structural and mechanistic data. This study investigates the binding and pore formation mechanism of the Plasmodium falciparum PLP1 (PfPLP1), which is expressed during the human life cycle of the parasite. We modeled PfPLP1 structure and performed both all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations in soluble and membrane-associated states. PfPLP1 comprises two domains, a canonical MACPF domain and a {beta}-pleated sheet domain- apicomplexan perforin {beta}-domain (APC{beta}). Initial membrane binding is mediated by cationic residues at the base of the APC{beta} domain, which interact with the polar headgroups of the lipids from the host cell membrane. We analyzed the membrane-inserted tetrameric form where water molecules were observed to penetrate between the tetramer and the lipid bilayer, initiating pore opening. During this process, lipids reorganize into a toroidal edge to shield their hydrophobic tails, while water mixes with lipid headgroups in a disordered, heterogeneous fashion. Larger oligomeric assemblies show lateral displacement of lipids and a clear tendency to form pore-like structures. This study provides molecular insights into PfPLP1's membrane binding and pore-forming behavior in both monomeric and oligomeric forms. The outcome of this study would be applicable in understanding pore formation mechanism in other PLPs and similar toxins.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

K.; Velieva, A.; Liu, Y.-C.; Roy, A.; Chavali, R.; Loebel, C.", "abstract": "The endometrium, the mucosal lining of the uterus, is a highly regenerative tissue that undergoes cyclic remodeling guided by tightly regulated levels of estrogen and progesterone. Stromal cells are embedded within the connective tissue of the endometrium and contribute to the rapidly changing extracellular matrix (ECM). With hormone exposure, endometrial stromal cells undergo decidualization, which alters their morphology and protein secretion. While an increase in tissue modulus is associated with gynecological diseases, the relationship between mechanical properties, hormone exposure, and ECM deposition remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how both stiffness and hormones regulate ECM deposition by human endometrial stromal cells during decidualization. Using metabolic labeling with sugar analogs and click chemistry, we measure newly secreted ECM proteins deposited by endometrial stromal cells during decidualization. Additionally, we study the nascent ECM in response to different mechanical properties using hyaluronic acid hydrogels. To increase throughput and reproducibility, we designed an automated ImageJ-based workflow for unbiased quantification of nascent ECM deposition. Our results demonstrate that hormones induce decidualization, characterized by F-actin stress fiber formation and prolactin secretion. In addition, we show that decidualization on hydrogels is characterized by an increase in nascent ECM deposition which depends on the initial hydrogel modulus. In contrast, endometrial stromal cells on glass show little change in nascent ECM deposition during hormone exposure. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that both mechanical and biochemical cues regulate ECM deposition during endometrial remodeling. These observations may provide new insights towards future studies addressing the mechanisms of ECM remodeling in gynecological diseases.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Ants exhibit remarkable collective and social behaviors, such as alloparental care, chemical communication, homing, and cooperative group hygiene. The clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi is especially well-suited for investigating the neuronal and genetic underpinnings of these behaviors. Unlike most ant species, O. biroi lacks a queen caste. Instead, colonies consist entirely of regular workers and slightly larger intercaste workers. All workers reproduce in synchrony via parthenogenesis, giving rise to age-matched cohorts of clonally identical offspring. This unique life history enables precise experimental control over age, genotype, and colony composition. These features have also facilitated the introduction of genetically encoded calcium indicators into O. biroi, enabling in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate the neural basis of social behaviors. Despite its promise as a neuroscience model, the structure of the clonal raider ant brain has not been systematically characterized, and a representative reference brain does not exist. To address this gap, we imaged the brains of 40 age-matched, genetically identical individuals with confocal microscopy and, using 3D groupwise registration, generated the first reference brain for the species. We introduce a registration pipeline to align brains to this reference, facilitating the comparison of anatomical features across labeling experiments with high spatial precision. Unexpectedly, despite homogeneity in genotype, age, and external morphology, we discovered extensive interindividual variability across our collection of brain samples. This raises the possibility that behavioral division of labor in O. biroi is linked to individual differences in brain structure. This work provides a powerful resource for the emerging clonal raider ant neuroscience community and reveals novel features of the species' neurobiology that may influence social behaviors and colony function.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Spores are known to exhibit memory in germination, as spores given an initial short germinant pulse respond more readily to a second pulse. We have developed a mathematical model to identify a minimal reconstructed molecular network that is crucial for germination kinetics leading to memory of germinant exposure; the model reproduces experimental double germinant pulse germination curves. Analysis of the reconstructed network indicates that a minimal set of inactive and active GRs and a SpoVA channel in three states - closed inactive, closed active and open - is needed to reproduce memory. Spore germination memory is introduced in the network by the activation and deactivation rates of GRs, and by the interplay between activation of closed SpoVA channels and their rate of opening and closing.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Here we examined how the microbiota influences D. melanogaster seasonal adaptation by rearing flies in outdoor mesocosms, fed diets inoculated with different bacterial strains that have distinct influences on the flies' life history. The bacterial treatments influenced fly population dynamics and microbiota composition over a summer-to-fall season. The developmental phenotype of the treated flies initially differed but converged over time in flies reared with a complete microbial community. Conversely, rearing the flies free of their colonizing microorganisms revealed that the bacterial treatments led to evolution of distinct developmental phenotypes. The development time of flies from the different treatments consistently adapted to compensate for the direct influence of the bacteria on host development; e.g., flies evolved faster development times if they were inoculated with microbes that slowed development. This compensatory trend was apparent in flies reared in a second location and season, and is consistent with a previous report of wild-sampled flies whose development phenotype segregated with their microbiota composition. Together, these results reveal that microbiota-dependent selection consistently elicits compensatory adaptation in seasonally-evolving flies, which we conclude is a mechanism whereby horizontally-acquired, low-fidelity microbial partners can shape the evolution of their animal hosts.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

The amino acids encoded by the cDNA retains conserved catalytic residues of acetyltransferases although sharing only 34% identity with mammalian orthologs.

Knockdown of SjHAT1 impairs worm survival, reduces female oviposition and disrupts ovarian and vitelline morphology both in vitro and in vivo.

R.; Quinones-Diaz, B. I.; Contreras, L. M.", "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are environmentally ubiquitous and known to have pervasive impacts on cellular homeostasis. RNA is vulnerable to oxidative chemical alterations from a variety of endogenous and exogenous sources. The most common chemical modification resulting from ROS exposure to RNA is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG)--an oxidized form of the canonical guanine (G) nucleobase. While 8-oxoG modifications are known to impact mRNA processing, understanding the broader biological impact of 8-oxoG requires knowledge of how these modifications accumulate. In this work, we assessed the disparate enrichment of 8-oxoG modifications within RNAs in the E. coli transcriptome using an RNA Immunoprecipitation Sequencing technique with a high-affinity 8-oxoG antibody (8-oxoG-RIP-Seq). Our investigation of the RNA 8-oxoG enrichment landscape uncovered several intrinsic RNA characteristics that correlate with 8-oxoG enrichment. These findings suggest intrinsic characteristics of RNA, most notably relative abundance, CDS length, and G nucleotide composition, significantly influence RNA 8-oxoG accumulation. We harnessed these intrinsic characteristics to construct a simple multiple linear regression model that predicts RNA 8-oxoG accumulation, which we validated in E. coli. This model was subsequently applied to predict 8-oxoG enriched RNA species in four other bacterial species spanning a wide range of oxidative stress tolerances; these predictions suggest that 8-oxoG accumulation is largely species dependent, with limited overlap in RNAs and functional pathways that are more susceptible to elevated levels of 8-oxoG accumulation. Overall, these findings better inform understanding of RNA 8-oxoG patterns in bacteria and have broader impacts towards advancing knowledge of the connection between RNA oxidation and cellular homeostasis.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

ZNFX1 also functions as a bi-catalytic E3 ubiquitin ligase, containing an RZ-finger homologous to RNF213 and a previously unidentified Miz-like domain that catalyze ubiquitylation independently or cooperatively, with activity enhanced by ubiquitin chains. Patient mutations demonstrate that the helicase, E3 ligase, and rigid zinc-finger stalk connecting them are required for function. ZNFX1 can assemble into structured, pleiomorphic polymers via multivalent protein-protein interactions, revealing a mechanism that may facilitate RNA sequestration in stress granules and antiviral activity.

In this study, we applied optimized immunoblotting protocols using both CTD110.6 and RL2 O-GlcNAc antibodies, alongside subcellular fractionation, to investigate temporal and sex-specific changes in cardiac O-GlcNAcylation during pressure overload hypertrophy (POH) from transverse aortic constriction (TAC) during early (1-week POH, 1wTAC) and chonic (6-weeks POH, 6wTAC) POH in mice. Global O-GlcNAc levels were elevated in early POH and returned to baseline in chronic POH, consistent across both antibodies and sexes. Subcellular fractionation revealed persistent O-GlcNAc elevations in cytoplasmic and membrane fractions in chronic POH for both sexes, which were not detected in unfractionated samples. Female mice exhibited significantly higher O-GlcNAc levels than males during POH, particularly at early POH, highlighting sex-specific regulation. OGT and OGA protein levels also varied by compartment and sex, suggesting differential enzymatic control. In conclusion, our findings underscore the importance of methodological rigor in O-GlcNAc detection and demonstrate that fractionation enhances sensitivity to subtle changes in cardiac O-GlcNAcylation.

They are unusually stable due to carbon-fluorine bonds and resistant to degradation, making them persistent contaminants in water, soil, and biota. PFAS are associated with adverse health effects in humans including cancer and liver disease. The effects of PFAS on human-associated bacteria are largely unexplored, a significant gap in knowledge because these bacteria are exposed to PFAS in vivo at sites including the colon and bladder. One of the best studied PFAS compounds is perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), an eight-carbon perfluorinated carboxylic acid whose structure is analogous to a fatty acid. Here, we cultured Enterococcus faecalis, a Gram-positive bacterium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium, in growth medium supplemented with PFOA and corresponding control conditions and performed lipidomic analyses using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to elucidate lipid remodeling in response to PFOA exposure. Strikingly, novel fluoroalkyl-containing membrane lipids are synthesized by both of these bacteria, with each species synthesizing unique fluoroalkyl-lipids. Moreover, a high-level daptomycin-resistant strain of E. faecalis produces strikingly high levels of fluoroalkyl-lipids, demonstrating that prior antibiotic exposure and concomitant effects on bacterial evolution can alter bacterial interactions with PFAS. Because bacterial lipids are important immunomodulators in vivo, we propose that PFAS-containing bacterial lipids may be novel mediators of host-microbe-pollutant interactions.

Yet, identifying corresponding cells across embryos has so far relied on slow, manual annotation following the Conklin nomenclature, which limits scalability and consistency. We present an automated framework that assigns cell identities in three-dimensional time-lapse reconstructions of ascidian embryos by transferring names from a reference set of manually curated embryos. The process operates in two steps: an initiation phase, which globally aligns early embryos to establish initial correspondences, and a propagation phase, which propagates names through time and cell divisions by comparing the pattern of contacts each cell forms with its neighbors. Applied to eight wild-type Phallusia mammillata and one Ascidiella aspersa embryo, the pipeline assigns consistent names up to stages containing about 700 cells, corrects inconsistencies in earlier datasets, and extends Conklin's rules to internal tissues beyond gastrulation. Using this unified reference, we quantify natural variability in division timing and orientation, confirming the global robustness and revealing local variability of ascidian morphogenesis. The same framework also demonstrates its use to quantitatively phenotype experimentally perturbed embryos, such as those with inhibited ERK signaling.

We found that NE acts via 2-adrenergic receptors to strongly reduce excitatory postsynaptic currents from BLA to MDm. NE also decreases the release probability of BLA axon terminals through a presynaptic mechanism. Postsynaptically, NE depolarizes MDm neurons and increases their tonic firing rates.

Whole-brain analyses revealed greater activation for externalized compared to internalized sound sources in the left superior temporal gyrus, including the planum temporale, the cerebellum and the left posterior cingulate gyrus. Internalized sounds elicited greater relative activity in the left inferior temporal gyrus. Direct comparison between the two externalized conditions revealed stronger left superior temporal gyrus activation for reverberant sounds, while anechoic sounds preferentially activated the right middle temporal gyrus. These findings confirmed the key role of the planum temporale in auditory externalization and the involvement of higher-order brain regions, suggesting broader networks underpinning the perception of sound location.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Targeting this aberrant methylation may be a potential therapeutic strategy. EBV+ gastric cancer cell lines (YCCEL1, SNU719) and EBV- lines (AGS, SNU16, MKN74) were treated with a DNA methyl-transferase inhibitor (DNMT), decitabine (DCB), for three days followed by RNA sequencing to identify EBV-specific responses. DNA methylation profiling by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was performed in EBV+ cell-lines and integrated with expression data to identify epigenetically regulated networks. While DCB induced broad transcriptional changes across all lines, EBV+ cells exhibited the strongest transcriptional response, sharing many upregulated genes. Many of these EBV+ specific genes were expressed at lower baseline levels in EBV+ tumors from TCGA. DCB predominantly reduced methylation at highly methylated intergenic CpGs, with a subset of promoters undergoing significant demethylation. Integrated analysis revealed a strong inverse correlation between promoter demethylation and gene expression, implicating multiple cancer-relevant pathways. Upstream regulator analysis and motif enrichment indicated that regions losing methylation were enriched for retinoic acid receptor  (RAR) binding motifs, suggesting that DCB-mediated demethylation restores RA pathway accessibility and transcriptional activity. Further, inhibiting RAR signaling reduced DCB induced apoptosis. Although DCB can induce both host gene re-expression and viral lytic gene activation in EBV-positive tumors, its impact on RA signaling in EBVaGC has not been studied. Decitabine promotes extensive epigenetic reprogramming in EBVaGC, with preferential effects in CIMP-positive, EBV-infected cell lines.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

In this study, we first established the essential role of the BubR1 TPR domain in SAC signaling. Guided by the resolved cryo-EM structure of the MCC-APC/C complex, we identified and characterized several interactions involving this domain with Mad2, Cdc20APC/C, Apc2. Furthermore, we discovered an intramolecular interaction between the TPR domain and downstream residues of BubR1, which appears to organize a structure resembling a lasso that incorporates four Cdc20APC/C-binding elements, thereby enhancing engagement with Cdc20 in the APC/C. Functional and biochemical analyses demonstrated that these interactions collectively promote MCC assembly and MCC-APC/C binding, enabling rapid SAC activation in response to microtubule-kinetochore attachment defects.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Thus, the spatial organization of PRLR could have strong implications on signaling output. Internalization has been shown and modeled in other signaling pathways but has not been considered in a mathematical model of PRLR signaling. Here, we use live-cell fluorescence imaging, reconstitution approaches, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to inform a mathematical model of PRLR signaling. Internal PRLR localization is observed in primary pancreatic tissue and in an engineered PRLR expression system. Our imaging data indicate the presence of intracellular and plasma membrane-bound receptor populations. We use FCS to resolve the membrane-bound PRLR population. Based on our data, we include internalization dynamics within an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of PRLR signaling. We employ the model to explore how the spatial heterogeneity of PRLR affects downstream signaling. We show that the model is more sensitive to PRLR trafficking rates and ability to promote signaling than to its initial spatial distribution.

P.", "abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive liver disease driven by hepatocellular lipid overload, immune activation, and hepatic stellate cell (HSC)-driven fibrogenesis. Human genetic studies reveal that loss-of-function (LoF) variants in 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 13 (HSD17B13) confer robust protection against advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis, establishing HSD17B13 as a critical genetic modifier of MASH severity. Yet the mechanisms linking HSD17B13 activity to fibrogenic progression remain poorly understood. Here, we show that both wild-type and catalytically deficient HSD17B13 (mHSD) localize to lipid droplets (LDs) in cultured human hepatocytes, but only catalytically active HSD17B13 enhances hepatocellular lipid accumulation and markedly upregulates the lipogenic transcriptional regulator carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein (ChREBP). This HSD17B13-driven lipogenic axis elicits potent paracrine activation of LX2 stellate cells, both in hepatocyte-HSC co-culture and in response to hepatocyte-conditioned medium (CM). Screening of candidate signaling mediators revealed that transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFb-1) is uniquely and strongly upregulated by active HSD17B13, with minimal induction by mHSD. Remarkably, siRNA-mediated knockdown of TGFB1 or neutralization of active TGFb-1 protein abolishes CM-induced LX2 activation and collagen synthesis. Collectively, these findings identify HSD17B13 as a dual metabolic and profibrotic effector that drives TGFb-1-dependent HSC activation, thereby linking hepatocellular lipid dysregulation to fibrogenic progression and providing a mechanistic framework for understanding how HSD17B13 contributes to MASH pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we use high-resolution lattice light-sheet fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis to quantify lineage-resolved mitotic spindle and chromosome segregation dynamics from the 2- to 64-cell stages in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos. While spindle length scales with cell size across both wild-type and size-perturbed embryos, chromosome segregation dynamics remain largely invariant, suggesting that distinct mechanisms govern these mitotic processes. Combining femtosecond laser ablation12,13 with large-scale electron tomography14, we find that central spindle microtubules mediate chromosome segregation dynamics and remain uncoupled from cell size across all stages of early development. In contrast, spindle elongation is driven by cortically anchored motor proteins and astral microtubules, rendering it sensitive to cell size12,13,15--17. Incorporating these experimental results into an extended stoichiometric model for both the spindle and chromosomes, we find that allowing only cell size and microtubule catastrophe rates to vary reproduces elongation dynamics across development. The same model also accounts for centrosome separation and pronuclear positioning in the one-cell C. elegans embryo18, spindle-length scaling across nematode species spanning ~100 million years of divergence17, and spindle rotation in human cells19.

FA also prevents other developmental malformations, including several alcohol-induced malformations in Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) models. Here, we show that FA acts through a direct metabolic link with retinoic acid (RA) synthesis. Using a pax3 knockdown Xenopus model of FA-rescueable NTDs, we show that RA or its precursors equally rescue these defects. Similarly, FA rescues alcohol-induced NTDs in a model previously shown to be rescued by RA. We identify the FA-metabolizing enzyme, formyl tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, encoded by the aldh1l1 gene, as essential for this rescue: FA upregulates aldh1l1 expression and RA biosynthesis, and loss of aldh1l1 abolishes the FA protective effect. Remarkably, human ALDH1L1 converts retinaldehyde to RA, and its overexpression restores neural tube closure in aldh1l1 knockdown embryos when retinaldehyde is provided. ALDH1L1 enables FA to restore normal proliferation of neural plate precursors, thereby preventing pathological expansion. These findings establish ALDH1L1 as a previously unrecognized enzymatic link between vitamin B9 and retinoic acid signaling, revealing how FA supplementation safeguards neural development and suggesting opportunities to refine preventive strategies for NTDs.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

M.; Humburg, P.; Liu, F.; Wehrhahn, M.; Tay, A.; Riordan, S.; Zhang, L.", "abstract": "Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Escherichia coli is a critical global health challenge, particularly in urinary tract infections, where first-line treatments are increasingly compromised. While horizontal gene transfer (HGT) via mobile genetic elements is a major driver of AMR, the genomic factors that may constrain resistance gene acquisition remain underexplored. CRISPR-Cas systems, which provide adaptive immunity against foreign DNA, could influence AMR dynamics, but their role in E. coli remains incompletely understood. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive whole-genome analysis of uropathogenic E. coli isolates, including a newly sequenced collection from Australian clinical samples and an independent, globally sourced validation cohort. Antimicrobial susceptibility profiles were integrated with CRISPR-Cas subtype classification, resistance gene burden, and mobile element content. Elastic net regression, adaptive lasso, and tree-based machine learning models were used to identify genomic predictors of resistance, with performance validated across both datasets. Results: CRISPR-Cas subtype I-F was consistently associated with susceptibility to antibiotics commonly acquired through HGT, including trimethoprim and ampicillin, and linked to lower ARG and MGE burden. In contrast, Type I-E arrays, especially when co-occurring with orphan I-F arrays, were associated with increased resistance. These associations remained robust after adjusting for phylogroup, plasmid content, and genomic background, and were validated across datasets. Conclusions: Subtype-specific CRISPR-Cas systems shape antibiotic resistance profiles in E. coli, with Type I-F functioning as a potential genomic barrier to ARG acquisition. These findings highlight CRISPR array typing as a novel biomarker for AMR risk prediction and surveillance, and suggest new opportunities for leveraging CRISPR-based mechanisms to limit resistance propagation in clinical contexts.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

To quantify human autosomal allele expression between individuals, we analyzed human allele-specific expression data from the GTEx project. For hundreds of genes, some individuals will express the gene biallelically, while many others may only express one allele or extreme bias towards one allele. We found gene-specific patterns of interindividual variation in allele bias. We found that some individuals have more genome-wide monoallelic/biased expression than others.

Phospholipid metabolism has long been recognized to maintain membrane fluidity, but whether it also acts to maintain the function of high-curvature lipids is not resolved. Here, we find that cells grown under hydrostatic pressure - used to artificially reduce lipid curvature - maintain lipidome curvature through metabolic acclimation. We first observed that manipulation of the lipidome curvature via the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) ratio affects high-pressure growth and viability of yeast independently of membrane fluidity. In wild-type cells, X-ray scattering measurements revealed an increased propensity for lipid extracts to form non-lamellar phases after extended pressure incubations. Unexpectedly, this change in phase behavior was not due to increased levels of PE, but of phosphatidylinositol (PI), the only major phospholipid class whose curvature had not been previously characterized. We found that PI is a non-bilayer lipid, with a negative curvature intermediate to that of PE and PC. Accounting for PI, mean lipidome curvature was defended in response to pressure by two distantly related yeasts. Lipidome curvature also responded to pressure in a human cancer cell line through ether phospholipid metabolism and chain remodeling, but not in bacterial cells. These findings indicate that eukaryotic phospholipid metabolism uses diverse mechanisms to maintain curvature frustration in cell membranes.", "date": "2025-10-14", "journal": ""}

Understanding which loci are particularly resilient to such forces may shed light on the traits that were important for humans throughout multiple time periods. Yet, detecting ancient selection events is challenging from modern and ancient DNA due to the data and/or signal being severely degraded. Here we use a domain-adaptive neural network (DANN) trained on simulated data and applied to ancient and modern DNA for sweep detection. We show that the DANN can account for simulation misspecification, or discrepancies between the simulations and real aDNA, thereby improving the ability to detect sweeps in real data. Application of the DANN to more than 800 ancient and modern human genomes spanning the last 7000 years recovered 16 known sweeps at loci including LCT, HLA, KITLG, and OCA2/HERC2, and revealed 32 novel sweeps. All identified sweeps were classified as hard, consistent with historically low population sizes. While some sweeps were lost over time, 14 sweeps at loci involved in a range of functions including neuronal, reproductive, pigmentation, and signaling traits were found to persist from the most ancient time periods into the most recent time periods. Notably, the same top haplotype remained at high frequency across time at 9 of these 14 sweeps.
