The National Institutes of Health in the United States, for example, employs scientists to perform research at its own laboratories (intramural research), and it also awards grants to pay for research at external institutions such as universities (extramural research). Here, using data from 1594 intramural grants and 97054 extramural grants funded between 2009 and 2019 , we compare the scholarly outputs from these two funding mechanisms in terms of number of publications, relative citation ratio and clinical metrics. We find that extramural awards more cost-effectively fund outputs commonly used for academic review such as number of publications and citations per dollar, while intramural awards are more cost-effective at generating work that influences future clinical work, more closely in line with agency health goals. These findings provide evidence that institutional incentives associated with different funding mechanisms drive their comparative strengths.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Here, by analysing 95 tissue samples from 26 deceased transplant organ donors we show that, despite representing less than 5% of circulating Tregs, CD8+ Tregs are enriched in human tissue, particularly in non-lymphoid tissues and bone marrow. We further show that they are fully demethylated at the FOXP3 TSDR, indicating lineage stability, and demonstrate their presence in human thymic tissue and cord blood. Transcriptomic profiling revealed strong similarities to CD4+ Tregs, however at the protein level, they reside in tissue as surface CD25lo/- CD8+CD69+CD103+TLR9+HELIOS+FOXP3+ cells, expressing CD25 intracellularly. Surface CD25 was rapidly regained ex-vivo, allowing us to sort and expand them, and to subsequently demonstrate their therapeutic potential in a humanised mouse model of graft-vs-host disease. Additionally we report increased circulating CD8+Tregs in individuals with SLE and patients early following traumatic brain injury (TBI), underscoring their functional importance. We conclude that these under-studied cells likely play an essential but previously unappreciated role in maintaining peripheral tolerance.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

While much research has focused on prediction errors elicited by violations of single sensory features, natural environments frequently present more complex events deviating across multiple stimulus dimensions and sensory modalities. In this study, we employed a hierarchical oddball paradigm (n=30) manipulating auditory and somatosensory stimuli to violate one or two sensory features while high-density EEG was recorded. Temporal decoding revealed that while both single- and double-deviants evoked sustained supramodal activation patterns, double-deviants uniquely elicited a supramodal response starting at 100 ms after the oddball. Effective connectivity analyses identified shared interhemispheric interactions between inferior frontal gyri across modalities, as well as distinct modality-specific connectivity within early and associative sensory cortices. Our findings demonstrate that multi-feature prediction errors recruit both rapid supramodal integration mechanisms and hierarchically organized modality-specific pathways. These results advance our understanding of how the brain flexibly integrates multiple sensory expectation violations across different levels of cortical processing, providing new insights into the neural architecture supporting predictive perception.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Pam3CSK4 (a synthetic triacylated lipopeptide), and R848 (an imidazoquinoline analog of viral nucleic acids). Population structure and ancestry were characterized, and transcriptome-wide differential expression analyses were performed. Results We identified 30 genes with significant altitude-associated expression differences, including 22 downregulated (e.g., FN1, CD36, FOS) and nine upregulated genes.

We looked at the abundance of microplastics and microfibers from textiles and other sources in this dynamic environment. Our primary interest was assessing how microfibers in a textile-rich environment contribute to overall microplastic pollution. Continuous monitoring of air quality using PurpleAir sensors showed large concentrations of airborne microparticles around the market, which were shown to drop with rain events. Water collected from rain contained dozens to hundreds of microfibers and microplastics (roughly in a 1:10 ratio), depending on the intensity of the rain and on whether the rain was preceded by a significant period of dry weather. Microfiber and microplastic counts from airborne samples showed concentrations about >20x to >100x greater, respectively, than those reported from other metropolises around the world. A comparison of concentrations from water in the adjacent Korle Lagoon was similarly striking, with up to 45x more microfibers, and up to 200x more microplastics than what has previously been reported for lagoon waters worldwide. Beyond the microscale, the issue of whole garments as waste was also demonstrated, with a strong similarity found between the global brand garment tags from fashion items discarded in the market and those that were washed up on nearby beaches, highlighting the need for more holistic regulatory frameworks to address textile waste.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Prior research has shown that people have stable preferences regarding such decisions and maintain rich, nuanced mental representations of their close social partners. Yet, if and how such mental representations shape social decisions preferences remains to be seen. Using a combination of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and natural language processing (NLP), this study investigated how neural and linguistic representations of close others relate to social decision-making. After nominating a parent and friend, male and female participants (N = 63) rated their characteristics and made hypothetical social decisions while undergoing fMRI. Neural representations of parents and friends, relative to the self, were linked to social decision preferences. Specifically, greater neural similarity between self and parent in the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and nucleus accumbens (NAcc) was associated with a preference for parents, while greater self-friend similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was associated with friend-preference. Additionally, linguistic analysis of written descriptions of close others from a separate sample of males and females (N = 1,641) revealed that social decision preferences could be reliably predicted from semantic features of the text. High correspondence between neural and linguistic data in the imaging sample further strengthened the association with social decision preferences. These findings help elucidate the neural and linguistic underpinnings of social decision-making, emphasizing the critical role of mental representations in guiding choices involving familiar others.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Identification of FG-NUPs at PD is consistent with the recruitment of NUPs to form a PD pore gating complex consistent with phase separation domains as diffusion barriers at PD.

The Escherichia coli genome encodes at least 150 small proteins, most of which are functionally uncharacterized. We identified and characterized 17 small proteins induced in E. coli during magnesium (Mg2+) starvation using ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and transcriptional reporter assays. Several of these were transcriptionally activated by the PhoQ-PhoP two-component signaling system, which is crucial for Mg2+ homeostasis. Deletion or overexpression of some of these small proteins led to growth defects and changes in cell size under low-Mg2+ conditions, indicating physiological roles in stress adaptation. The small transmembrane protein YoaI, which was transcriptionally induced by the phosphate-responsive PhoR-PhoB signaling pathway, increased in abundance under Mg2+ limitation independently of yoaI transcription or PhoQ-PhoP signaling. YoaI activated a third signaling system, EnvZ-OmpR, which mediates responses to osmotic stress. Overall, this study establishes an initial framework for understanding how small proteins contribute to bacterial stress adaptation by facilitating cross-talk between different signaling systems. Our results suggest these proteins play broader roles in coordinating stress responses, reflecting the interconnected nature of cellular stress networks rather than strictly compartmentalized pathways responding to specific stressors.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

R.; Lynch, T.; Erickson McNally, B. J.; Losic, T.; Lundquist, J.", "abstract": "The central components of the ABA core signaling pathway are families of receptors, clade A type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), SNF1-Related Protein Kinases (SnRK2s), and diverse sets of proteins regulated by phosphorylation via these kinases, including bZIP transcription factors such as ABA-INSENSITIVE(ABI)5. The larger network of ABA signaling factors includes additional kinases and E3 ligases that modify these components to affect their activity and stability. The ABI5-Binding Proteins (AFPs) are negative regulators of ABA response. This study shows that the AFPs interact with specific family members of all components of this pathway and are substrates for SnRK2s and PP2Cs. AFPs also interact with subsets of MAP kinases (MPKs) and 14-3-3 proteins previously found to regulate activity of the ABI5-related clade of transcription factors. Residues predicted to be phosphorylated are conserved between AFPs, but are located within regions predicted to be unstructured. ABA promotes phosphorylation of AFP2, but conditions that prevent phosphorylation of AFP2 result in decreased stability, a shift in localization toward dispersed foci, and reduced effectiveness for inhibiting ABA response at germination. Thus, AFP2 appears to be an important hub in the ABA core signaling pathway.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Despite intensive chemo- and radiotherapy, only 40% of patients survive, and they often suffer from severe long-term side effects of these genotoxic treatments. Thus, new therapies are needed that are less toxic and more efficacious. Here, we identified diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) as a tool compound that preferentially targets MNA neuroblastoma. Using proteomic assays we investigated the DPI mode of action, finding that DPI induces the proteasomal degradation of MYCN and could reverse some alterations induced by high levels of MYCN. These include profound changes in the expression of proteins participating in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Metabolic and biological assays suggested that alterations in mitochondrial function and the associated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are critical DPI targets in the context of MNA. DPI reduced the survival, and malignant transformation of neuroblastoma across a panel of cell lines at clinically achievable concentrations. DPI also shrank tumors and prevented metastatic spread in zebrafish models of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma. These findings suggest that processes impacted by complex I inhibitors could be valuable new targets for the development of non-genotoxic drugs against high-risk MNA neuroblastoma.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

To test the hypothesis that intergenerational transmission of a perturbed small intestinal microbiota contributes to undernutrition by inducing EED, we characterized two consortia of bacterial strains cultured from duodenal aspirates from stunted Bangladeshi children with EED - one of which induced local and systemic inflammation in female gnotobiotic mice. Offspring of dams colonized with the inflammatory consortium exhibited impaired prenatal and postnatal growth, as well as immunologic changes phenocopying features of EED in children. Dam-to-pup transmission of the inflammatory consortium produced, in recently weaned offspring, alterations in (i) inter-cellular signaling pathways related to intestinal epithelial cell renewal, barrier integrity and immune function plus (ii) glial- and endothelial-neuronal signaling pathways that regulate neural growth, angiogenesis and inflammation in the cerebral cortex. Cohousing of mice harboring the inflammatory or non-inflammatory consortia and subsequent screening of candidate disease-promoting bacterial isolates identified Campylobacter concisus, an organism typically found in the oral microbiota, as a contributor to enteropathy. The C. concisus strain induced, in a host nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-dependent manner, pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling.

Healthy participants (n=26; mean age 28{+/-}5 years, 14F) wore a near-corneal plane light logger for one week and reported non-wear events in three ways: pressing an \"event marker\" button on the light logger, placing it in a black bag, and using an app-based Wear log. Wear log entries, checked twice daily, served as ground truth for non-wear detection, showing that non-wear time constituted 5.4{+/-}3.8% (mean{+/-}SD) of total participation time. Button presses at the start and end of non-wear intervals were identified in >85.4% of cases when considering time windows beyond one minute for detection. To detect non-wear intervals based on black bag use and lack of motion, we employed an algorithm detecting clusters of low illuminance and clusters of low activity. Performance was higher for illuminance (F1=0.78) than activity (F1=0.52). Light exposure metrics derived from the full dataset, a dataset filtered for non-wear based on self-reports, and a dataset filtered for non-wear using the low illuminance clusters detection algorithm showed minimal differences.

In this study, we conducted a systematic analysis of 2,053 gut metagenomes from 14 globally-sampled public cohorts and a newly recruited cohort. Despite substantial regional and cohort-level heterogeneity in microbiome composition, we elucidated that the consistent dynamic patterns of microbial signatures are the fundamental for CRC detection. These patterns enabled robust performance in both inter-cohort and independent validations using an optimized bioinformatics framework. In contrast, such basis was lacking in ADA-associated microbial markers, limiting the generalizability of early detection models.

While electroencephalography (EEG) has been widely used to study such processes, examining these slower aspects during social interaction presents unique methodological challenges. Here we address this issue by investigating infra-slow EEG, respiratory, and electrodermal signals recorded simultaneously during a perceptual crossing experiment (PCE)-a recently established paradigm in social cognition and EEG hyperscanning. Through innovative spectral characterization methods and a novel dyadic regression approach, we establish a methodological framework for examining infra-slow dynamics that coordinate brain and body during social interaction. Our analysis revealed that, when time-locked to task responses, the spectral power of infra-slow oscillations (ISOs) at 0.05 Hz and 0.1 Hz showed enhanced inter-participant similarity in dyads achieving mutual recognition relative to those that did not. Although not strictly simultaneous, this inter-personal alignment in the spectral power of ISOs was accompanied by concurrent dynamics both in respiratory pressure and electrodermal activity, suggesting that ISOs reflect the integration of autonomic, cognitive, and social processes, with their alignment facilitating shared understanding and joint action. Crucially, we find that task-responses in participants who successfully engaged in the PCE task were coupled to the phase of the 0.1 Hz rhythm. Additionally, we show that ISOs and aperiodic activity tracked behaviorally relevant transitions, notably prior to and during the perceptual crossing task. Taken together, our findings highlight an important role for ISOs in mediating the temporal dynamics of social cognition and show that inter-participant alignment in ISOs and physiological signals can serve as a proxy for the complex interplay between body physiology, cognition, and social behavior.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

While its DNA cleavage and target recognition mechanisms have been studied extensively, the possibility of auxiliary enzymatic functions remains underexplored. Here, I report that Acidaminococcus sp. Cas12a (AsCas12a) possesses intrinsic ATPase activity, despite lacking canonical nucleotide-binding or hydrolysis motifs. Using a radiometric thin-layer chromatography (TLC) assay, I demonstrate that AsCas12a hydrolyzes ATP in a concentration and time- dependent manner. Importantly, this activity occurs independently of DNA cofactors, as neither single-stranded nor double-stranded DNA could influence the rate or extent of ATP hydrolysis. Bioinformatic analyses using NsitePred and SwissDock, as well as ATPbind, suggests potential ATP-binding residues with predicted favorable binding energies. This preliminary finding uncovers a previously unrecognized biochemical property of AsCas12a.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

M.; Targovnik, H. M.", "abstract": "This study provides an extensive bioinformatics evaluation of the origin and structural complexity of thyroglobulin (TG). We investigate the structural and evolutionary conservation of TG in Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey) by reconstructing its complete TG sequence and comparing it to human TG. Using genomic data from NCBI, Uniprot, and Ensembl, we assembled a 2831amino acid sequence (TGPM), identifying key TG modules, including 11 TG type 1 modules, three TG type 2 modules, five TG type 3 modules, as well as the linker, hinge, and ChEL domains. Sequence alignment with human TG revealed strong conservation of hormonogenic tyrosines and cysteine residues, underscoring their structural significance in both species. We generated a PDB model for TGPM using the Swiss Model program for homology modeling. The full length sea lamprey TG was subsequently aligned with full length human TG through the Matchmaker command in UCSF ChimeraX, revealing a consistent structural overlap across all four regions (I, II, III, IV), highlighting their evolutionary conservation. Additionally, we identified a second sea lamprey TG transcript, TGPM1746, which begins with the TG type 1 10 module and extends to the carboxyl terminus, exhibiting high homology with TGPM except in region III. We also present an evolutionary model proposing that nidogen, a protein containing TG type 1 modules, may have been the precursor to TG. Through genetic rearrangements and duplication events, a proto TG likely emerged, influenced by environmental factors such as ionizing radiation. Structural modifications led to the loss of nidogens globular regions, resulting in a secretory proto-TG containing three TG type 1 modules. Successive duplications expanded the TG structure, ultimately forming TG 11 type 1 modules, closely resembling the ancestral TG in Petromyzon marinus. The final evolutionary phase involved the incorporation of TG type 3 and TG type 2 modules, followed by the fusion of the ChEL domain, which enhanced TG secretion and thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Our findings confirm that the TG complexation process is fully established in lampreys and has remained virtually unchanged throughout vertebrate evolution.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Although important in studying vision quality, it has been overlooked in research on binocular and oculomotor vision. This study presents the construction of ocular torsion in the binocular system that incorporates the fovea displaced from the posterior pole and the lens tilted away from the eyes optical axis. When the eyes binocular posture changes, each eyes torsional position transformations, computed in the framework of Rodrigues vector, are visualized in GeoGebra simulations. Listings law, important in oculomotor control by constraining a single eye redundant torsional degree of freedom, is ab initio formulated for bifoveal fixations in the binocular system with misaligned optical components for the fixed upright head. It leads to the configuration space of binocularly constrained eyes rotations, including the noncommutativity rule. This formulation modifies the Listing plane of the straight-ahead eyes primary position by replacing it with the binocular eyes posture corresponding to the empirical horopters abathic distance fixation, a unique bifoveal fixation for which the longitudinal horopter is a straight frontal line. Notably, it corresponds to the eye muscles natural tonus resting position, which serves as a zero-reference level for convergence effort. Supported by ophthalmology studies, it revises the elusive neurophysiological significance of the Listing plane. Furthermore, the binocular constraints couple 3D changes in the eyes orientation and, hence, torsional positions during simulations with GeoGebras dynamic geometry. The binocular Listings law developed here can support this coupling, which is important in oculomotor control. The results obtained in this study should be a part of the answers to the questions posted in the literature on the relevance of Listings law to clinical practices.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

V.; Rajmani, R. S.; Chakravortty, D.", "abstract": "The cooperative response through AI-2 allows Salmonella to coordinate and regulate its community behaviours crucial for its survival and infection. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for developing strategies to interfere with Salmonella's ability to cause disease. In this study, we report that Salmonella Typhimurium uses AI-2 signaling to modulate the expression of chemotaxis and motility-associated genes and the formation of flagella on the bacterial cell surface. The AI-2 acts as a chemoattractant, and the cascade mediates the chemotactic response of Salmonella. Such regulations assist in the attachment and invasion of Salmonella into intestinal epithelial cells both in vitro and in a murine model. Furthermore, we determined that HilD, known to regulate motility by induction of a chemoreceptor and SPI-1 in Salmonella, along with key SPI-1 genes, is underexpressed in the absence of LuxS/AI-2 signaling, which unravels a complex regulatory network by AI-2 in Salmonella. Beyond the initial phase, this signaling facilitates survival in the presence of polymyxin B and supports intracellular survival and persistence within epithelial cells by regulating the pmrD/AB system, thereby evading the antimicrobial peptide immune response. Additionally, our findings show that Salmonella activates its LuxS/AI-2 signalling cascade within the Caco-2 epithelial cells. Complementary observation through transcriptomic profiling revealed that LuxS/AI-2 signalling governs the coordinated regulation of genes implicated in distinct phases of Salmonella pathogenesis. Lastly using a mouse model, we show that AI-2 signaling is critical for organ colonization and virulence of Salmonella, and inhibition of LuxS/AI-2 signaling in combination with antibiotics can be an alternative therapeutic approach. Thus, our study dissects an integrated regulatory mechanism by which AI-2 signaling mediates critical processes during multiple stages of Salmonella Typhimurium pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Phyling efficiently resolves large phylogenies by optimizing memory usage and data processing. Its checkpoint system enables users to incrementally add or remove samples without repeating the entire search process.

I.", "abstract": "Background: Atherosclerotic lesions comprise different populations of macrophages, including lipid-laden macrophage foam cells and non-foamy, inflammatory macrophages, playing different roles in disease progression. Previous studies demonstrated higher expression of inflammarafts - enlarged, cholesterol-rich lipid rafts hosting assemblies of inflammatory receptors - in non-foamy, inflammatory macrophages, as opposed to lower inflammarafts in lipid-lade macrophage foam cells. Apolipoprotein A-I Binding Protein (AIBP) facilitates cholesterol efflux from macrophages and has been shown to reduce inflammatory responses and protect against atherosclerosis. This study investigated the effect of AIBP deficiency on inflammaraft expression in aortic foam cells and non-foamy macrophages in hypercholesterolemic mice. Methods: Single-cell suspensions were prepared from aortae of Apoa1bp-/-Ldlr-/- and Ldlr-/- male and female mice fed a high-cholesterol, high-fat diet. CD45+ F4/80+ macrophages were gated for BODIPY-high foamy and BODIPY-low non-foamy cells and analyzed for the expression of inflammaraft markers TLR4 (toll-like receptor-4) dimers and lipid rafts. Consecutive sections of the aortic root were stained with modified Van Gieson stain to assess lesion and necrotic core sizes. Results: Foam cells constituted a higher percentage of macrophages and contained more neutral lipid in Apoa1bp-/-Ldlr-/- compared to Ldlr-/- aorta. Importantly, in AIBP-deficient mice, foam cells expressed higher levels of TLR4 dimers and lipid rafts than in control mice, while non-foamy cells expressed similar levels. Apoa1bp-/-Ldlr-/- mice had larger atherosclerotic lesions and necrotic cores compared to Ldlr-/- mice. Male and female mice showed similar results. Conclusions: Our results indicate that AIBP deficiency leads to the formation of a new foam cell phenotype in which the increased lipid accumulation is associated with an increased expression of TLR4 inflammarafts. This transition of foam cells to a proinflammatory phenotype correlates with the development of advanced atherosclerotic plaques.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Data was collected from a cross-sectional survey of 144 veterinary and para-veterinary professionals (n=144) using an online structured self-administered questionnaire in ZOHO software. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and logistic regression in IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25. The findings revealed a high foundational knowledge of AMR, with 66.7% correctly defining AMR. The majority of respondents (82%) acknowledged that overuse of antimicrobials reduces their effectiveness and expressed strong support for mitigation efforts, with 95.8% endorsing farmer education as a key strategy. However, significant gaps in practice persisted: 75% of animal owners frequently initiated antibiotic use without supervision; professionals largely relied on empirical treatment (62.5%); and only 20.8% of professionals routinely performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), due to barriers like cost and laboratory accessibility. Logistic regression analysis revealed no significant associations between socio-demographic variables and levels of AMR knowledge or attitudes. This suggests that barriers to responsible antimicrobial use may be more structural than individual. We conclude that while Zambian practicing veterinary and para-veterinary professionals possess strong AMR awareness and positive attitudes, risky practices do persist.

However, standardized image databases often lack fine-grained ratings of social dimensions beyond basic emotional content. We present a normative dataset of 296 affective scenes rated by 424 adult participants across six social-affective dimensions: social relevance, emotion sharing, action sharing, interpersonal equality, scene pleasantness, and participatory arousal. Each image was independently coded for objective features such as number of people, face visibility, and gaze direction. All rating dimensions showed excellent interrater reliability. Pleasantness ratings demonstrated strong convergent validity with established valence norms from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS), while arousal ratings differentiated between experienced and participatory arousal, suggesting that the latter captures a distinct affective component. Correlation analyses revealed that social relevance was strongly predicted by scene pleasantness and a composite \"engagement\" factor combining emotion sharing, action sharing, and equality. Notably, the association between pleasantness and social relevance was especially pronounced in scenes depicting single individuals. Linear mixed models further indicated that extraversion modestly amplified the relationship between engagement and social relevance, while other personality traits and empathy did not significantly affect ratings. This open-access dataset provides a reliable, multidimensional tool for selecting affective scenes based on both emotional and social-interpersonal features.

R.; Chung, R.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a terminal neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss resulting from the buildup of amyloid-beta plaques and tau protein tangles. Lithium salts, particularly lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), inhibit the enzyme Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3, which is upregulated in AD, reducing tau and amyloid-beta accumulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. However, Li2CO3 has declined in use due to long-term neurotoxicity. Lithium orotate (LiOr), an alternative lithium salt, has greater bioavailability--delivering more ions to the brain--but was discontinued in the 1970s due to toxicity concerns at equivalent doses. It was hypothesized that LiOr would be more effective than Li2CO3 at lower doses (5 mM) due to higher lithium ion transfer, while Li2CO3 may outperform LiOr at higher doses (10 mM) due to LiOr's toxicity. This study compares LiOr and Li2CO3 in treating locomotion and memory in a Drosophila melanogaster model produced by crossing UAS amyloid-beta 42 and Act5c GAL4 flies via the GAL4/UAS system. Once aged to 25 days, flies were assessed for locomotion using the negative geotaxis assay and for short-term memory using the aversive phototaxic suppression (APS) assay. These behavioral assays aim to quantify changes in cognitive and motor function resulting from treatment.

Using neuromelanin-sensitive ultra-high field (7T) MRI, we previously identified a reduction in neuromelanin signal in the caudal LC, indicating a rostro-caudal gradient of noradrenergic cell loss. Caudal LC degeneration was associated with greater severity of non-motor symptoms such as orthostatic hypotension and apathy. In the current study, we expanded the PD cohort to further validate the structure-symptom relationships within the LC and investigate how degeneration along the rostro-caudal LC axis affects arousal-related functional responsivity. To this end, 71 people with PD in the ON-medication state and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent clinical assessments and 7T magnetization transfer-weighted (MTw) MRI to quantify structural changes along the rostro-caudal LC axis. A subgroup of 30 people with PD and 27 controls underwent 7T fMRI to assess LC responsivity to arousing auditory and visual stimuli in two fMRI sessions on separate days. Healthy controls were scanned twice without medication, while people with PD were studied on and off dopaminergic medication in counterbalanced order. In the PD group, MTw MRI confirmed a significant reduction of the regional neuromelanin signal in caudal LC relative to the control group (P = 0.0099). This structural disintegration correlated with orthostatic hypotension (P = 0.0087) and cognitive impairment (P = 0.036), corroborating its clinical relevance. Functional MRI revealed reduced activation of the caudal LC to arousing visual and auditory stimuli in people with PD relative to controls (P = 0.012). This difference reached statistical significance only in the ON-medication state, with a similar but non-significant trend in the OFF-medication state (P = 0.10). In an exploratory analysis of a smaller sub-sample, structural and functional caudal LC signals were significantly correlated in both people with PD and healthy controls (P = 0.0069). Together, the findings provide evidence for a rostro-caudal gradient of LC pathology in PD at both structural and functional levels. While structural MRI provides fine-grained insights into spatial gradients of disease-related pathology, functional MRI captures impaired functional responsivity of caudal LC. The presence of arousal-induced hypoactivation of caudal LC in the ON-medication state indicates that LC dysfunction extends beyond dopamine deficits in PD, highlighting complex interactions between dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

However, the extent to which disease progression and antiparkinsonian therapies contribute to this systemic dysregulation remains unclear. To address these issues, in the present study we measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography the concentrations of glutamatergic system-related D- and L-amino acids and their precursors in the plasma of male and female healthy controls (HC) and PD patients across three distinct clinical stages and treatment conditions: (1) early stage L-DOPA naive patients treated with MAO-B inhibitors; (2) mid-stage patients treated with L-DOPA; and (3) advanced stage patients receiving Deep Brain Stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) plus L-DOPA. Our results reveal notable reduction of circulating neuroactive D- and L-amino acids exclusively in male PD patients, while female patients remain unaffected regardless of disease stage or treatment. In male patients, this dysregulation manifests early, with L-DOPA-naive individuals showing decreased plasma levels of L-glutamate and L-aspartate. In mid stage L-DOPA-treated PD patients, amino acid reductions extend to L-alanine, L-serine, L-glutamine, L-asparagine, and L-threonine. Remarkably, in advanced PD patients, with a median disease duration of ~23 years, STN-DBS normalizes the blood concentrations of these amino acids to those observed in HC. In conclusion, our study highlights the potential of circulating D- and L-amino acid dysregulation as an early biomarker of PD and demonstrates that, in contrast to L-DOPA therapy, the STN-DBS confers systemic metabolic benefits even at advanced stages of the disease.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

We developed a dual behavioral paradigm integrating an olfactory discrimination Y-maze and an escape learning task requiring crickets to override innate odor preferences. Adult, mid-age, and geriatric crickets were tested for sensory discrimination, associative learning, and decision speed. Morphological traits, including antennal and femoral metrics, were quantified to evaluate their influence on cognitive outcomes. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, ANCOVA, and logistic regression models. Aging impaired olfactory preference and learning success, with geriatric crickets showing reduced task acquisition and memory retention. Mid-age individuals exhibited the slowest decision-making, suggesting an early onset shift in behavioral strategy. Morphological traits predicted aspects of sensory performance and physiological resilience, such as reduced weight loss in crickets with larger femoral dimensions but did not explain age-related cognitive deficits. Olfactory decline was particularly pronounced in males, mirroring sex differences observed in human cognitive aging. House crickets exhibit hallmark features of cognitive aging, including sensory decline, learning impairments, and reduced resilience, independent of morphological deterioration.

M.", "abstract": "Background: Machine learning models trained on paratope-similarity networks have shown superior accuracy compared with clonotype-based models in binary disease classification. However, the computational demands of paratope networks hinder their use on large datasets and multi-disease classification. Methods: We reanalyzed publicly available T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data from 1,421 donors across 15 disease groups and a large control group, encompassing approximately 81 million TCR sequences. To address computational bottlenecks, we replaced the paratope-similarity network approach (Paratope Cluster Occupancy or PCO) with a new pipeline Fast Approximate Clustering Techniques (FACTS) which comprises of four main steps: (1) high-dimensional vector encoding of sequences; (2) efficient clustering of vectors; (3) donor-level feature construction from cluster distributions; and (4) gradient-boosted decision tree classification for multi-class disease prediction. Findings: FACTS processed 10 sequences in under 120 CPU hours. Using only TCR data, and evaluated with 3-fold cross-validation, it achieved a mean ROC AUC of 0.99 across 16 disease classes. Compared with the recently reported Mal-ID model, FACTS achieved higher donor-level classification accuracy for BCR (0.840 vs. 0.740), TCR (0.862 vs. 0.751), and combined BCR+TCR datasets (0.898 vs. 0.853). FACTS also preserved biologically meaningful signals, as shown by unsupervised t-SNE projections revealing distinct disease-associated and age-associated clusters. Interpretation: Paratope-based encoding with FACTS-derived features provides a scalable and biologically grounded approach for adaptive immune receptor (AIR) repertoire classification. The resulting classifier achieves superior multi-disease diagnostic performance while maintaining interpretability, supporting its potential for clinical and population-scale health profiling.

Here we show that plasma cells are the most negatively affected by adenosine among the immune cells present in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, both tonsillar and tumor-associated B cells, including germinal center (GC)-like B cells, plasma cells and plasma blasts (PCs and PBs, respectively, and collectively referred to as antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), express high levels of A2AR. Given the importance of tumor-infiltrating B and PCs in antitumor responses, we investigated how adenosine impairs their numbers and function. Triggering of A2AR inhibited B cell maturation into ASCs and immunoglobulin production in vitro, and impaired upregulation of PC genes upon stimulation. These effects were restored by inupadenant (EOS100850), a potent and highly selective small molecule A2AR antagonist. Spatial transcriptomics analysis of tumor biopsies from patients treated with inupadenant revealed that ASCs specifically increased in tertiary lymphoid structures. Altogether, these data demonstrate that A2AR plays a key role in adenosine-mediated inhibition of B cell maturation toward ASCs through a B cell-intrinsic mechanism, and that this effect is fully reverted by inupadenant.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Kinetic analyses reveal that while linear enhancer-promoter distance moderately tunes transcriptional output, downstream enhancer positioning reduces mRNA output by 70%. Each configuration modulates distinct transcriptional parameters: linear distance governs initiation kinetics, while relative enhancer positioning dictates transcriptional stability. These effects are consistent across varied enhancer and reporter sequences, revealing configuration-dependent cis-regulatory element arrangement as an intrinsic mechanism for transcriptional fine-tuning.

However, the mechanisms for this critical quality control pathway remain poorly understood. Here we identify LENG8 as a conserved RNA nuclear retention factor. We showed that LENG8 is recruited to pre-mRNAs by splicing factors, including the U1 snRNP. LENG8 binds to PCID2 and SEM1 to form the REX (Repressor of EXport) complex, which is conserved from yeast to human, and causes RNA nuclear retention by acting as a dominant negative factor for the essential mRNA export factor TREX-2. LENG8 depletion leads to the leakage of misprocessed mRNAs, including intronically polyadenylated and intron-retained mRNAs, as well as noncoding RNAs into the cytoplasm. Finally, LENG8 promotes RNA degradation by recruiting PAXT and the RNA exosome. Thus our study revealed a conserved quality control mechanism for eukaryotic gene expression that ensures only fully and correctly processed RNAs are exported from the nucleus.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

How GPR99/OXGR1 recognizes two distinct ligands is a biologically important question relevant to therapeutic development due to its established roles in asthma, allergy and inflammation. Here we present cryo-EM structures of GPR99/OXGR1-Gq complex with oxoglutarate and LTE4, respectively. The oxoglutarate-bound structure shows a binding pocket surrounded by the transmembrane domains (TM), with a primary site and an accessory site for simultaneous binding of two oxoglutarate molecules for full activation of the receptor. The TM binding pocket, however, is too small to accommodate the \"Y\" shaped structure of LTE4, a cysteinyl leukotriene. Alanine substitution of key residues for oxoglutarate binding had little impact on LTE4-induced signaling. An alternative site in between TM3/4/5 just above intracellular loop 2 was identified in the cryo-EM structure of GPR99/OXGR1-Gq complex formed with LTE4, but the densities were less well defined. Alanine substitution of amino acids potentially involved in LTE4 interaction at this site abrogated LTE4-induced receptor activation, with no effect on oxoglutarate-induced signaling. Both ligands activated GPR99/OXGR1 primarily through the Gq pathway, but LTE4 also induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation that was sensitive to pertussis toxin. These findings illustrate the structural basis for GPR99/OXGR1 interaction with oxoglutarate and suggest the presence of a distinct binding site for LTE4.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Preliminary analyses of JCM 1772 and JCM 35779, conducted using adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis, revealed notable differences between the two strains. JCM 1772 showed a capacity for adaptive evolution, leading to the emergence of mutants with increased HA production. In contrast, EMS was found to be toxic to JCM 35779 and was less effective in yielding mutants. Notwithstanding, JCM 35779 demonstrates a significant enhancement over JCM 1772 and its mutants, achieving up to 4.7 to 2.8-fold improvement in HA production while generally exhibiting lower BA production. Genomic analysis of these strains revealed the absence of a BA-specific CoA transferase in JCM 35779, which may explain its metabolic preference for HA over BA synthesis. This hypothesis was further supported by perturbation experiments involving acetate supplementation. These findings highlight the connections between genomic variation, metabolic pathways, and environmental perturbations in shaping MCFA output.

For example, in magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), short-echo time (TE) sequences are frequently employed to estimate difficult-to-measure metabolites such as GABA, despite J-difference editing being the recommended gold-standard for improved metabolic specificity. This work investigates the critical relationship between the correlation of proxy and gold-standard measurements and the associated false positive (FPR) and false negative (FNR) rates of statistical tests performed on proxy measurements. Through statistical simulations, we demonstrate that even moderately high correlations (0.6-0.7), reported in the literature for short-TE vs. J-edited estimated GABA, can lead to drastically inflated FPRs and FNRs. We show that these rates are highly sensitive to the magnitude of any introduced bias in the proxy measurement ({delta}) and the underlying true effect size ({Delta}). For instance, a small, unmeasured bias in short-TE estimated GABA, potentially arising from macromolecule contamination, can substantially inflate FPRs. Conversely, imperfect correlation can significantly reduce statistical power, leading to high FNRs, which may explain some discrepancies within the literature. Although this work focuses specifically on the relationship between short-TE and MEGA-edited GABA, the arguments presented here apply more broadly to other difficult-to-measure metabolites in MRS (e.g., glutathione, 2-hydroxyglutarate), or generally to any circumstance where statistical tests are performed on the readily available proxy measurements in place of gold-standard measurements.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly understood. By generating new in vitro and in vivo models of aneuploidy, we found that aneuploidy confers remarkable resistance to reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cell death. This is a general consequence of aneuploidy, independent of the specific chromosomes gained or lost. Mechanistically, aneuploidy-induced resistance to cell death results from suppressed Poly(ADP-Ribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP1) in aneuploid cells, which inhibits PARP1-mediated cell death after ROS (parthanatos). We validated aneuploidy-associated PARP1 suppression across 15 cell models and human tumors, with pronounced effects in metastatic tumors. Importantly, decreased PARP1 levels in aneuploid cells promote tumor metastasis and vice versa. Through genome-wide CRISPR screen, a focused CRISPRa screen and functional validation, we identified the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPB) as a critical mediator of PARP1 downregulation and ROS resistance in aneuploid cells. Furthermore, we found lysosomal dysfunction as the upstream mediator of CEBPB activation in aneuploid cells. We propose that during tumorigenesis, aneuploidy-driven CEBPB activation promotes PARP1 suppression fostering ROS resistance and cancer progression.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Biased agonists that activate G protein or {beta}-arrestin pathways provide promising therapeutic potential, but the molecular determinants for this signaling bias and its physiological implications remain poorly understood. This study profiles AngII analogs with modifications at the C-terminal Phe8, revealing that analogs 11, 12, and 29a exhibit varying degrees of Gq engagement while maintaining potent {beta}-arrestin recruitment. Notably, 12 enhances left ventricular ejection fraction with minimal pressor responses in normotensive rats, while other analogs with variable Gq activity do not promote inotropy. Molecular modeling indicates that the unique profile of 12 results from its flexible long side chain engaging a deep allosteric pocket within AT1R. This study demonstrates that engineering AngII's C-terminus enables selective tuning of AT1R signaling to control arterial versus cardiac responses, providing strategies for developing improved cardiovascular therapeutics.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Ischemic stroke triggers rapid and complex molecular changes, yet the dynamics of mRNA translation during stroke remain largely unexplored. Here, we present the first temporal ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) analysis in a murine distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) model, assessing translational regulation at 1-, 6-, and 24-hours post-stroke. We identified distinct stage-specific phenomena, including a hyperacute GC-ending codon bias and a transient burst of stop-codon readthrough (SCRT) at 1-hour, predominantly affecting neuronal and synaptic pathways, and an activation of pathways linked to vascular remodeling and endothelial function. From 6-hours onward, we observed progressive ribosome pausing, altered elongation dynamics, and widespread frameshifting affecting mitochondrial, synaptic, and metabolic genes, coinciding with strong immune pathway activation. These events cannot be evaluated at the level of transcript abundance, underscoring the value of translation-focused approaches. Our findings reveal that translational control in stroke follows a phased program, with multiple regulatory and maladaptive phenomena impacting the gene expression and outcome of stroke.

Fine-scale vegetation surveys were used to assess how wetland plant communities vary across sites with historical RVF outbreaks in Free State Province of South Africa and to detail plant species density that correlates with mosquito habitat. Methods: At 22 sites, we compiled 201 releves using the modified Braun-Blanquet method in combination with 200 transects using the line-point method developed specifically for this study. A total of 195 plants were identified and vouchered. These data were combined with soil analyses carried out at all 22 sites and with data from bimonthly mosquito trapping at all sites. Results and significance: We identified an increase of invasive plants and upland species compared to the earlier study and observed that drought causes a change in wetland vegetation community structure and species composition. However, the wetland vegetation was still dominated by grasses and sedges, with a limited presence of Juncus and forbs. Livestock grazing pressure on wetlands to the drought results in reduced vegetation cover, abundance and diversity.

Genetic lines of least resistance, and by proxy morphological variance, are known to limit adaptive divergence, but ecological variance is rarely investigated. Here we test whether ecological or morphological lines of least resistance in generalist populations may have constrained the directions of species divergence in two independent Caribbean adaptive radiations of Cyprinodon pupfishes. We find almost universal congruence between the major multivariate dimensions of intraspecific craniofacial and dietary variance within generalist populations and the major axes of interspecific divergence within each adaptive radiation. This is surprising given that we document unique trophic specialists within each radiation, including a bivalve-specialist, zooplanktivore, molluscivore/ostracod-specialist, and scale-eating specialist, while nearly all generalist populations were observed to feed rarely on these same resources. We conclude that pre-existing genetic constraints within each founding generalist population, resulting in dimensions of greater ecological and morphological variance, may partially constrain and predict the directions of species divergence and dietary specialization during adaptive radiation. We also provide a new framework for examining ecological lines of least resistance.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

Several methods have been developed for the prediction of segregation variance, including correlation with genotypic diversity, progeny simulations, or algebraic derivations in case of a diploid inheritance. To the best of our knowledge, no algebraic derivation using parental genotypic information is available to predict segregation variance for autotetraploid species. The objectives of our study were to (1) derive algebraic derivation based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) between linked loci to predict the segregation variance in autotetraploid species; (2) compare the performance of segregation variance estimated based on simulated progenies and the algebraic derivation; (3) investigate by simulations how experimental parameters affect the accuracy of segregation variance prediction; and (4) compare the segregation variance estimated in empirical data of potato and the one based on the algebraic derivation. The segregation variance estimated by the developed derivations showed very high correlations with the one observed in large simulated progenies, but those were lower when phased parental haplotypes were not available or family size decreased. The correlation between segregation variance estimated by the developed derivation and the empirical data was low. This could be attributed to the small family size used in the study, which we could show to increase LD between unlinked loci. The proposed algebraic derivations promise to be a precise alternative to simulations to help breeders in optimizing their family choices and sizes considering the segregation variance.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

PWAS relies on an ancestry-matched reference panel to model protein expression using genetic variants as features and determine the protein's impact on phenotype. However, reference panels from underrepresented populations remain relatively limited. In this study, we developed an analytic framework that borrows information from potentially multiple ancestries to boost the protein abundance prediction accuracy in an underrepresented population. We illustrate the framework's utility and reproducibility through application to PWAS in East Asians: BioBank Japan (BBJ), Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), and Taiwan Biobank (TWB). An ensemble of information-sharing approaches was integrated to build the Multi-Ancestry-based Best-performing Model (MABM). MABM substantially improved the prediction performance with higher performance observed in both cross-validation and an external validation dataset (Tongji-Huaxi-Shuangliu Birth Cohort). Leveraging the BBJ, we identified three times as many significant PWAS associations with MABM as with the baseline Lasso model. Notably, 47.5% of the MABM specific associations were reproduced in independent East Asian datasets with concordant effect sizes. Furthermore, MABM enhanced gene/protein prioritization for downstream functional validation by (1) confirming a greater number of well-established gene/protein-trait associations and (2) identifying previously uncharacterized trait-associated genes. The benefits of MABM were further validated in additional ancestries and demonstrated in brain tissue-based PWAS, underscoring its broad applicability.

M.", "abstract": "Many microbial species have developed adaptations for coping with life in extreme cold and in particular in the cryosphere. Ice-binding proteins (IBPs) play a critical role in enabling organisms to survive in extreme cold environments. IBPs can be divided into two distinct functional classes - antifreeze proteins (AFPs) and ice-nucleation proteins (INPs). These classes have been identified based on their specific modes of interaction with ice. Here, we introduce PLM-ICE, a computational system designed to predict IBPs with high precision and sensitivity. Leveraging ESM-2 embeddings, which incorporate evolutionary and functional sequence signals more effectively than conventional embeddings, our model employs a frozen ESM-2 encoder coupled to a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) prediction head. The application of this architecture allows for accurate determination of AFPs and INPs, surpassing existing methods (e.g., VotePLMs-AFP) in metrics such as Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Our findings indicate that PLM-ICE exhibits robust performance across broad datasets encompassing bacterial genomic sequences, highlighting its potential for wide-ranging implementation. Notably, the ability of ESM-2 to capture essential sequence patterns confers PLM-ICE with advantages in both basic research and industrial settings, where prompt and reliable identification of IBPs remains a priority. Further, the model's strong performance underscores the broader promise of protein language model-based pipelines for decoding complex biological networks and driving innovations in cryopreservation, food technology, and climate studies.

Membrane fusion is facilitated by fusion proteins, which are anchored in membranes by helical transmembrane domains (TMDs). Previous studies showed that TMD variations may alter the fusion efficiency, suggesting that TMDs are not merely passive anchors, however the mechanism by which TMDs drive fusion is not well understood. We used high-throughput coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to quantify effects of TMDs on the formation of the first fusion intermediate, that is, of a fusion stalk. We analyzed five physiologically relevant TMDs derived from viral fusion proteins and the SNARE complex embedded in various lipid environments. We find that the addition of TMDs favors stalk formation by typically 10 to 30 kJ/mol in a concentration-dependent manner. Using helices with sequences R2LnR2 (n=6..., 26), we find that negative hydrophobic mismatch between the TMD and the membrane core strongly promotes fusion. Analysis of the lipid tail order parameters of annular lipids revealed a strong correlation between stalk stabilization and induced lipid disorder. Together, our findings suggest that TMDs actively contribute to membrane fusogenicity by locally perturbing the membrane order.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

In vitro, the introduction of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) into one leaflet of lipid bilayers is frequently utilized to regulate membrane protein activity. In vivo, the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to diacylglycerol (DAG) in one leaflet can also modulate membrane protein activities. However, the effects of such variations in lipid composition, lipid quantity, and particularly the asymmetry of lipid distribution on the properties and morphology of biomembranes remain to be fully elucidated. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the asymmetric distribution of LPC and the asymmetric conversion of PIP2 induce asymmetric alterations in membrane structures and lipid dynamics. Such alterations can generate an imbalance in the lateral pressure distribution between the two leaflets, potentially leading to membrane curvature. The extent of membrane curvature is also influenced by the length and degree of unsaturation of the lipid acyl tail chain.

Particularly, the therapeutic efficacy of sHDL particles is attributed to their ability to promote reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), a process where accumulated cholesterol is transported from peripheral tissues to the liver for elimination. Here, we designed two novel apoA-I mimetic peptides (22A-F and 22A-P-18A) by modifying the sequence of the well-studied apoA-I mimetic peptide 22A. These modifications were intended to improve cholesterol efflux from macrophages in vitro and structural stability of sHDL particles in human plasma while preserving their ability to activate lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). We performed a systematic examination of the potency of sHDL particles made with these peptides in cellular cholesterol efflux, activation of LCAT, plasma HDL remodeling and proteolytic stability. Our study highlights that these modifications improve cholesterol efflux and, in the case of 22A-P-18A, also cholesterol esterification rate by LCAT but they do not appear to influence HDL remodeling in human plasma. Nonetheless, the LCAT activity assay conducted in human plasma suggest that intact sHDL particles are present and are likely the primary contributors to the increased cholesterol esterification rate, rather than the pre-{beta} HDL fraction generated through HDL remodeling. These findings offer new mechanistic insights into how specific peptide modifications affect key steps in RCT, laying the groundwork for future studies to explore their functional relevance in atherosclerosis and HDL-based drug delivery applications.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

CK1 supports optimal DNA sensing by preventing the proteasomal degradation of cGAS driven by the cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase 3 (CRL3). Conversely, CK1 facilitates STING degradation and signaling termination in response to STING agonists, tempering IRF3 activation. Exploiting these counterposing functions, we show that selective degradation of CK1 with molecular-glue degraders impaired the survival of a triple-negative breast cancer cell line with chronic cGAS-STING activation and synergized with a STING agonist to kill acute myeloid leukemia cells.

Host immune systems in particular are frequent targets of parasite-driven selection. The resulting rapid evolution of immune genes is usually framed as ongoing arms race between a co-evolving pair of host and parasite species. But, often immune evolution may be driven by the acquisition of a new and unfamiliar parasite. For instance, when marine populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) colonized freshwater lakes ~12,000 years ago, they encountered and evolved resistance to a freshwater-restricted tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus. We compared the transcriptomic responses of lab-reared stickleback from three populations with varying tapeworm susceptibility (naive marine, susceptible lake, and resistant lake), when exposed to several immune stimuli. The resulting changes in expression reveal strong evidence for shared and population-specific responses during evolution of defense against a new parasite. Our investigation highlights the roles of several key immunological processes in underlying a general physiological response to tissue damage (fibrosis), and the importance of regulation of this fibrosis as a necessary step for its co-option into parasite defense. Furthermore, we highlight changes in expression of fibrosis-associated genes which facilitate faster and more targeted deployment of this defense against parasites; fish from resistant populations have higher and more consistent expression of fibrosis genes, which experience strong negative feedback in response to cestode stimuli only. Combined, our results provide strong evidence that changes in gene regulation and increased negative feedback to mitigate immunepathology are essential steps in the evolution of novel parasite defense.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

However, assuming a simple linear relationship between DNA methylation and age does not align with the phenotype of human development and the aging process. This study aimed to investigate the existence of DNA methylation patterns with peaks or troughs at specific ages in addition to simple linear changes. Methods: A large-scale dataset of genome-wide DNA methylation data from 10,420 individuals was analyzed. Hierarchical multiple regression models were applied to detect patterns of the association between age and DNA methylation: linear increase, linear decrease, U-shaped curve, and inverse U-shaped curve. Results: Among the 864,627 CpG sites analyzed, 8.4% exhibited an increase in DNA methylation with age, 23.9% showed a decrease, and 5.5% were better explained by a quadratic model (P < 5.7815*10^-8). Within the non-linear subset, inverse U-shaped CpG sites peaking in methylation during middle age were predominant. Genes exhibiting quadratic association patterns between DNA methylation and age, and those linked to diseases with common onset during middle age, were also detected. Conclusions: Non-linear age-related DNA methylation patterns, with peaks or troughs occurring at specific ages, were detected. This suggests that humans do not simply age linearly, but that programmed mechanisms or cascade-like processes may exist to promote or suppress the expression of specific genes at certain ages, contributing onset of certain diseases at specific timings.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

The scaling exponent b(n) emerges naturally from the logarithmic relationship between consecutive Fibonacci numbers, varying systematically with the organism's developmental stage. A refined logarithmic formulation significantly enhances quantitative agreement with empirical metabolic data across various mammalian species. This discrete framework effectively captures deviations from classical scaling laws, directly connecting recursive hierarchical structures with metabolic processes.

{"title": "Theta-paced stimulation of the thalamic nucleus reuniens en-trains mPFC-HPC oscillations and facilitates the acquisition of extinction memories", "doi": "10.1101/2025.08.15.670624", "authors": "Tuna, T.; Mourao, F.; Maren, S.", "abstract": "The nucleus reuniens (RE) is a midline thalamic nucleus interconnecting the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HPC), structures known to be involved in aversive memory processes. Recent work indicates that the RE plays a critical role in the acquisition and retrieval of fear extinction memories. Specifically, the RE coordinates theta oscillations between the mPFC and HPC during extinction retrieval. Pharmacological inactivation of the RE impairs both mPFC-HPC theta coherence and the retrieval of extinction memory. Furthermore, theta-paced (8-Hz) optogenetic stimulation of the RE prevents fear renewal after extinction, a common form of fear relapse. However, it remains unclear whether theta-paced RE stimulation can entrain theta oscillations in the mPFC and HPC, and whether such entrainment is sufficient to facilitate the acquisition of extinction memories. To this end, we performed theta-paced optogenetic stimulation of the RE in adult male and female Long-Evans rats during extinction training. Animals underwent auditory fear conditioning, extinction, and an extinction retrieval test, each separated by 24 h. During extinction, 8-Hz stimulation of the RE was delivered concurrently with the presentation of the conditioned stimuli (CS). Theta-paced stimulation of the RE during extinction training significantly decreased freezing behavior compared to the control group. Notably, this reduction in conditioned behavior was also evident during the subsequent stimulation-free retrieval test, suggesting that RE stimulation not only suppresses conditioned fear responses acutely, but also facilitates the acquisition of long-term extinction memories. In a separate set of animals, we observed that theta-paced RE stimulation markedly enhanced both neural activity and entrained oscillations in the mPFC and dHPC at 8-Hz. This work suggests that the RE oscillatory activity is critical for the acquisition of extinction memories through the modulation of hippocampal-prefrontal network dynamics.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}

A.; Kudla, G. A.", "abstract": "Interpreting the effects of genetic variants remains a major challenge in recessive diseases, where clinical outcomes often depend on interactions between alleles. Multiplex assays of variant effects (MAVEs) measure variant function at scale, but nonlinear relationships with biochemical activity complicate the interpretation of MAVE scores. Here, we describe a broadly applicable approach to estimate enzymatic activities for thousands of genetic variants using a pair of fitness assays conducted at different expression levels, by modelling the nonlinear relationship between activity and fitness. Activity scores from two alleles are then combined into a single pathogenicity metric that captures their joint effect. We applied this approach to adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL), a purine biosynthesis enzyme mutated in the autosomal recessive disorder ADSL deficiency. Using a yeast-based MAVE, we quantified the functional impact of over 8,000 coding variants. Our framework distinguished pathogenic from benign alleles based on estimated activity, and the integrated pathogenicity score correlated strongly with biochemical measurements from patient-derived cells, outperforming existing computational predictors. This dual innovation - the mechanistic transformation of MAVE data and allelic integration - offers a generalizable strategy for probing enzyme function and interpreting genetic variation in recessive disorders.", "date": "2025-08-16", "journal": ""}
