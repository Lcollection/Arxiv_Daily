The diagnosis of MS is defined due to the urgency for biomarkers with both reliability and efficiency. Demyelination of axons are deeply involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Our study aims to identify the underlying molecular mechanism and screening for related biomarkers and signaling pathways. We obtained next generation sequencing (NGS) dataset (GSE138614) from the GEO database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened by the DESeq2 package in R bioconductor with considering specific criteria. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis were performed; a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed; significant modules were analyzed and hub genes were identified by Human Integrated Protein-Protein Interaction rEference (HiPPIE). Subsequently, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network, TF-hub gene regulatory network and drug-hub gene interaction network were built by Cytoscape to predict the underlying microRNAs (miRNAs), transcription factors (TFs) and drugs associated with hub genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis was performed to calculate diagnostic value of hub genes. Finally, we performed molecular docking study for prediction of drug molecules against protein targets. A total of 959 DEGs (479 up-regulated and 480 down-regulated genes) were identified in the MS samples and compared with normal control samples. The DEGs were predominantly enriched in an ensemble of genes encoding the immune system process, developmental process, immune system and regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis by SREBP (SREBF). A PPI network was obtained through HiPPIE analysis, and the results were imported into Cytoscape software. The DEGs were sequenced by the Network Analyzer plug-in by various calculation methods, and 10 hub genes (LCK, PYHIN1, SLAMF1, DOK2, TAB2, CFTR, RHOB, LMNA, EGLN3 and ERBB3) were finally selected. Based on the miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network construction, miRNAs including hsa-mir-6794-3p, hsa-mir-3689a-3p, hsa-mir-4651, hsa-mir-548q, BRCA1, HNF4A, TFAP2C and NR2F1 were determined to be potential key biomarkers. Drug-hub gene interaction network constructed from DrugBank, which identified targeted therapeutic drugs (Palivizumab, Cu-Bicyclam, Lumacaftor and Zonisamide) for the hub genes. From molecular docking study we showed good drug - protein bind affinity and amino acid interactions. This study identified novel biomarkers for MS and established a reliable diagnostic model as well as predicted novel drug molecules. The transcriptional changes identified may help to reveal the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms of MS.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Traditional antibiotics are becoming less effective due to the emergence of drug-resistant bacterial strains. The need to treat biofilms on medical implants is particularly acute, and one persistent challenge is selectively directing nanoparticles to the biofilm site. Here, we present a protein-based functionalization strategy that targets the extracellular matrix of biofilms. The protein, derived from the extracellular Staphylococcus epidermidis autolysin, directs nanoparticles to S. epidermidis cell wall components, which are not expected to be present in mammalian tissues. This functionalization is applied to a gold nanoparticle (AuNP) core, along with elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs), which generate a robust photothermal response. In addition to biofilm targeting, the particles exhibit low protein binding, and the photothermal conversion can be modulated by changing the ELP transition temperature. These functionalized AuNPs strongly interact with biofilms under static and flow conditions but exhibit weak interactions with serum-coated surfaces. Near-infrared laser irradiation resulted in a 10,000-fold improvement in killing efficiency compared to untreated controls (p < 0.0001). The targeting strategy utilized here represents a versatile approach to targeting drug-resistant infections and could be readily expanded to other anti-biofilm nanoparticle platforms.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

The optimal phenotypes exhibit dominant near-equal Boltzmann probabilities of distinct structures, each representing the fittest structure for each alternating environment. Our findings demonstrate that phenotypic plasticity, a widespread biological phenomenon, is a fundamental evolutionary response to changing environments for RNA secondary structure.

However, their precise contributions to gene regulation remain incompletely understood. This study explores the functions of lamin A, LMNA, and SYNE2 in gene expression, with a particular focus on their influence on distal chromatin interactions and conformational changes.

To overcome these limitations, we propose two novel feature embedding modes (SNP-context and whole-genome) based on DNABERT-2, a cross-species genomic foundation model that uses self-attention mechanisms and transfer learning to automatically identify conserved sequence features across diverse evolutionary lineages without prior biological assumptions. The whole-genome feature embedding aggregates genomic information at a global scale by pooling vectors from chunked sequences processed by DNABERT-2, whereas the context feature embedding captures local information by directly encoding variable-length (500--3000 bp) sequences centered on target SNPs. To reduce noise in the high-dimensional feature embeddings, we employed principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) to project the features into a lower-dimensional space. We generated two kinds of feature embedding for three crop datasets (rice413, rice395, and maize301), investigated the impact of 500--3000 bp flanking SNP contexts on phenotypic prediction, and compared prediction accuracy variations across algorithms at 4--768 feature dimensions among the PCA, PLS, and no dimensionality reduction strategies. The results demonstrate that machine learning (ML) algorithms operating under the SNP-context embedding mode achieve greater accuracy and lower mean absolute errors (MAEs) than traditional SNP features do at specific context lengths, particularly for traits with low-to-moderate heritability (h2[isin](0.2, 0.7]). In contrast, using whole-genome embeddings as input for ML can further improve the prediction accuracy for highly heritable traits (h2[isin](0.7, 1.0]), even outperforming state-of-the-art deep learning models (such as DNNGP and ResGS) that rely on SNP markers.

Current clustering-based dynamic functional network connectivity methods often fail to capture overlapping states; meanwhile, independent component analysis (ICA)-based methods typically rely on group-level analysis, limiting subject-specific accuracy. To address this gap, we introduce a novel analytical framework estimating individualized dynamic double functional independent primitives (ddFIP)-based states. Our methodological innovation includes: (1) a two-stage ICA combining spatially constrained ICA to define group-level intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs), followed by constrained ICA to estimate subject-specific states and timecourses; (2) calibration ensuring derived states preserve original correlation scales, enabling meaningful cross-subject and group-level comparisons; and (3) novel metrics leveraging this calibrated representation, including amplitude convergence (uniformity of simultaneous state contributions), amplitude divergence (variability of states independent of state dominance), and dynamic state density (number of concurrently active states at any given time). Validating our framework on an extensive resting-state fMRI dataset (N > 5.5K) spanning four neuropsychiatric conditions revealed disorder-specific connectivity signatures: schizophrenia exhibited extensive variability (increased divergence), while autism displayed pronounced stability (increased convergence). In summary, our proposed method uniquely integrates subject-specific ICA estimation, unit-preserving calibration, and novel convergence-divergence metrics, providing data-driven biomarkers that differentiating psychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

In this study, we introduce GENERanno, a compact yet powerful genomic foundation model (GFM) specifically optimized for metagenomic annotation. Trained on an extensive dataset comprising 715 billion base pairs (bp) of prokaryotic DNA, GENERanno employs a transformer encoder architecture with 500 million parameters, enabling bidirectional attention over sequences up to 8192 bp at single-nucleotide resolution. This design addresses key limitations of existing methods, including the inability of traditional Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to handle fragmented DNA sequences from multi-species microbial communities, as well as the suboptimal tokenization schemes of existing GFMs that compromise fine-grained analysis. At its core, GENERanno excels in identifying coding regions from fragmented and mixed DNA sequences, a hallmark of metagenomic analysis. It achieves superior accuracy compared to traditional HMM-based methods (e.g., GLIMMER3, GeneMarkS2, Prodigal) and recent LLM-based approaches (e.g., GeneLM), while demonstrating robust generalization ability on archaeal genomes. Leveraging its advanced contextual understanding capability, GENERanno further enables two essential functions: pseudogene prediction and taxonomic classification, both performed based solely on raw sequence data, without reliance on reference databases or comparative genomics. These functionalities collectively streamline the metagenomic analysis pipeline, significantly reducing preprocessing requirements and enabling end-to-end interpretation of sequencing data. Beyond its primary role in metagenomic annotation, GENERanno also serves as a powerful GFM. To evaluate its broader utility, we curated the Prokaryotic Gener Tasks, a comprehensive benchmark suite specifically tailored for prokaryotic genomic analysis. It includes gene fitness prediction, antibiotic resistance identification, gene classification, and taxonomic classification, reflecting diverse aspects of functional genomics. On this benchmark, GENERanno consistently outperforms existing GFMs such as DNABERT-2, NT-v2, and GenomeOcean, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across a wide range of genomic tasks. Overall, GENERanno provides a unified framework that integrates multiple critical functions for metagenomic annotation and beyond. By eliminating dependencies on external resources and offering rich contextual understanding of genomic sequences, this work delivers a foundational tool for advancing functional genomics in complex microbial communities.

More recent data indicate that the PnO is also under GABAergic control -which gates REM sleep- thereby highlighting the importance of interactions between cholinergic and GABAergic processes as a key mechanism in REM sleep regulation. Here we employed a rat mesopontine slice preparation to investigate, in vitro, the modulation of GABAergic inputs to PnO neurons by cholinergic agents. Carbachol, a mixed muscarinic-nicotinic cholinergic agonist, provoked either depression or facilitation of single monosynaptic GABAergic IPSCs evoked by extracellular stimulation of the region of brainstem tegmental nuclei. Both effects were presynaptic in origin and are likely attributable to the activation of distinct presynaptic cholinergic receptors as depression was replicated by muscarine (presynaptic inhibition) and facilitation by nicotine (presynaptic facilitation). Furthermore, IPSCs evoked by stimulation patterns mimicking physiological activity (short trains at 15 Hz) were also affected by cholinergic agonists. Muscarine caused presynaptic inhibition accompanied by frequency facilitation and nicotine promoted the opposite effect. Notably, both agonists reduced the total inhibitory charge transferred to postsynaptic neurons during the stimulus train. These findings suggest an additional mechanism by which cholinergic modulation can relieve GABAergic inhibition of PnO neurons under physiological conditions, serving as a local component of the reciprocal inhibitory interactions between sleep-regulating networks in REM sleep brainstem executive areas.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Among sensory modalities, tactile perception is particularly critical for daily functioning and social interactions. While these sensory alterations are thought to contribute to the cognitive differences observed in autism, the impact of cognitive processes--such as categorization, prior experience, and attention--on sensory perception remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the influence of top-down cognitive processes on tactile perception in the Fmr1-/y genetic mouse model of autism. We developed a translational, forepaw-based decision-making task designed to dissociate stimulus-driven tactile responses from those modulated by cognitive factors. This approach enabled us to assess multiple aspects of perceptual processing, including perceptual learning, stimulus categorization and discrimination, as well as the influence of prior experience and attention. Mice were initially trained to distinguish between high- and low-salience stimuli and were subsequently tested with a continuum of intermediate stimulus intensities. Our results revealed salience-dependent cognitive alterations that significantly influenced sensory performance. During the training phase, Fmr1-/y mice exhibited an increased choice consistency bias in low-salience trials, resulting in impaired perceptual learning. In the testing phase, Fmr1-/y mice demonstrated enhanced tactile discrimination under low-salience conditions, driven by a reduced influence of categorization during decision-making. However, increased tactile discrimination was dissociable from attention, with Fmr1-/y mice displaying attentional deficits under conditions of high cognitive load despite their enhanced tactile sensitivity. Together, our findings reveal that cognitive context critically shapes sensory phenotypes in autism. They advocate for a shift beyond traditional sensory-cognitive dichotomies to better capture the dynamic interplay between perceptual and cognitive alterations in autism.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

In this study, we assessed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on 29 participants with MitoD and 62 matched controls during resting state and tasks probing cognitive (N-back task), affective (cold pain), and sensory (multisensory visual and auditory perception) functions. MitoD individuals exhibited significant cognitive deficits across a range of functions, including executive function and working memory, mental and physical fatigability, low exercise tolerance, and low mood. These deficits were accompanied by markedly elevated blood levels of metabolic stress markers, including GDF15 and FGF21. Surprisingly, overall BOLD fMRI activity and connectivity were largely intact across all tasks in MitoD individuals. However, those with more severe cognitive impairment and higher GDF15 levels showed reduced working memory-related activity, which in turn mediated poorer task performance. Conversely, individuals with relatively preserved cognitive function exhibited hyperactivation in working memory regions and working memory performance compared to controls, suggesting compensatory engagement of cortical systems in high-functioning MitoD individuals. These effects were weaker in the sensory domain and absent during affective (cold pain) processing, suggesting an energy hierarchy in the brain that prioritizes essential functions such as affective responses while downregulating more energy-demanding, complex cognitive processes when resources are limited.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

IT-type neurons showed opposing changes in mushroom and thin spines that were: 1) consistent with increasing synaptic maturity and 2) largely absent in PT-type neurons. We next probed the function of brain-resident immune cells, microglia, by transiently ablating them within the mPFC at mid-adolescence. This led to cell type-dependent changes in dendritic spines in late adolescence, with thin spine proportion increasing on both cell types but total spine density increasing on IT-type neurons only. Meanwhile, there was no effect on performance in an mPFC-dependent task of cognitive flexibility at either late adolescent or adult time points following microglia ablation. These findings provide evidence that mPFC IT-type neurons undergo greater spine remodeling during adolescence compared to PT-type neurons and implicate microglia as potential mediators.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

However, their specific contributions to motor and non-motor functions remain elusive. Using Calbindin 1 (Calb1) and Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 (Aldh1a1) as molecular markers, we investigated the functions of these nigrostriatal DAN subtypes in mice. Through intersectional genetics and chemogenetic manipulation, we selectively inhibited Calb1+ or Aldh1a1+ DANs by stereotactically delivering an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV-CreOn-FlpOn-hM4Di-P2A-mCherry) into the SNc of ThFlp; Calb1IRESCre or ThFlp; Aldh1a1CreERT2 double knock-in (KI) mice. This approach enabled subtype-specific neuronal inhibition via designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD). Following DREADD ligand administration, both Calb1+ and Aldh1a1+ DAN-inhibited mice exhibited significant reduction in voluntary movement and impaired motor skill learning, demonstrating their essential roles in motor function. However, only Calb1+ DAN inhibition affected early associative-learning behavior, suggesting a unique role in reinforcement learning. These findings establish Calb1+ and Aldh1a1+ nigrostriatal DANs as key regulators of movement and motor learning, with Calb1+ neurons additionally modulating reward-based associative learning. This study advances our understanding of the functional heterogeneity of nigrostriatal DAN subtypes and identifies potential therapeutic targets for addressing motor and non-motor deficits in Parkinson's disease.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

It is caused by a CGG repeat expansion in FMR1 gene that leads to the loss of fragile X messenger ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMRP). FMRP is highly abundant in synapses, where regulates mRNAs to maintain synaptic plasticity. Treatments under development significantly ameliorate neurological and behavioral landmarks in the mouse model of the disorder, the Fmr1 knockout (FX) mouse. Specifically, previous studies revealed that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) restored phenotypic traits in FX mice. However, the molecular hallmarks associated with this experimental therapeutic intervention are largely unknown. Methods First, we aimed to evaluate the validity of synaptoneurosomes preparations to investigate specific mRNA modifications at synapses. Afterwards, combining in silico high-throughput analysis and biochemical determinations, we analyzed the hippocampal synaptoneurosomal transcriptome after pharmacological inhibition of CB1R with the specific antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant in FX male mice Results We verified that synaptoneurosomes provide an accurate representation of synaptic composition and function. Then, we found that rimonabant treatment had a limited impact at gene expression level but produced significant modifications in transcript expression. Indeed, detailed analysis of alternative splicing events revealed a relevant number of events in which splicing was reverted from the FX form to the WT form by the treatment. Limitations We demonstrated that rimonabant treatment alters the AS landscape in FX hippocampal synaptoneurosomes; however, further studies are needed to elucidate if other neural components also contribute to the modifications and whether the findings are specific to rimonabant treatment or to CB1R inhibition at synapses. In addition, additional research could be required to clarify whether the changes in AS events could be affected by interindividual variability or technical protocols. Conclusions We determined that the AS landscape is modified in FX hippocampal synaptoneurosomes and that these changes are sensitive to rimonabant treatment which could explain the beneficial effects of this experimental therapeutic approach in FXS. Altogether, our results reveal a new level of complexity in the effect of pharmacological treatment to improve symptoms in the context of FXS.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Proteomic and electrophysiological characterization at different developmental time points showed that these neurons gain a proteomic profile that maps to different cortical interneuron subtypes, particularly VIP+ interneurons, and display typical GABAergic synaptic properties, producing large, synchronous and picrotoxin-sensitive currents. During early development synaptic strength increased threefold, which was accompanied by enhanced expression of multiple GABA-specific presynaptic gene sets, but few changes in postsynaptic gene sets. Synaptic strength continued to improve during late development but with only minor proteomic changes. Co-seeding with NGN2 neurons created stable networks of predefined excitation/inhibition ratios, with corresponding synapse ratios.

However, most current knowledge relies on studies of bulk tissue or isolated brain regions. Here, we present a large-scale single-cell analysis of transcriptomic sex differences in the human brain, using 169 samples from 15 females and 15 males across six cortical regions, selected based on in vivo neuroimaging measures of sex-biased volume. We find that sex effects on gene expression are highly patterned across cortical regions, cell types, and genes. They are most pronounced in: i) multiple cell types in the fusiform cortex (linked to male-biased volume and sex-biased behaviors); ii) oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and excitatory neurons across regions; and iii) a subset of sex chromosome and autosomal genes. Over 3,000 unique genes exhibit sex-biased expression, with 133 genes (119 autosomal) showing consistent sex differences across all region x cell type combinations. Sex chromosome genes show the largest sex differences in expression, driven by conserved X-Y gametologs, cell-type-specific biases in certain X- and Y-linked genes, and escape from X-inactivation - with the list of known escapees substantially expanded through our single-cell allele-specific expression analysis. Broader effects of sex on autosomal expression are captured in 13 core signatures with varying cell type vs. region specificity. These signatures are: i) shaped by regional differences in metabolism and laminar architecture; ii) enriched for diverse cellular compartments and biological processes; iii) regulated by sex steroids and X-linked transcription factors; and iv) linked to sex-specific genetic risk factors in sex-biased neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases.

The hummingbird genus Patagona comprises two species, near identical in plumage and morphology, that differ in almost every aspect of their ecology and evolution: The Northern Giant Hummingbird (Patagona peruviana) and Southern Giant Hummingbird (Patagona gigas). Here, we characterized the songs of both giant hummingbird species and assessed whether song can be used to distinguish the two in the field. We recorded both species in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile in 2023 and 2025 and used public data to analyze song variation of 217 individuals recorded across the Andes. Sampling spanned 49 years, >36 degrees of latitude, and >4,300 meters in elevation. We first quantified species-level song differences in allopatric breeding populations and trained a linear discriminant model to identify individuals to species. The trained model had 100% classification accuracy. We then used our trained model to identify individuals recorded during co-occurring, non-breeding periods of overlap, and subsequently analyzed range-wide song variation; this model had 98.72% classification accuracy (1.28% error rate; one individual misidentified). We found striking song divergence between the two species, uncovering that Northern and Southern Giant Hummingbirds can be reliably and easily identified by song across their ranges and during any month of the year. We provide new data on the range limits of both species in northern Bolivia, highlighting a previously unknown zone of overlap around Lake Titicaca.

D.", "abstract": "The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is of considerable biomedical importance, yet there remains a need to characterize the evolutionary forces shaping empirically observed patterns of genomic variation in the species. However, two uncommon biological traits potentially prevent the use of standard population genetic approaches in this primate: a high frequency of twin-births and the prevalence of hematopoietic chimerism. Here we characterize the impact of these biological features on the inference of natural selection, and directly model twinning and chimerism when performing inference of the distribution of fitness effects to characterize general selective dynamics as well as when scanning the genome for loci shaped by the action of episodic positive and balancing selection. Results suggest a generally increased degree of purifying selection relative to human populations, consistent with the larger estimated effective population size of common marmosets. Furthermore, genomic scans based on an appropriate evolutionary baseline model reveal a small number of genes related to immunity, sensory perception, and reproduction to be strong sweep candidates. Notably, two genes in the major histocompatibility complex were found to have strong evidence of being maintained by balancing selection, in agreement with observations in other primate species. Taken together, this work, presenting the first whole-genome characterization of selective dynamics in the common marmoset, thus provides important insights into the landscape of both persistent and episodic selective forces in this species.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have found that average causal effects are similar across ancestries, but empirical evidence and theoretical considerations suggest that interactions may still contribute to poor portability of polygenic scores. Here, we leverage the ancestry mosaicism of admixed individuals to develop models of genetic interactions with local and global ancestry. We show that these models capture epistasis but are also consistent with highly similar average causal effects, clarifying that the latter observation does not exclude the possibility of gene-ancestry interaction. Next, we investigate how models of local and global interactions differ in polygenic prediction. Focusing on continuous traits, we show that if causal variants are known and causal effects differ across ancestries, then the global and local models can be differentiated using partial polygenic scores --- scores computed on ancestry-specific genomic segments --- while standard polygenic scores remain indistinguishable under both models. However, if causal variants are unknown, differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns confound this analysis, and the models are not practically distinguishable without knowledge of the LD between causal and tagging variants.

Encapsulation of AAV vectors within engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) is an emerging strategy which could help overcome challenges including pre-existing anti-capsid immunity and the need for controlling targeting and tropism. To guide the development of EV-AAV technologies, we developed an assay for quantifying and controlling for the contribution of pseudotransduction to evaluations of EV-AAV-mediated gene delivery. We developed an AAV vector that switches its transgene output from one reporter to another when acted upon by Cre recombinase expressed in a recipient cell. Using this platform, we investigated EV-AAV transduction as a function of various engineered EV surface modifications. For actively endocytic cells (HEK293FTs), modifications that enhance EV uptake and membrane fusion influence protein delivery but not gene delivery. Conversely, in less endocytic Jurkat T cells, modifications enhancing EV uptake improved both protein and gene delivery. These conclusions held across multiple AAV serotypes. Our results resolve apparent conflicts in prior reports and suggest that effects of enhancing uptake and membrane fusion of EV-AAV vectors are recipient cell type specific. The methods developed here unambiguously dissect EV-AAV transduction mechanisms and can guide future bioengineering of EV-AAV vectors.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Treatment of P. aeruginosa is further complicated by its ability to form biofilms. Anionic compounds within the biofilm and thick cystic fibrosis mucus interact with cationic antimicrobials, hindering treatment efficacy. In this study, we investigated the treatment of lung infections by delivering antimicrobials via polyelectrolyte surfactants that are composed of an anionic poly(alkylacrylic acid) backbone with grafted polyetheramine pendent chains. When combined with cationic antimicrobials, they self-assemble into nanoparticles via electrostatic interactions. We assessed the role of backbone chemistry and graft density on nanoparticle physical properties and evaluated the antimicrobial activity of these formulations against planktonic and biofilm cultures of P. aeruginosa strains derived from clinical isolates. All synthesized polyelectrolyte surfactants demonstrated high levels of antimicrobial encapsulation, with the extent of drug bound corresponding to the calculated hydrophilic-lipophilic balance values. We observed significantly increased antimicrobial activity against planktonic cultures using nanoformulations containing one of the polyelectrolyte surfactants, PMAA-g-10%J. In contrast, all tested nanoformulations retained, but did not increase, activity against biofilms. By monitoring membrane potentials and nanoparticle uptake, it was found that the nanoparticles directly associate with the bacterial cell membranes, which may enhance drug delivery and underlie the improved activity against the planktonic bacteria.

MagPiezo integrates a custom-built magnetic applicator and 19 nm octahedral mixed ferrite nanoparticles (MFs) with enhanced magnetocrystalline anisotropy, engineered to selectively target Piezo1 channels. The application of a low intensity (< 40 mT), low frequency (1 Hz) magnetic field is sufficient to generate wireless torque forces in the piconewton range capable of gating Piezo1 channels in vitro. Remarkably, applying MagPiezo for short times (< 1 h) induces robust responses in endothelial cells, including calcium influx, cytoskeletal reorganization and transcriptional activation. Unlike other magnetogenetic tools, MagPiezo avoids the need to assemble the magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) into bigger beads to reach the opening threshold and does not need to genetically engineer Piezo1 channels. Moreover, it uses low magnetic field intensities and frequencies, enhancing its potential for in vivo translation. Therefore, MagPiezo is a powerful platform for manipulating Piezo1 channels and dissecting mechanotransduction events in vascular biology, paving the way for new strategies to modulate mechanoreceptors both in vitro and in vivo.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Chitinases hydrolyze chitin into chitooligomers which finds multifarious uses in various sectors and are gaining attention particularly as a biocontrol agent against chitin-containing insects and plant pathogens. Although fungi are a significant source of chitinases, the phylogenetic and functional diversity of the fungal enzymes is not well understood. In this study, we employed molecular modeling and simulation techniques to investigate the molecular characteristics of chitinase (PmChi) from a mycoparasitic fungus, Paraphaeosphaeria minitans, widely used as a biological control agent. The secondary structure of PmChi is predominantly random coil (51.24%), followed by alpha helices (28.44%) and extended strands (14.22%). PmChi contains the conserved chitinase sequence FDGLDIDWE at positions 178 to 186, where glutamic acid (E) acts as the catalytic proton donor, and aspartic acid (D) stabilizes the protein by accommodating substrate distortion. The protein surface of PmChi is rich in non-polar amino acid residues, while the active site contains more polar residues to facilitate the reaction. Key amino acids involved in catalytic activity include Trp146, Asp184, Glu186, Tyr187, Pro228, Met252, Tyr254, and Asp255. Molecular simulations demonstrated that PmChi maintained stability during interaction with chitotriose. Residual flexibility, hydrogen bonding, and structural packing showed consistent trajectories with no significant perturbations throughout the simulation.

Despite forays into the description and quantification of these punctuated events, the effects of such events on subsequent cancer evolution remain incompletely understood. Here we investigate how non-gradual mutagenesis affects the ability of tumor cells to acquire and retain fitness-enhancing adaptations. We find that punctuated mutagenesis significantly facilitates adaptation in scenarios where adaptation requires crossing a fitness valley, i.e. when multiple mutations are required which individually are maladaptive but jointly confer a fitness advantage. By increasing the probability that multiple mutations occur in close succession, punctuation increases the chance that mutants in a fitness valley mutate further to reach a fitness peak before going extinct. Analyzing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we find that tumors with signatures of APOBEC mutagenesis, which has been shown to proceed in episodic bursts, exhibit patterns consistent with higher rates of crossing fitness valleys. Lastly, we characterize how the interplay between this enhanced ability to cross fitness valleys and adaptation-limiting effects of clonal interference affects overall adaptability in complex fitness landscapes.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

B7-H3 appears to be a good target as it is overexpressed in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue. However, B7-H3 is a molecule with ambivalent functions and is expressed by different cell types. This complexity contributed to the delay in identifying cell subtypes that express B7-H3 and their potential role in colorectal oncogenesis. In this study, we used in silico bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomic data to investigate the clinical and biological characteristics of tumors with high B7-H3 expression, the precise nature of cells expressing high level of B7-H3, and their temporal appearance during colorectal oncogenesis. We found that tumors with high B7-H3 expression corresponded to tumors with a predominant stroma composed mainly of fibroblasts. Among them, two subtypes of ecm-myCAF fibroblasts and pro-fibrotic pericytes specifically expressed high levels of B7-H3, the former being an independent factor for poor prognosis in CRC. Finally, by examining precancerous lesions, we report that fibroblast subtypes with high levels of B7-H3 appear early during oncogenesis, especially at the inflamed stage. We also shed light on the fact that anti-B7-H3 immunotherapies might therefore preferentially target cells from the microenvironment rather than the tumor cells.

Given that the brain endocannabinoid system and type-1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) control memory processes and are overactive under obesogenic conditions, we studied whether the effects of obesogenic diet consumption on memory function are dependent on this system. Using an object recognition memory (ORM) task in male mice, we showed that CB1R activity is required for obesogenic diet-induced impairment of long-term memory performance. This impairment was prevented by post-training systemic blockade of CB1R, which also normalized training-induced hippocampal cellular and synaptic overactivation. Consistently, obesogenic diet potentiated the increase of hippocampal endocannabinoid levels and enhanced CB1R expression induced by ORM, and genetic CB1R deletion from hippocampal glutamatergic neurons abolished diet-induced memory deficits. Strikingly, obesogenic diet enhanced the hippocampal mTOR pathway in a CB1R-dependent manner, and pharmacological mTOR inhibition after training rescued diet-induced ORM consolidation deficits. Together, these results establish how an obesogenic environment can lead to hippocampal overactivation of the endocannabinoid system and of the mTOR pathway to eventually impair memory consolidation.

Results confirm that cerebellar lesions impair the generation of temporal predictions in cross-modal (visuo-auditory) stimulus processing, extending the role of cerebellar predictive timing from sensorimotor to motor-independent cross-modal perception.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "To successfully forage for food, animals must balance the energetic cost of searching for food sources with the energetic benefit of exploiting those sources. While the Marginal Value Theorem provides one normative account of this balance by specifying that a forager should leave a food patch when its energetic yield falls below the average yield of other patches in the environment, it assumes the presence of other readily reachable patches. In natural settings, however, a forager does not know whether it will encounter additional food patches, and it must balance potential energetic costs and benefits accordingly. Upon first encountering a patch of food, it faces a decision of whether and when to leave the patch in search of better options, and when to return if no better options are found. Here, we explore how a forager should structure its search for new food patches when the existence of those patches is unknown, and when searching for those patches requires energy that can only be harvested from a single known food patch. We identify conditions under which it is more favorable to explore the environment in several successive trips rather than in a single long exploration, and we show how the optimal sequence of trips depends on the forager's beliefs about the distribution and nutritional content of food patches in the environment. This optimal strategy is well approximated by a local decision that can be implemented by a simple neural circuit architecture. Together, this work highlights how energetic constraints and prior beliefs shape optimal foraging strategies, and how such strategies can be approximated by simple neural networks that implement local decision rules.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

While microglial pyroptosis is implicated in neuroinflammation and neural injury via inflammatory cytokine release, the role of the CASPASE-1/GSDMD pathway in PD pathogenesis remains incompletely defined. Methods 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was used to construct PD model in vivo, GSDMD-knockout mice was employed to assess pyroptotic mechanisms. MPP+-stimulated BV2 microglia were treated with a CASPASE-1 inhibitor in vitro. Microglia-specific GSDMD conditional knockout mice were generated to evaluate cell-type contributions to neuroinflammation and motor deficits. Results GSDMD deficiency attenuated MPTP-induced neuroinflammation, dopaminergic neuron loss, and motor dysfunction in vivo. MPP+ exposure triggered NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in BV2 microglia, which was suppressed by CASPASE-1 inhibition. Critically, microglia-specific GSDMD ablation mitigated nigrostriatal degeneration and dyskinesia in PD mice, confirming the centrality of microglial pyroptosis. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that microglia drive neuroinflammation in PD via CASPASE-1/GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis, directly linking this pathway to dopaminergic neurodegeneration and motor impairment. Targeting GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis represents a promising therapeutic strategy.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

In this context, it is becoming increasingly important to characterize the neural activity manifold, the set of configurations visited by the network within the space defined by the instantaneous firing rates of all neurons. The intrinsic dimension (ID) of the manifold is a key parameter allowing to relate neural trajectories with the ongoing network computations. While several studies suggested that the ID may be typically low in neural manifolds, contrasting findings have disputed this statement, leading to a wide debate. Part of the disagreement may stem from the lack of a shared and robust methodology to measure the ID. In the case of curvature, linear methods tend to overestimate the ID; in the case of undersampling, nonlinear methods tend underestimate it. Here we show that adapting the full correlation integral (FCI) method yields an estimator that is robust to both curvature and undersampling. We tested our metric on artificial data, including neural trajectories generated recurrent neural networks (RNNs) performing simple tasks and a benchmark dataset consisting of non-linearly embedded high-dimensional data.

LatenZy estimates neuronal response onset latency, while latenZy2 detects when spiking activity diverges between conditions. We validate these methods on electrophysiological datasets from mouse and macaque visual cortex, and show that they outperform standard approaches in precision, robustness, sensitivity, and statistical power. LatenZy captures contrast-dependent latency shifts and hierarchical timing across visual areas, and latenZy2 reveals earlier attentional modulation in higher visual cortex consistent with top-down feedback.

Here we analyzed the data of two experiments and explored the potential in decoding the time-frequency representation in face processing, thus extracting not only temporal but also the frequency distribution. In the two experiments, participants were presented with faces and through changing the presentation number per face, we manipulated their familiarity. Then we determined the time window of facial sex related cortical activities with frequently employed decoding techniques on the preprocessed data. Subsequently, we performed Fourier transformation on the data and decoded time-frequency spectrum of the amplitude, the phase and also the complex Fourier spectrum. This analysis revealed a 500 ms long time window at the beginning of the stimulus presentation in the 2 to 17 Hz frequency range, which showed above-chance decoding accuracies in the case of more familiar faces. Less familiar faces showed similar, albeit more restricted time-frequency windows. By comparing the two experiments we also observed 350 ms long window in the low frequencies of 4-10 Hz, where familiar faces exhibited greater decoding accuracies. This method expanded on the generally observed time-window and complemented it with a frequency distribution related to facial sex processing.

O.", "abstract": "Meter, the organization of beats into regular groupings, is a core element of music perception. Switches in meters frequently occur in music, reflecting the interplay between top-down attentional processes and the bottom-up processing of acoustic features. To disentangle this interplay in meter perception, we had previously invented a sound stimulus that simultaneously contained two meters. This dual-meter stimulus consisted of band-limited noise bursts that varied in center frequency and duration, with one feature following a triple-meter pattern and the other following a quadruple-meter pattern. Thus, the perceived meter switches between the two by changing attention from one acoustic feature to another, even when listening to identical stimuli. Using these stimuli, we here demonstrated the neural processes involved in meter perception by recording electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, while dissociating the influence of acoustic differences. We first found that the perceived meter structure was reflected in the entrained neural oscillations by comparing the spectral profiles of EEG signals when the participants focused on triple-meter versus quadruple-meter features. Second, an event-related potential component for anticipation (P300) was observed when the expected meter structure was disrupted by altering the frequency or duration of one sound at the end of the stimulus. Notably, individuals with stronger neural entrainment exhibited larger P300 responses to these disruptions. Our findings suggest that top-down attention modulates anticipation of the meter structure, and this anticipation induces neural entrainment that is involved in meter perception.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Locomotor output in vertebrates is generated in the spinal cord but is initiated and controlled by descending projections from supraspinal structures. Spinal interneurons involved in locomotion have been revealed through manipulation of genetically identified interneurons in transgenic mouse lines. Lumbar spinal interneurons expressing the transcription factor Shox2 include putative locomotor rhythm generating neurons in mice. The direct connection between supraspinal and lumbar spinal locomotor-related interneurons is comprised of reticulospinal neurons which are thought to directly provide drive to spinal rhythm generating interneurons that receive descending input and convert it to a rhythmic output. Excitatory neurons in the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus (LPGi) within the medulla have been shown to provide this descending drive in the context of forward locomotor initiation. However, a direct connection between excitatory LPGi neurons and identified spinal rhythm generating neurons has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we performed viral tracing and electrophysiological recordings to test for direct connections between the LPGi and lumbar Shox2 interneurons in adult mice. Using both monosynaptic-restricted transsynaptic rabies and anterograde AAV tracing, we show that excitatory neurons from the LPGi make direct putative excitatory synaptic contacts onto lumbar spinal Shox2 interneurons. A monosynaptic connection was confirmed via recordings of excitatory postsynaptic potentials in Shox2 interneurons in lumbar spinal slices evoked by optogenetic activation of LPGi terminals. These results demonstrate that at least a subset of lumbar spinal Shox2 interneurons receive monosynaptic excitatory input from the LPGi in the medulla, a connection which may provide the substrate for the initiation of locomotion.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

This paper describes a model that achieves high source estimation accuracy and suppresses information spreading simultaneously. The proposed approach is based on a Bayesian estimation model that utilizes functional structure of the human brain. We compare the performance of the proposed model with simulated data generated under various signal-to-noise ratio conditions. The results show that the functionally-structured Bayesian model achieves source estimation accuracy that is better than that of conventional source estimation models. Additionally, the comparison of information spreading among the models reveals that our model outperforms the conventional ones.

C.", "abstract": "Background: Alzheimers disease (AD) progresses along a continuum for years to possibly decades prior to cognitive decline and clinical diagnosis. Preclinical AD is associated with neuromuscular dysfunction. We previously characterized early neuromuscular impairment prior to cognitive decline at 4 months of age in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. However, the underlying cause(s) for peripheral nerve dysfunction leading to impaired skeletal muscle torque production are not understood, therefore limiting interventional capacity. We hypothesized that either voluntary wheel running or donepezil treatment, begun prior to neuromuscular decline, would delay manifestation of neuromuscular impairment in 5xFAD mice. Methods: Sciatic nerves from 5xFAD and wild-type (WT) mice were analyzed by tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled proteomics at 3, 4, and 7 months to investigate proteome remodeling. Separate cohorts, using 3-month-old 5xFAD mice and WT littermates given voluntary wheel access for 4 weeks or treated with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil to test if neuromuscular dysfunction could be attenuated. Afterwards, we assessed tibial nerve stimulated plantar flexion torque and sciatic nerve compound (motor) neuron action potential (CNAP) in-vivo at 4 months. Additionally, we performed TMT-labeled proteomics to ascertain the effect of exercise and donepezil treatments on sciatic proteome. Results: Sciatic nerves in 5xFAD mice exhibited proteomic remodeling from 3 to 4 months, particularly in pathways linked to mitochondrial turnover, calcium handling, lipid metabolism, and inflammation, coinciding with onset of neuromuscular dysfunction. Both exercise and donepezil attenuated in nerve-stimulated muscle torque and CNAP dysfunction. Both exercise and donepezil attenuated proteomic remodeling of the sciatic nerve involving mitochondrial-centric processes through both shared and independent mechanisms. Conclusions: Declines in neuromuscular function may be pre-clinical identifiers for AD that share pathway similarities with noted central effects of the pathology on the brain.

This study examines resting-state electrophysiological mechanisms underlying VSN, with a focus on interhemispheric differences in alpha-band oscillations and their association with deficits in visual perception and attention. Methods: Resting-state EEG was recorded during three-minute eyes-closed and eyes-open periods in VSN patients. Participants also completed a battery of perceptual and attentional assessments, including the Star Cancellation Task, the Computerized Visual Detection Task, and the Line Bisection Task. Measures of alpha activity, specifically amplitude, peak frequency, and fronto-parietal connectivity, were compared between VSN patients and age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Within the VSN group, alpha activity in the lesioned and non-lesioned hemispheres was used to predict task performance. Results: Compared to healthy controls, VSN patients displayed a distinct resting-state alpha profile, characterized by slower and less synchronized alpha oscillations and reduced fronto-parietal alpha connectivity in the lesioned hemisphere. In contrast, controls showed symmetrical alpha activity across hemispheres. Crucially, the degree of interhemispheric alpha asymmetry in VSN patients consistently predicted attentional impairments across all behavioral tasks. Discussion: VSN is linked to disrupted alpha oscillatory dynamics and interhemispheric imbalance. The extent of alpha desynchronization between hemispheres predicts symptom severity, supporting the interhemispheric competition model of attention. These findings suggest that hyperactive alpha activity in the non-lesioned hemisphere may suppress the lesioned hemisphere, contributing to attentional bias away from the contralesional space.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

When school language differs from childrens home language, mathematics performance often decreases. Little is known about cortical activation during mathematics vocabulary processing in different languages. This insight will help us to better understand childrens mathematical learning in multilingual societies. Aim and approach: We investigated behavioral and brain responses (fNIRS) of 42 isiZulu and Sesotho (L1) first graders (6.75-7.83 years, 22 girls) who learn mathematics in English (L2) at school when they encounter mathematics vocabulary in L2 compared to L1; and mathematics vocabulary compared to object recognition in L1. Results: The results show that higher accuracy in the L1 mathematics vocabulary, as compared to the L2 mathematics vocabulary, comes with the costs of higher cognitive demands in the right superior and middle frontal gyri for first graders. Mathematics vocabulary required longer response time than object recognition and a higher activation in the right superior frontal gyrus. No parietal difference was observed between conditions. Conclusions: First graders with no automatization of mathematics vocabulary processing, still demand frontal cognitive resources.

Experimentally stabilizing this connectivity slows disease progression, but the dynamics of network degeneration and optimal time windows for intervention remain elusive. Using a data-driven spiking model with stage-specific degeneration and dynamic synaptic kinetics, we predict that V1 dysregulation induces hyperexcitation and flexor-biased motoneuron activity, disrupting flexor-extensor coordination, potentially contributing to selective vulnerability of flexor motoneurons. Synaptic stabilization that strengthens remaining inhibitory synapses can rescue motor output features even after loss of motoneurons. However, after sustained synaptic loss and the development of slower synaptic dynamics, synaptic stabilization leads to maladaptive extensor-biased activity, suggesting that excitatory/inhibitory balance impacts treatment effectiveness.

Here we investigate whether stimulus contrast alters attention-driven attraction towards the attended locus. We used a demanding attentional task at fixation (0.1{ring}) while mapping population receptive fields (pRFs) using either a low-contrast (5% Michelson contrast) or a high-contrast (80% Michelson contrast) checkerboard bar. Behavioral performance across conditions was matched. We show large and consistent differences in the amplitude of responses, but surprisingly, no difference in the amount of attraction towards the attended locus. The variance explained in this experiment was comparable to that of similar studies, which did observe pRF property changes, suggesting sufficient sensitivity to detect attraction towards the attended locus had it occurred at a similar magnitude.

Slow oscillatory transcranial direct current stimulation (so-tDCS) can modulate these oscillations. Traditionally, anodal so-tDCS is used to depolarize the cortex during SO up-states, thereby promoting SO activity and SO-spindle coupling. However, intracranial findings suggest that SO down-states, characterized by cortical hyperpolarization, can trigger thalamic spindle bursts. This raises the hypothesis that cathodal so-tDCS, by promoting hyperpolarization, could selectively enhance down-states and more effectively improve SO-spindle coupling. We tested this hypothesis in twenty-two healthy older adults, a population known to exhibit diminished NREM oscillatory activity. Each participant received cathodal, anodal, and sham so-tDCS in separate nap sleep sessions. We quantified SO and spindle characteristics, their temporal coupling, and cortical excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance using EEG spectral slope. We also assessed individual circadian preference (chronotype) as a potential moderator. We found that anodal so-tDCS improved SO-spindle synchrony, and increased spindle power over sham in participants with intermediate or evening chronotypes, while cathodal so-tDCS did not enhance these oscillatory measures compared to sham, despite prolonging SO down-states. Anodal stimulation also elevated E/I balance, indicating increased cortical excitability, while cathodal stimulation did not produce the anticipated opposite shift. In summary, anodal, but not cathodal so-tDCS, effectively enhanced thalamocortical interactions underlying memory consolidation. Furthermore, these findings highlight the importance of individual factors such as chronotype in brain stimulation responsiveness.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

PS19 mice, a well-established tauopathy model, exhibit hallmarks of tau pathology - including hyperphosphorylated tau and pretangle formations - in various regions of the olfactory system. Notably, very recent data demonstrated that aberrantly hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) was detected as early as 1.5 months of age in the olfactory epithelium (OE). This region contains olfactory sensory neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB), where similar pTau pattern was also observed at this early stage. By 6 months, tau pretangles were evidenced in higher olfactory areas such as the piriform and entorhinal cortices. Given the early involvement of the OE and OB in tau pathology, we performed transcriptomic analyses at 3, 6, and 9 months to investigate the molecular pathways underlying tau pathology in these olfactory regions. Due to the OE's peripheral location and anatomical accessibility, we also aimed in that respect to identify potential early biomarkers of tauopathy.

Increasing evidence implicates microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, as key modulators of RGC health and disease progression. However, the precise mechanisms by which microglia influence RGCs remain poorly understood, particularly in the human context. In this study, we established human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived co-culture systems incorporating microglia, astrocytes, and RGCs to explore how microglia shape RGC growth and maturation under physiological conditions. We first examined the impact of homeostatic microglia on RGCs in both co-culture and tri-culture systems, revealing distinct influences of cell types in co-culture compared to when they were grown individually. We then modeled inflammatory states by activating microglia with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and evaluated their effects on RGCs both directly and in the context of astrocyte co-culture. This stepwise, reductionist approach enabled us to dissect the cellular interactions driving RGC vulnerability in inflammatory conditions relevant to optic neuropathies. Our findings provide new insight into the complex neuroimmune landscape that underlies RGC degeneration and identify key pathways that may serve as therapeutic targets across a range of optic nerve diseases.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

The aim of the investigation was to uncover distinct connectivity signatures associated with each meditation style by examining the strength, frequency band, and direction of inter-regional information transfers. These differences were expected to highlight the neural grounds of the cognitive and affective state of each meditative practice. Multivariate Granger causality (GC) was computed from high-resolution EEG signals recorded from long-term meditators (n = 22) in four conditions: rest, FAM, OMM, and LKM. GC was analyzed in the frequency domain for key cortical regions (frontal and parietal) in the two hemispheres to compare frequency-specific directed connectivity between rest and each meditation type. Main results demonstrated that each meditation state produced highly specific alterations in information transfer relative to rest. In FAM, there was significant reduction in posterior-to-anterior GC in the alpha and beta bands, and decreased multi-spectral inter-hemispheric frontal GC pointing to attenuated bottom-up sensory and associative inputs. In OMM, multi-spectral GC was significantly increased from the left hemisphere to the right posterior cortex implying expanded awareness in the right posterior regions through enhanced top-down modulation by the left-hemisphere. The distinctive features of LKM profile were the inter-hemispheric symmetry, the posterior-anterior bi-directionality, and the specific beta-band engagement, implying a co-activation of systems that support an emotionally balanced stance, equanimity and pro-social attitude. These novel findings demonstrate that the direction and frequency specificity of information flows provide complementary insights into neural processes underlying distinct meditative states.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

We also developed a new, more robust method to quantify the degree of pre- and post-synaptic segregation and investigated this in the fly whole-brain. This revealed that many neurons have unsegregated synapses. We extracted highly unsegregated synapses and compared them with random-extracted null SC matrices. Their FC-SC correlation was significantly higher, indicating that these synapses contribute to FC well.

Much evidence supports the existence of specific, characterizable within-region dynamics in taste processing, but scant attention has been paid to dynamic inter-region interactions in taste processing. To fill this gap, we apply investigate simultaneous recordings from rodent Gustatory Cortex (GC) and Basolateral Amygdala (BLA), testing specific hypotheses about reciprocal amygdala-cortical interactions. We find that initially GC and BLA responses are independent, but evolve into synchronous, zero-lag ensemble transitions (surprising given the long axons connecting the two regions) within a few hundred milliseconds of taste delivery. Spectral Granger Causality (which infers directional influences) revealed that this tight synchrony also characterizes the system's asymmetric inter-region influences wherein the BLA[-&gt;]GC influence is dominant prior to the generation of the behavioral response and the GC[-&gt;]BLA influence becomes strong at the time that GC has been shown to release a behavior-relevant signal. To better understand the function of single neurons in this process, we then used Poisson Generalized Linear Modeling to categorize GC neurons in terms of their inferred connectivity. This analysis revealed that GC neurons that both influence and receive influence from BLA - the neurons most deeply embedded in the reciprocal circuit - are the ones most strongly involved in taste processing (quantified as taste-specificity and palatability-relatedness). These results, which are consistent with findings in multiple systems and species, support the notion that taste processing is a function of the amygdala-cortical loop.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

The resulting cognitive burden may affect the entire process if interpretation is not instantaneous. In this study, we investigated how numerical distance (ND), a measure of cognitive demand in numerical comparisons, influences movement initiation and inhibition. To this end, 32 participants completed a novel numerical comparison Stop-Signal Task (NC-SST), in which the cognitive demand of each trial was manipulated by varying the ND between pairs of numbers in both Go and Stop signals. Participants were required to initiate or stop a movement if an upcoming number was higher or smaller than the one presented previously. Results showed that larger NDs (i.e., easier comparisons) facilitated faster and more accurate responses during movement initiation and enhanced stopping performance. Using a generalized drift-diffusion model, we found that drift rates increased with ND and were modulated by the spatial location of numerical stimuli, consistent with a left-to-right space number association. A generalized linear mixed-effects model further revealed that Go process parameters, particularly the drift rate, strongly predicted successful stopping and interacted with Stop ND and Stop signal delay (SSD).

Here we measure fluctuations in neuronal activity and blood volume associated with the same events across the mouse brain, and find that their relationship is consistent across brain regions but differs in two opposing brainwide neural populations. Functional Ultrasound Imaging (fUSI) revealed that whisking, a marker of arousal, is associated with brainwide fluctuations in blood volume. Simultaneous fUSI and Neuropixels recordings in cortex and hippocampus showed that neurons that increase vs. decrease activity with whisking have distinct hemodynamic response functions. Brainwide Neuropixels recordings revealed that these two opposing populations are present in the entire brain. When summed, their contributions predicted blood volume across brain regions better than predictions from bulk neural activity. The mouse brain thus contains two neural populations with opposite relation to brain state and distinct relationships to blood supply, which together account for brainwide fluctuations in blood volume.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Current antiseizure medications may reduce seizure frequency, yet more targeted treatments are needed to address the epileptic and neurodevelopmental SLC13A5 phenotype.

Treatment benefits were achieved with administration during early brain development and in young adult mice, supporting a broad therapeutic window for this disorder. Comparison of delivery routes in young adult KO mice showed that higher brain targeting achieved with intra-cisterna magna delivery resulted in greater treatment benefit as compared to intrathecal lumbar puncture delivery.

LTP is thought to require CaMKII binding to the NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluN2B, but this poses a major conundrum: Truncated CaMKII monomers (without the hub domain that forms 12meric holoenzymes) fail to bind GluN2B, but still potentiate synapses when made constitutively active. We hypothesized that CaMKII monomer binding to GluN2B has just eluded detection. Instead, even though full-length CaMKII monomers (with hub domain mutations) were found to indeed bind and even co-condensate with GluN2B, truncated monomers were not. Nonetheless, truncated monomers still potentiated synapses, even in neurons with GluN2B mutations that ablate CaMKII binding. However, potentiation occurred only with monomers that were made Ca2+-independent by artificial phosphatase-resistant thio-autophosphorylation, not by regular autophosphorylation of T286. These findings support that CaMKII binding to GluN2B is required during physiological LTP induction because it generates the phosphatase-resistant autonomous activity that mediates LTP expression.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

POmAb is a prototypical Type-I antibody that specifically targets kringle-1 of prothrombin, maintaining it in an open state. In this study, we assess the effects of POmAb in mice using the cremaster arteriole laser-induced injury model. POmAb bound mouse prothrombin and decreased thrombin generation in mouse plasma. When administered intravenously shortly before the injury, POmAb quickly accumulated on the damaged vessel wall. This accumulation significantly reduced fibrin generation with a modest effect on platelet accumulation and without causing excessive bleeding. Results obtained with POmAb offer insights into the potential roles of the anti-prothrombin antibodies in APS.

Here, we demonstrate that UTY, a Y-linked homolog of the histone demethylase UTX, plays a critical, demethylase-independent role in maintaining pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Despite its low expression and weak enzymatic activity, UTY co-occupies active cis-regulatory elements with UTX and promotes the transcription of key pluripotency genes, including NODAL and LEFTY. Integrated genomic analyses of single and double knockout hESCs reveal that UTY and UTX function redundantly to maintain chromatin accessibility and ensure proper recruitment of core transcription factors such as OCT4 and SOX2. The combined loss of UTY and UTX disrupts transcription factor localization, induces widespread gene expression changes, and leads to a collapse of the pluripotent state, without detectable changes in H3K27 methylation. Instead, these defects are associated with impaired recruitment of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and reduced histone acetylation, suggesting a demethylase-independent mechanism. Our findings uncover an essential role for the evolutionarily conserved UTY in safeguarding enhancer function and transcription factor occupancy, highlighting Y-linked regulatory mechanisms that are critical for maintaining human pluripotency.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Exposure to AZ results in morphological perturbations in several species, including rats, frogs, and dogs; however, the mechanisms by which AZ has these effects is largely unexplored, and little is known about its effect on development. We have previously shown that AZ is teratogenic to sea urchin larvae, and that AZ was the only calcium-binding mineralization marker among five tested that perturbed skeletal patterning. Here, we further characterize these defects and demonstrate that embryos exposed to AZ have abnormal skeletal element rotation, branching, and bending. Immunostains and polychrome labeling reveal delayed migration of primary mesenchyme cells and initiation of biomineralization. Although gross ectodermal dorsal-ventral specification, ciliary band restriction, and neuronal specification occur normally in the majority of AZ-treated embryos, we find abnormal patterning and connectivity of the serotonergic neurons. Temporal transcriptomics comparisons confirm delayed development and implicate changes in neuron-related GO terms with AZ treatment. Particle imaging velocimetry experiments show that ciliary beating normally directs fluid flow into the larval mouth, while AZ treatment perturbs the normal pattern of vortices and redirects flow away from the mouth. These changes in fluid flow have functional consequences for larval feeding behaviors in AZ-treated embryos. Finally, we show that the effects of AZ on skeletal patterning are largely due to its inhibition of catalase and subsequent elevation of reactive oxygen species. Specifically, catalase knockdown and transient hydrogen peroxide treatment are each sufficient to phenocopy the hallmark AZ-mediated skeletal patterning defects. This study is the first to define the teratogenic consequences of AZ exposure and show how its effects on catalase activity impact development, skeletal patterning, and biomineralization.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

The model reveals a strong correlation between local negative electrostatic potential and Trp oxidation susceptibility. A simplified two- parameter model derived from these insights achieves 79% accuracy in classifying oxidation risk, compared to 84% accuracy with the full-feature classifier. Beyond our internal dataset, the two- parameter model successfully predicted oxidation risk for all CDR Trp sites in a blind subset of eight clinical-stage antibodies. In addition, we show that modulating the electrostatic potential around the Trp side-chains through distant charge-altering mutations can significantly reduce oxidation rates. In four out of five re-engineered antibodies, oxidation rates decreased by approximately 50%, while half of these maintained binding affinity.

However, little is known about the potential adverse effects of the constituents in these flavored products. Rationale and hypothesis: We hypothesized that exposure to common constituents in tobacco- and menthol-flavored ENDS constituents could elicit a lung-injurious response mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (-nAChR or CHRNA) modulation. Methods: Human bronchial epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, cells were treated with commonly used menthol and tobacco constituents on trans well inserts. Transepithelial barrier resistance (TEER) and millivolts (mV) across epithelial cells were measured over a 24-hour time. To assess the elicited inflammatory response, cytokines IL8 and IL6 were quantified in the conditioned media. Cytotoxicity caused by these constituents was evaluated by acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) staining of the cells after 24 hrs. alpha nicotinic receptor protein abundance (1, 4, 5, and 7) was quantified by immunoblotting. Results: Epithelial integrity was decreased over time with a significant decrease in TEER and voltage by ENDS constituents. A significant increase in IL6 in conditioned media was observed in PG/VG, carvone, and WS-23 treated cells. Carvone-treated cells also elicited significantly elevated IL8 in conditioned media. Further, increased 1, 4, 5, and 7 nAChR were seen in cells treated with PG/VG, Acetoin, Carvone, and WS-23. Conclusion: These findings suggested that common constituents in menthol- and tobacco-flavored ENDS induce lung inflammation, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and lung injury.

Microglial fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) signaling regulates many key microglial functions, and the CX3CR1-V249I single nucleotide polymorphism has been associated with increased risk for multiple neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, yet its functional consequences in human microglia remain unexplored. In this study, we generated iPSC-derived human microglia-like cells (hMGLs) and found that the CX3CR1-V249I variant increased susceptibility to starvation-induced cell death, reduced amyloid-beta uptake, altered microglial morphology, and impaired migration, with more pronounced effects in homozygous cells. Co-culture with neurons demonstrated that hMGLs with the CX3CR1-V249I variant misregulated neuronal properties, including abnormal neuronal growth as well as an induction of neuronal hyperexcitability. These findings highlight the critical role of CX3CR1 in regulating microglial function and implicate the V249I variant in driving pathogenic microglial states relevant to neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Studies exploring engram formation and reactivation have primarily used contextual conditioning in mice and made little distinction between engrams encoding contextual information versus cue-associated learning and recall. Furthermore, often missing in such analyses is exploration of sex differences in engram profiles. Using auditory fear conditioning and activity-dependent tagging in mice, we set out to disaggregate context-associated engrams from those associated with learning and recall while also profiling potential sex differences. Specifically, we quantified cellular activity during context exposure, fear recall, extinction training, and extinction recall in cortical and subthalamic brain regions supporting learning and memory. We found that male mice had larger ensembles of cells active in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL-PFC) during context exposure while female mice recalling a fear memory had a significantly greater proportion of cells that were active in the IL-PFC independent of context. Across sexes, we found greater reactivation of extinction engrams in the IL-PFC compared to contextual engrams. While we found ensembles and engrams in the prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL-PFC) and zona incerta (ZI), no sex differences were noted in these regions. These results not only emphasize that there is a distinction to be made between ensembles and engrams encoding contextual information from those encoding cue-associated learning and recall, but also highlight sex differences in ensemble and engrams allocation.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Given the wide variety of pathogens transmitted by ticks during hematophagy, there is an urgency to understand the neural mechanisms responsible for tick feeding behavior. We characterized three Ixodes signaling systems that are involved in feed-ing regulation in other arthropods: neuropeptide CCHamide (CCHa), short neuropeptide F (sNPF) and sulfakinin. RNAs encoding the preproneuropeptides and their re-ceptors were characterized and cDNAs for the receptors were expressed in HEK293T cells by transient transfection. Activation of the receptors by synthetic peptides was monitored by a calcium release (FLIPR) fluorescence assay. There was a single receptor (CCHaR) activated by CCHa (NH2-SCKMYGHSCLGGH-amide) containing a disulfide bond with an EC50=12 pM, while a scrambled cyclic peptide was inactive at 1 M. Of the two Ixodes NPY-like receptors, NPYLR1A was activated by sNPF (NH2-GGRSPSLRLRF-amide) with an EC50=1.9 nM. NPYLR1B did not respond to 10 M sNPF. A single sulfakinin receptor was activated by a sulfated sulfakinin (NH2-SDDY(SO3H)GHMRF-amide) with an EC50=220 pM but not by 1 M non-sulfated sulfakinin. The Ixodes GPCRs were able to couple to endogenous HEK293T G-protein(s). Surprisingly, human but not Ixodes GNAQ restored CCHaR responsiveness in HEK293T cells with GNAQ/GNA12 disruptions. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that all three receptors were expressed in the synganglion. CCHaR/CCHa were found at high levels in the midgut from unfed ticks, and CCHaR expression in the mid-gut was confirmed by RNAScope in situ hybridization.

Studies have indicated Wnt-3a, a member of the wingless type MMTV integration (Wnt) signalling cascade, may exert anti-inflammatory effects via canonical pathway activation and {beta}-catenin stabilisation. Furthermore, dysregulation of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway has been implicated in the degeneration of dopamine neurons in PD, however, stimulation of the canonical pathway via application of Wnt-3a to protect against inflammation and dopaminergic degeneration has not been explored. Methods: Primary microglial cultures were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 hours with or without Wnt-3a. TNF- levels were measured via ELISA while changes in NF{kappa}B inflammatory pathway proteins and phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated {beta}-catenin were analysed via capillary western blot. To assess Wnt pathway involvement, cultures were treated with DKK1 ({beta}-catenin canonical pathway inhibitor), SP600125 (Wnt/Pcp pathway inhibitor) or U73122 (Wnt/Ca2+ pathway inhibitor). Finally, C57BL/6 mice received continuous intracerebroventricular infusion of Wnt-3a via osmotic pumps to investigate the effects of Wnt-3a on dopaminergic neuron survival and on microglial numbers in the MPTP model of PD. Results: Wnt-3a alone had no effect on TNF- release from microglia. However, when co-administered with LPS, there was a significant increase in cytokine release beyond that seen with LPS alone. Protein analysis revealed that this exacerbation in TNF- levels was not due to alterations in the NF{kappa}B pathway or differences in activation of {beta}-catenin. Furthermore, DKK1 treated cells showed no changes in TNF-, however both SP600125 and U723122 were able to block Wnt-3a + LPS induced TNF- release, implicating the non-canonical pathways. Meanwhile Wnt-3a in vivo did not alter dopaminergic or microglial populations in the substantia nigra in MPTP lesioned animals. Conclusion: Together, these results suggest a pro-inflammatory response to Wnt-3a in an inflammatory context with little or no effect on resting microglia. Importantly, this outcome was independent of the {beta}-catenin canonical pathway, revealing that Wnt-3a can increase pro-inflammatory TNF- release via non-canonical signaling in an inflammatory environment.

We found that neural variability in mouse primary visual cortex observe a simple rule: For a given sensory stimulus, the mean and the variance of spike counts follow a linear relationship across neurons. To understand how this neural variability structure affects the sensory representation, we artificially varied the slope of the log-mean and log-variance relationship. We found that the intrinsic structure of neural variability allows representations of distinct sensory information to be continuous while minimizing overlap, enabling the neural code to be roust while still being efficient. Further, representational similarity was maximally consistent between different sets of neurons at slope 1, both within and across mice. Thus, the neural variability structure may enable the neocortex to build robust representations of the sensory world, both within and across individuals.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

While brief bursts of stimulation are known to heterogeneously modulate neuronal spiking, it is unclear how trains of high frequency pulses influence neural dynamics. Objective: As fast spiking interneurons (FSIs) can support rapid firing, we seek to determine how high frequency stimulation modulates FSIs. Methods: We characterized the real-time effect of one-second-long local stimulation at 40 versus 140 Hz on parvalbumin positive interneurons, known as FSIs, in motor and visual cortices in awake mice using near kilohertz voltage imaging, free of electrical stimulation artifact. Results: Stimulation at 140 Hz, like 40 Hz, heterogeneously modulates individual FSIs membrane voltage in both cortices, leading to complex temporal dynamics. FSIs in both cortices are robustly entrained by 40 Hz stimulation, even though 40 Hz led to prominent membrane hyperpolarization in visual cortex but not motor cortex. Intriguingly, visual cortical FSIs, but not motor cortical ones, were reliably entrained by 140 Hz stimulation. Finally, while stimulation consistently reduced the response amplitude of visual cortical FSIs to visual flickers, response temporal precision is bidirectionally modulated. Conclusion: High frequency electrical stimulation mediates brain-region specific entrainment of FSIs, and bidirectionally modulates FSI temporal processing of synaptic inputs. Thus, high frequency stimulation can differentially engage inhibitory neurons in different brain regions to modulate network information processing.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

The diversity of effects that locomotion exerts on sensory neurons, as well as disparities between species, raises questions about the existence of universal principles that may underlie sensation during behavior. We propose that sensory systems are modulated in anticipation of systematic changes in stimulus statistics caused by locomotion to maintain an accurate and efficient sensory code across behavioral states. Model neurons optimized to encode stimuli recorded during movement in natural environments predict and reproduce a broad spectrum of experimental observations. The proposed, simple principle of anticipatory modulation reconciles the diversity of ways in which locomotion modulates visual coding in different animal species.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Despite their abruptness, these saccades usually go unnoticed, creating the seamless experience of smooth tracking. We conducted three experiments to examine awareness and control of catch-up saccades (Experiment 1), the effect of training (Experiment 2), and of movement intention (Experiment 3). All experiments followed a similar protocol. On each trial, a target moved horizontally at one of three constant speeds (3-12 dva/s). Two horizontal stimulus bands with vertically oriented gratings appeared above and below the trajectory. These bands were rendered invisible during pursuit by rapid phase shifts (>60 Hz), but became visible when briefly stabilized on the retina--either by a catch-up saccade or its replayed retinal consequence--providing immediate, saccade-contingent visual feedback. Observers reported whether they had seen the stimulus bands (visual sensitivity) and whether they were aware of making a catch-up saccade (saccade sensitivity). Visual sensitivity was consistently higher in trials with a catch-up saccade, confirming that these movements reduce retinal motion and enhance visibility. Higher target speeds increased saccade rate, but observers struggled to control them consciously: Visual feedback and training had no effect on the ability to control catch-up saccades. Only suppression-instructions yielded a small reduction. Saccade sensitivity was near zero, even in trials with saccade-contingent feedback. Neither training nor intention improved awareness. Together, our data suggest a limited ability to control and a low level of sensorimotor awareness of catch-up saccades during pursuit.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

This depolarization effect is highly dependent on the balance between the chloride co-transporters NKCC1 and KCC2. It is not known how changes in NKCC1 modulate the fate of Nestin-positive stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampus during adult neurogenesis. In our study, we demonstrate that a knockout of Nkcc1 in NSCs increase their proliferation by symmetric self-renewal and expand the stem cell pool. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified Sox11 as a key transcription factor that is significantly downregulated following Nkcc1 knockout. In agreement with this finding, we found that Sox11 knockout enhances proliferation and self-renewal of NSCs, which is also marked by an increase in symmetric stem cell division. Based on these findings, we propose that altering Nkcc1 expression in NSCs shifts their fate from neurogenesis towards self-renewal via Sox11 regulation. Furthermore, we observed that NKCC1 levels decline in NSCs during aging, which correlates with a further increase in self-renewal. Our data strongly suggest that the age-related decline in NKCC1 levels promote symmetric division and self-renewal contributing to the age-dependent decrease in neurogenesis. NKCC1 via Sox11 is a key regulator of NSCs fate decision, critically balancing self-renewal and neuronal differentiation in the adult hippocampus.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Prior studies have demonstrated primacy and recency effects in tasks requiring the serial recall of visual stimuli such as letters, digits, words, or locations. However, there is still ongoing debate about whether these primacy/recency effects on working memory retrieval reflect variable representational precision for multiple items in memory or misbinding of item features (e.g., location) and their ordinal position. This study sought to examine potential sources contributing to serial-position effects in visuospatial working memory using eye tracking and statistical modeling approaches. In two eye-tracking experiments, we measured the latency and endpoint error of serial-order memory-guided saccades under varying cue conditions (order cue vs. quadrant cue) from a total of 92 participants. The first memory-guided saccade (MGS) showed primacy and recency effects on endpoint error, latency, and transposition error in the order cue condition but not in the quadrant cue condition. Probabilistic modeling of MGS distribution showed a better fit of a standard (non-swapping) model to the quadrant-cue condition and a swap model to the order-cue condition. These findings indicate that visuospatial working memory representation varies across serial positions primarily due to location-serial-position misbinding rather than variable memory precision about location.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) studies of aSyn fibrils with ligands often reveal binding at multiple sites, likely due to high ligand concentrations. Here, various structural and chemical biology techniques were used to characterize aSyn fibrils in the presence of EX-6, a candidate ligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of synucleinopathies. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cryo-EM revealed no significant fibril core changes upon binding.

However, the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear, with ongoing debate on peripheral versus central contributions. Objectives: This experimental study aimed to differentiate first and second pain perception during the OA paradigm, thereby assessing fiber-specific influences on OA. Methods: Thirty-two healthy participants were asked to distinguish a double pain sensation (first and second pain), to assess pain quality descriptors related to A-delta; and C-fibers, and to indicate response times to brief noxious heat stimuli. This procedure was repeated while implementing heat pulses in an OA paradigm. Results: No significant differences were found between offset and constant trials in the reported double pain sensation or the fiber specific pain descriptors (p > 0.05). Nevertheless, significant differences in response times were observed depending on the type of trial and the timing of the stimulus. Response time to noxious stimuli was delayed after prolonged stimulation in both offset and constant trials (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The findings suggest that A-delta and C-fiber response characteristics were unaffected during the OA paradigm; however, higher stimulation intensities or prolonged pain induce a notable response delay. This indicates a negligible role of specific peripheral nerve fibers in OA, emphasizing the predominance of central mechanisms, particularly those related to attention and cognitive resources, which merit further investigation.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

OLs exhibit regional heterogeneity, especially in their ability to synthesize cholesterol, a critical driver of myelin wrapping and ensheathment of axons. Conditional depletion of the Fused in sarcoma (Fus) gene in OLs, referred to as FusOLcKO, increases cholesterol biosynthesis, myelin thickness, and tissue cholesterol content. We examine whether this hypermyelination alters extracellular recordings across the layers of visual cortex and the underlying hippocampal CA1 over 16 weeks. In FusOLcKO mice, visually-evoked single-unit detectability and firing rate in CA1 increased relative to wild-type littermates, whereas cortical recordings showed no improvement. At the population level, FusOLcKO cortex exhibited reduced firing rates and lower functional connectivity, indicating altered network dynamics. Post-mortem histology revealed higher neuron density in recorded cortex and greater excitatory synapse density in CA1 of FusOLcKO mice suggesting region-specific neuroprotection and synaptic strengthening. These results demonstrate that cholesterol-driven hypermyelination enhances chronic hippocampal recordings while disrupting cortical network communication.

Nevertheless, most paradigms rely on vision or touch, relegating hearing to a supporting role and leaving auditory-only contributions unclear. Here, we tested whether affective content and individual traits modulate motor planning for looming sounds that stop within PPS. Thirty-three adults completed three auditory-only tasks in which positive, negative, or neutral sounds halted at five simulated distances from the participant's ears (0.3-0.7 m). We recorded anticipatory postural adjustments, distance estimates, affective ratings, and sensory suggestibility via a questionnaire.

Here, we develop a transformer neural network model [2, 3] trained on neuronal spikes from intracranial microelectrodes recorded during a single viewing of an audiovisual episode. Combining spikes throughout the brain via cross-channel attention [4], capable of discovering neural patterns spread across brain regions and timescales, individual participant models predict memory retrieval of specific concepts such as persons or places. Brain regions differentially contribute to memory decoding before and after sleep. Models trained using only medial temporal lobe (MTL) spikes significantly decode concepts before but not after sleep, while models trained using only frontal cortex (FC) spikes decode concepts after but not before sleep. These findings suggest a system-wide distribution of information across neural populations that transforms over wake/sleep cycles [5]. Such decoding of internally generated memories suggests a path towards brain-computer interfaces to treat episodic memory disorders through enhancement or muting of specific memories.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

While previous studies have focused on resting-state activity and passive listening, less is known about frequency-specific brain dynamics during event-related tasks that require active memory engagement. In this study, we extend the recently developed FREQ-NESS analytical pipeline by adapting it to event-related task and resting state source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 70 healthy participants. This method quantified the variance explained by frequency-specific brain networks, their spatial organization, and associated time-resolved power estimates. We found significant effects of age, condition, and their interaction in the variance explained by leading components at 1.07 Hz, 2.86 Hz, and 10.00 Hz. Younger adults exhibited stronger peaks at 1.07 and 2.86 Hz during the task and a more pronounced 10.00 Hz peak at rest, whereas older adults showed the opposite pattern. Time-frequency analysis revealed age- and condition-dependent desynchronization in the alpha and beta bands (7.10-22.90 Hz).

Participants either received error-based feedback about their endpoint or reinforcement feedback about the resulting reward. We additionally manipulated the feedback schedule to assess the role of feedback frequency and whether feedback focusses on individual trials or a group of trials. Participants with trial-by-trial reinforcement feedback performed best and had the least endpoint deviation from optimality. Our results are consistent with a slow gradual drift in the participants' internal aiming location under summary feedback.

To date, the EBG has been used to assess how the OB process odor identity, valence, intensity, and it has shown promise as an early biomarker for Parkinson's disease. However, current implementation of the EBG method depends on several methodological components, including subject specific co-registration of electrode positions through neuronavigation and EEG source reconstruction, which may limit accessibility for many research groups. In this study, we test the quality and reliability of the OB signal under different configurations to potentially remedy this. Specifically, we compare six EBG setups that vary in the use of subject-specific T1 scans versus a template head model, co-registered versus template electrode positions, and individualized versus template-based OB location. Our results indicate that strongest EBG signals are obtained when using subject-specific T1 scans in combination with co-registered electrode positions. However, we obtained significant EBG activity even when using a fully template-based configuration. Our anatomical analysis of OB location of 941 individuals reveals that in 86% of cases, the OB is centered within the spatial resolution bounds of the EEG source dipole, supporting the feasibility of detecting olfactory bulb signals without precise individual anatomical mapping using template coordinates. These findings suggest that while subject-specific configurations enhance signal quality, the EBG method remains robust enough to yield meaningful results even with less complex setups. This enables a broader adoption of the EBG method in both clinical and research settings.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that ALPK1 activation enhances multiple outputs of the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway, including both canonical and noncanonical responses such as STING proton channel dependent LC3B lipidation and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, ALPK1 signaling activates eIF2, an effector of the integrated stress response.

Clinically, individuals with ALPK1-mediated disease exhibit premature intracranial mineralization and elevated cerebrospinal fluid neopterin, both associated with dysregulated interferon signaling. These findings support a model of bidirectional signaling between ALPK1 and STING, in which microbial and nucleic acid sensing pathways can amplify one another.

Remarkably, these intestinal Tr1 cells emerge at the time of weaning and accumulate independently of the microbiota displaying similar abundance, function and TCR repertoire under germ-free conditions. Instead, the small intestinal T-bet+ Tr1 program is driven and shaped by dietary antigens, and accumulates in a cDC1-IL-27 dependent manner. Upon activation, these cells robustly express IL-10 and multiple inhibitory receptors, establishing a distinct suppressive profile.

Interestingly, in a ccpA mutant lacking the global regulator of carbon catabolism, Pho regulon genes are hyper-induced in a PhoR-independent, glucose-dependent manner. While CcpA is known to directly repress the phoP promoter, we now show that overexpression of a phosphorylatable form of PhoP is essential for this hyper-induction. Remarkably, we detected early PhoP phosphorylation in the ccpA phoR double mutant. PhosTag-based analysis revealed that the phosphorylated/unphosphorylated PhoP ratio, rather than absolute levels, is the critical determinant of Pho regulon activation under these conditions. Given that PhoR can phosphorylate non-cognate YycF, the response regulator of the essential YycFG system controlling cell wall metabolism. We hypothesized that PhoP phosphorylation in the absence of PhoR may be mediated by YycG. Supporting this, PhoP co-immunoprecipitated with YycG, and in vitro phosphorylation assays confirmed direct phosphorylation of PhoP by YycG. We propose a Pi-stress regulatory model in which CcpA prevents excessive PhoP accumulation, thereby maintaining an appropriate balance between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated PhoP. This regulatory balance prevents aberrant PhoP activation via non-cognate kinases such as YycG in the absence of PhoR.

However, experimental evidence that quantifies the impact of HWs on insects in their ecological context is limited. Here, we measured across multiple biological scales (e.g. fitness, physiology, transcriptomic and microbiota) the stage-specific responses of the arboviral vector Aedes albopictus when experiencing an ecologically relevant HW. In arboviral vectors, only females require a blood-meal thus contributing to the transmission cycle, but males, eggs and larvae can also be the target of control strategies to reduce population size. As such the understanding of the responses to a HW during mosquito development has both biological and epidemiological relevance. We observed stage-specific responses, starting at the egg stage. We saw egg hatching decreasing and delaying after HW exposure. On the contrary, larvae showed to be resilient to HW. Larvae repurposed their energy resulting in trivial mortality, but delayed development. At the adult stage, we observed a marked sex difference, with extensive (>50%) male mortality, accompanied by a small (16) number of genes elicited following HW exposure, which indicates that males have limited coping mechanisms against hot events. In females, we observed a reduced reproductive output, but only when HW occurred after a blood-meal. Finally, we saw extensive HW-dependent changes in the microbial composition of larvae, but female microbiota remained dominated by Wolbachia regardless of the thermal challenge.

However, many other physical, chemical, and biological processes decouple dissolved O2 and CO2 concentrations in lakes. Tracking departures from 1:-1 stoichiometry may provide insights into larger scale ecosystem functioning, particularly during fall when temperatures change and destratification occurs. Using continuous measures of both dissolved O2 and CO2 in a small temperate headwater lake, we looked at the interannual gas departure signals during fall over seven years. The beginning of fall, defined here as the start of leaf colour change, differed among years but coincided well with the onset of lake destratification and a shift in surface gas concentrations. Fall surface CO2 accumulation rates varied considerably, whereas O2 depletion rates were rather similar among years. Departure signals were broadly related to interannual differences in climate: more CO2 accumulated in the surface during the hottest-wettest fall compared to the coldest-driest one (0.81 and 0.37 mol L-1 d-1, respectively), presumably from more catchment than hypolimnetic inputs. Lower CO2 accumulation occurred during years with prolonged hypolimnetic hypoxia potentially through enhanced CO2 consumption by methanogenesis. Other internal biological phenomena influenced fall departure signals, including a large metalimnetic oxygen peak, and higher fall surface primary production. We suggest gas departures during fall provide an integrative metabolic fingerprint for temperate stratified lakes, as well as insights into winter-priming conditions.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

While it is in principle possible to estimate this effect from genome sequence data, interactions between selection, demography and inbreeding are expected to make inference less reliable. Here we investigate whether the genome-wide reduction in diversity due to background selection (B) can be accurately estimated when populations are at demographic non-equilibrium and/or reproduce by partial self-fertilisation. We show that the classic-BGS model is surprisingly robust to both demographic non-equilibrium and low rates of selfing, although both processes do lead to biased estimation of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of deleterious mutations. A high rate of selfing leads to poor estimation of both B and DFE parameters. We propose an alternative inference approach where background selection, demography and partial selfing are jointly estimated from windowed site frequency spectra. This approach, while approximate in nature, resolves most of the bias observed under the classic-BGS model and can also generate estimates of past demography that account for the effect of background selection and partial selfing. We apply the approach to genome sequence data from Capsella grandiflora and C. orientalis, which have contrasting mating systems and display a forty-fold difference in nucleotide diversity. Our results suggest that background selection has a weak effect on levels of genetic diversity in the outcrosser C. grandiflora (B=0.89) and a more substantial effect in the predominantly selfing species C. orientalis (B=0.44), but that background selection alone cannot explain their disparity in genetic diversity.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Understanding the temporal and spatial dynamics of resistance evolution in this context is critical for preserving the effectiveness of public health interventions. We conducted longitudinal sampling of Ae. albopictus populations in Wake County, North Carolina, from 2016 to 2024. Using a novel allele-specific PCR melt curve assay, we genotyped 2,273 mosquitoes at the F1534S locus in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene. Resistance allele frequencies were calculated annually and mapped across the county for three key years, 2016, 2018, and 2023, representing the pre-emergence, initial detection, and widespread phases of resistance development. Selection and dominance were estimated using the Wright-Fisher Approximate Bayesian Computation algorithm for locus F1534S. The F1534S resistance allele was first detected in 2018 at a central, affluent neighborhood. By 2023, the allele had spread throughout the sampling region, with the highest frequencies near the site of first detection. Resistance allele frequency peaked at 0.36 in 2023, accompanied by an increase in heterozygous and homozygous resistance genotypes. Temporally sampled sites showed consistent trends in rising resistance, with all temporally-sampled locations harboring resistance genotypes by 2022. The resistance allele was found to be under high selection pressure and partially recessive in this population. Our findings reveal rapid emergence and spatial expansion of the F1534S kdr allele in Ae. albopictus populations in a suburban setting.

P.", "abstract": "Many nascent breeding programs aim to achieve genetic gain by crossing locally elite germplasm, but a lack of systematic approaches to develop elite gene pools from locally-adapted varieties hinders their progress. Motivated by the observation of undesirable transgressive segregation in presumed elite crosses in Senegalese cereal breeding programs, we designed approaches for de novo development of elite gene pools from locally-adapted landrace-derived germplasm. We first define two types of 'elite' germplasm: cis-elite, phenotypically similar and genetically homogeneous for locally-adapted traits ('acquired traits'); versus trans-elite, phenotypically similar, but genetically heterogeneous for acquired traits. Next, we defined two genomic approaches for de novo inference of elite gene pools: population-based genotypic inference (PGI) and QTL-based genotypic inference (QGI), and compared to a family-based phenotypic inference (FPI) approach. Using simulations that trace the evolution from locally-adapted landraces to elite breeding lines, we evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies in nascent forward breeding programs. QGI accurately and cost-effectively identifies both cis- and trans-elite pairs, regardless of the underlying trait architecture, while PGI is less sensitive when trait architecture is oligogenic. Over ten cycles of phenotypic recurrent selection, programs based on cis-elite crosses consistently outperformed those based on trans-elite crosses for genetic gain. The findings highlight the value of trait genetic architecture knowledge for elite gene pool development and provide a practical roadmap for elite germplasm development in modernizing breeding programs.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Their respective vascular manifestations are opposed, resulting in thoracic aortic aneurysm in MFS and supravalvular aortic stenosis in WBS. To investigate the interdependence of both essential molecular constituents of elastic fibers, we have generated a double heterozygous mouse model by crossing an MFS female (Fbn1C1041G/+) with a Complete Deletion (CD)-WBS male. We evaluated blood pressure, cardiac and aortic phenotypes, and some physical and cognitive functions in the offspring. Double heterozygous mice (CDMFS) presented the characteristic CD altered behavior. CDMFS mice developed an aneurysm, which progressed over age indistinguishably from MFS mice; CDMFS aortic wall showed a thicker tunica media aorta layer and thinner elastic fibers in accordance with CD mice. The characteristic MFS reduction in vascular smooth muscle cell density is not observed in the CDMFS aorta. CDMFS mice develop the high blood pressure observed in CD animals which does not occur in MFS. Ejection fraction was significantly reduced in MFS, CD, and CDMFS mice compared with WT littermates. Cardiac redox stress markers increased only in CD mice, but not in CDMFS animals. Metalloproteinase-2 protein levels increased only in MFS hearts and partially reduced in CDMFS ones.

To facilitate genetic research in India, a crucial first step is to create a foundational resource that serves as a benchmark for future population studies and methods development. To this end, we have constructed the largest and most nationally representative linkage disequilibrium and genotype imputation reference panels in India to date, using high-coverage whole-genome sequencing data of 2,680 Indian participants from the Longitudinal Aging Study in India-Harmonized Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia (LASI-DAD).

Besides serving as an LD lookup panel, LASI-DAD facilitates various statistical analyses that rely on precise LD estimates. In a polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis, LASI-DAD improved the predictive performance of PRS by 2.1% to 35.1% across traits and studies.

The disease is clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with over 125 disease-causing genes identified to date. Here, genetic studies in ten patients from 5 unrelated families of diverse ethnic background, led to the identification of KCTD11 as a novel CMT gene, responsible for a new autosomal recessive intermediate CMT subtype, RI-CMTE. The variants identified are loss of function. KCTD11 encodes KCTD11/REN, a protein of yet unknown function in the Peripheral Nervous System, known to regulate HDAC1, beta-catenin, and mTORC1, key regulators of myelination and neuronal differentiation in the PNS. To explore the role of KCTD11 in the PNS, we used a constitutive Kctd11-/- mouse model and the derived in vitro myelin model of sensory neuron and Schwann cell co-culture (DRGN/SC), to mimic the loss-of-function induced by patient mutations. We first demonstrate that the loss of KCTD11 is due to enhanced degradation of the mutated protein via autophagy. Both in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrate abnormal myelination in vivo and altered myelination dynamics in vitro. These defects were associated with dysregulation of the expression of key transcription factors in Schwann cells, such as Egr2 and Sox10, along with other myelin-related genes, as revealed by mRNA-sequencing data. Regarding pathophysiological mechanisms, we identified dysregulation of HDAC1 expression, as well as alterations in the Wnt/beta-catenin, Sonic Hedgehog and Hippo/YAP signaling pathways. The deregulation of these pathways seem to converge to altered autophagy and altered balance between proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, at least in Schwann cells. These mechanisms remain to be explored in axons from PNS neurons. Altogether, our results identify KCTD11 as a novel gene defective in autosomal recessive intermediate RI-CMTE and highlight the key role of KCTD11 in maintaining myelin homeostasis through regulation of HDAC1 and phosphorylated beta-catenin levels, thereby preventing late-onset myelin abnormalities and degradation.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Core collections provide a strategic approach to reducing population size while retaining genetic diversity and allele frequencies, serving as key resources for genetic research. Although various sampling and selection strategies have been proposed, most of them focused on either diversity or representativeness, rarely both, and none fully integrated these with QTL detection optimization. The first part of our study focuses on a genetic diversity analysis of a flax germplasm (Linum usitatissimum L.), a prerequisite for the development of core collections. This germplasm, maintained by the Arvalis Institute, is a worldwide flax collection comprising 1,593 accessions originating from 42 countries, encompassing all major flax-growing regions. It includes both spring- and winter-type lines, as well as oilseed and fiber types. The results revealed a pronounced genetic structure within the germplasm, strongly influenced by cultivation purposes (fiber vs. oilseed flax), growth cycle (winter vs. spring), and geographic origin. A K-means clustering procedure identified six clusters as the optimal structuration, which aligns with our knowledge of this germplasm. Overall genetic diversity was moderate (H = 0.22), with oilseed flax clusters displaying greater diversity than fiber flax, likely due to the broader selection history and wider geographic distribution, findings consistent with previous studies. In a second step we evaluated twenty distinct strategies for core-collection development. Some approaches were originally developed for core-collection construction while others were developed for optimizing genomic-selection calibration panels. QTL detection performance was assessed via extensive simulations of QTLs distributed across the genome. We observed a fundamental trade-off between maximizing diversity and ensuring representativeness in core collection design. Diversity-oriented approaches may overemphasize rare or outlier genotypes, compromising representativeness, while representativeness-focused strategies leaded to overlooking rare alleles, thus limiting diversity. In our results we have found that particular combinations of selection criteria achieved a favorable balance between genetic diversity and representativeness, while concurrently maintaining a robust capacity to capture QTL signals across the genome. We demonstrated that using the Shannon index combined with the allelic coverage led to optimal core-collection design adapted for GWAS applications in a structured population. These results provide knowledge for the development of optimized core collections tailored to GWAS applications.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify IBD1 as a critical adaptor that bridges histone acetylation and SWR-mediated H2A.Z deposition. We demonstrate that the bromodomain of IBD1 recognizes histone acetylation, specifically H3K9/14 di-acetylation to recruit the SWR complex subunit ARP6, ensuring precise H2A.Z incorporation into chromatin. Genetic disruption of IBD1, either by deletion or bromodomain mutation, attenuates H2A.Z occupancy at target loci, confirming its essential role in H2A.Z deposition. Strikingly, perturbation of the histone acetylation-IBD1-H2A.Z axis triggers transcriptional hyperactivation, revealing a dual function of H2A.Z in sustaining basal transcription while preventing aberrant gene induction. This defines a novel regulatory paradigm in which IBD1 couples acetyl-mark decoding to SWR-dependent H2A.Z deposition, establishing transcriptional homeostasis. Our findings resolve a central ambiguity by demonstrating that H2A.Z acts as a repressive buffer in highly acetylated regions, counterbalancing the inherent activation potential of acetylation. This study provides a framework for investigating H2A.Z functions and reveals new perspectives on how chromatin modifications and histone variants interplay in transcriptional regulation.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Both approaches can fail when mean within-group distance is similar across groups but the distribution of the within-group distances are different. This is a pertinent question in high dimensional microbiome data, where outliers and overdispersion can distort the performance of a mean-dissimilarity-based test. We introduce the non-parametric Distance based Test for Homogeneity (DTH) which measures dissimilarity between groups by comparing the empirical distribution of within-group dissimilarities using a combination of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wasserstein distances. For more than two groups, pairwise group tests are combined using a permutation-based p-value.

Under this model, genetic incompatibilities emerge when mitochondrial haplotypes are placed into a cellular context without their coevolved nuclear-encoded mitochondrial (n-mt) proteins.

Does disrupting co-adapted mitonuclear genotypes have broad, genome-wide effects with numerous n-mt loci contributing to reproductive isolation? We leverage a system with several hybridizing species pairs (Xiphophorus fishes) that have known mitonuclear incompatibilities of large effect to ask whether a general signal of incompatibility is present when considering all n-mt genes. After dividing nuclear-encoded proteins into three classes based on level of interaction with mitochondrial gene products, we found only inconsistent statistical evidence for a difference between these classes in the degree of conserved mitonuclear ancestry.

In this study, we addressed this knowledge gap by examining silencing efficacy in siRNA-treated cells that undergo cryopreservation.

Since the brain lesion cannot be cured, treatment aims at improving mobility. Multilevel surgery targets muscle and bony impairments but the outcome of multilevel surgery is variable and unpredictable due to our limited insight in the contribution of musculoskeletal impairments to gait alterations. Methods: Here, we used predictive simulations based on personalized musculoskeletal models to identify the contribution of musculoskeletal impairments to altered gait in eight individuals with CP scheduled for multilevel surgery. For each individual, we generated gait patterns based on eight models with different levels of personalization. We modeled muscle weakness, muscle contractures, and/or bony deformities of hip and knee and evaluated the contribution of these impairments to deviations in kinematics by comparing simulated and experimental kinematics. Results: The contribution of musculoskeletal impairments varied largely between participants. All modeled musculoskeletal impairments explained little to 39% of the kinematic deficits, in line with the limited and variable effect of multilevel surgery. Muscle contractures had the largest effect on the predicted kinematics.

Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective treatment to suppress symptoms of PD and is known to suppress pathological beta activity. However, the mechanism underlying this effect is not completely understood. Here, we tested the circuital effects of DBS in a computational model of the basal ganglia network in dopamine-depleted condition mimicking PD. Our model reproduces suppression of beta pathological oscillations in the basal ganglia network induced by subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS. Crucially, this occurs for realistic levels of DBS intensity only if we incorporate short-term plasticity in STN projections to their downstream targets. STN stimulation hampers beta oscillations in the subthalamo-pallidal beta loop. This induces a progressive dephasing between this loop and the striato-pallidal beta loop, which leads in turn to a network-wide suppression of beta oscillations. This is also reflected in a restoration of the balance between D1 and D2 firing rates, which was altered by dopamine depletion. Moreover, the model also reproduces the DBS-induced gamma activity associated with symptom recovery. Finally, we explored the circuital effects of a broad range of DBS parameters in suppressing beta oscillations, focusing on the clinically relevant range of 60-150 Hz stimulation. The model suggests that 60-80 Hz stimulation frequencies might achieve beta desynchronization for an intensity even lower than the one needed at the standard 130 Hz frequency.

The choice of format may have important implications for the cost, speed and simplicity of nanopore signal data analysis, management and storage. To inform this choice, we present a comparative evaluation of POD5 vs SLOW5. We conducted benchmarking experiments assessing file size, analysis performance and usability on a variety of different computer architectures. SLOW5 showed superior performance during sequential and non-sequential (random access) file reading on most systems, manifesting in faster, cheaper basecalling and other analysis, and we could find no instance in which POD5 file reading was significantly faster than SLOW5.

A.; Borbon-Garcia, A.; Ley, R. E.; Tyakht, A. V.", "abstract": "Flagellin is the protein monomer of the bacterial flagellum, which confers motility, allowing bacteria to reach their favored niches. Flagellin is highly conserved across bacterial species and thus the target of the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5). In the gut, bacterial flagellin agonizes human TLR5, triggering a pro-inflammatory response. However, the ability to bind and activate TLR5 varies considerably between different flagellins, suggesting that the composition of an individual's flagellin repertoire - the flagellome - may mediate the inflammatory response to the microbiome, with relevance to inflammatory bowel diseases. However, to date, methods to assess the inflammatory potential of a flagellome are lacking. To address this gap, we constructed a curated database of human gut flagellins. To predict the inflammatory potential of the flagellome by sorting flagellins into either \"stimulatory\" (strong TLR5 agonists) or \"silent\" (weak TLR5 agonists), we trained a machine learning model on experimentally characterized flagellins with known binding and stimulatory activities. The FlaPro pipeline was implemented using the Snakemake workflow engine for high-throughput analysis and is available at https://github.com/leylabmpi/FlaPro. To validate our approach and explore clinical associations, we applied FlaPro to a publicly available multi-omics dataset from an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort. Our analysis demonstrates that FlaPro enables robust profiling of the human gut flagellome from metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data. Analysis of the IBD datasets revealed a depletion of flagellome diversity and a reduced silent-to-stimulatory flagellin abundance ratio in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, observed at both the genomic and transcriptional levels. Multiple condition-specific alterations were identified at the level of individual flagellin clusters. These findings indicate that IBD is associated with distinct alterations in the gut flagellome, particularly in relation to TLR5 recognition.

This gap hampers the identification of native-like folds in computational predictions, particularly as AI-driven methods become increasingly prevalent. Results: This paper presents RNAtive, the first computational tool to apply consensus-derived secondary structures for reference-free evaluation of RNA 3D models. It aggregates recurrent base-pairing and stacking interactions across ensembles of predicted 3D structures to construct a consensus secondary structure. Models are then ranked using two metrics derived from binary classification.

Currently, calculations are limited to single-material systems that are either all-RNA or all-DNA. Here, to enable analysis of mixed-material systems that are critical for modern applications in vitro, in situ, and in vivo, we develop physical models and dynamic programming algorithms that allow the material of the system to be specified at nucleotide resolution. Free energy parameter sets are constructed for both RNA/DNA and RNA/2'OMe-RNA mixed-material systems by combining available empirical mixed-material parameters with single-material parameter sets to enable treatment of the full complex and test tube ensembles. New dynamic programming recursions account for the material of each nucleotide throughout the recursive process. For a complex with N nucleotides, the mixed-material dynamic programming algorithms maintain the O(N3) time complexity of the single-material algorithms, enabling efficient calculation of diverse physical quantities over complex and test tube ensembles (e.g., complex partition function, equilibrium complex concentrations, equilibrium base-pairing probabilities, minimum free energy secondary structure(s), and Boltzmann-sampled secondary structures) at a cost increase of roughly 2.0-3.5x. The results of existing single-material algorithms are exactly reproduced when applying the new mixed-material algorithms to single-material systems. Accuracy is significantly enhanced using mixed-material models and algorithms to predict RNA/DNA and RNA/2'OMe-RNA duplex melting temperatures from the experimental literature as well as RNA/DNA melt profiles from new experiments.

Especially static gene sets used in enrichment analyses and the lack of single-gene resolution in such analyses restrains the flexible association of genes with specific context. Here, we introduce CENTRA (Centrality-based Exploration of Network Topologies from Regulatory Assemblies), a framework that models gene contextuality through topic-specific gene co-occurrence networks derived from curated gene sets and associated literature. Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation on 12,045 abstracts linked to MSigDB C2 gene sets, we uncovered 27 biological topics and constructed corresponding topic-specific networks that reflect distinct biological states, perturbation conditions, and disease-related regulatory programs. Graph-topological metrics, including centrality, local fractality, and perturbation sensitivity, were computed for each gene to capture structural relevance within these topic-specific contexts. We demonstrate that topological profiles distinguish well-characterized regulators, identify emerging functional candidates, and reveal context-specific roles. Thereby, our framework enables the prioritization of understudied genes by assessing the robustness of their topological signatures across topic-specific networks. To support exploration of these results, we developed a publicly accessible interactive browser application, CENTRA, which enables dynamic navigation of networks and their functional annotations. CENTRA provides an interpretable, scalable framework for investigating context-dependent gene function and hypothesis generation, offering a novel entry point beyond traditional enrichment approaches.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Both DNA sequencing and microarray data can be used to call CNVs, which can be used in association tests, such as association between CNV number and disease status. Unlike genotypes, CNV detection in microarrays requires the use of observed intensity signals at each probe, which limits the imputability for analyses that span multiple array types. Thus far, a consensus set of probes (the intersection encompassing the probes that occur in common on all arrays) has been used to circumvent the problem of differing array-specific sensitivities. This has, however, led to excessive reduction in overall sensitivity of CNV calls as arrays can have an undesirably low overlap of probe sets. To overcome this limitation, we developed MarkerMatch, a proximity-based algorithm that matches probes across different genotyping microarrays to maximize the number of probes considered in the CNV calling algorithm, thereby increasing the resolution and sensitivity while preserving precision. By analyzing CNV calls from 4,906 individuals genotyped across three different arrays (Global Screening Array, Omni2.5 array, and Omni Express Exome array), we show that the MarkerMatch approach improves sensitivity by increasing the density of probes available for CNV calling while maintaining precision or improving it relative to the current practice (e.g., use of consensus probes only). We further demonstrate that MarkerMatch exceeds the output from current practice in terms of F1 score, Fowlkes-Mallows index, and Jaccard index. We also optimize MarkerMatch parameters, DMAX and Method, and find an optimal DMAX setting at 10kb, with no clear optimal candidate based on Method, indicating that parameters for this metric should be determined on a use case basis.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we present a cryo-EM structure of human Nav1.5 in an intermediate open state, stabilized by interactions between the N-terminal domain and the S6I segment. This structure reveals a previously uncharacterized Na+ binding site adjacent to the conserved inactivation (IFM) motif. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that monovalent cations stably occupy this site, while electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that ion binding modulates IFM motif docking and fast inactivation kinetics. Our findings reveal that IFM accessibility is dynamically regulated in this intermediate state, challenging the canonical hinged-lid model of fast inactivation.

The routine use of periodic boundary conditions and electrostatic approximations, such as particle-mesh Ewald (PME), may produce finite-size effect errors that become non-negligible as a perturbation changes a simulation cell's net charge away from zero. Two prevalent strategies exist to correct for these errors: the analytic correction (AC) and co-alchemical ion (CI) methods. Both correction schemes have been found to produce comparable relative free energy results for small molecule perturbations, but these methods have not been compared using {lambda}-dynamics ({lambda}D) free energy calculations or for protein side chain mutations. Recently, we investigated relative folding and binding free energies ({Delta}{Delta}Gs) of a series of EXOSC3 variants involved in a rare neurodegenerative disorder, including D132A, G135R, and G191D charge-change perturbations, with a simplified AC scheme in {lambda}D. In this study, these perturbations are reevaluated with the CI scheme for comparison with AC to identify the best correction strategy for {lambda}D. The collected AC- and CI-corrected {Delta}{Delta}Gs show excellent agreement with a mean unsigned error of 0.4 kcal/mol. However, reduced sampling proficiency and increased difficulties of evaluating multisite perturbations with the CI method suggest that a simplified AC approach may be more generalizable for future {lambda}D calculations. Previously, the use of the CI approach with {lambda}D has been limited due to a lack of infrastructure available to users to simplify its more involved setup procedure. This study introduces an automated workflow for implementation of the CI approach with {lambda}D, laying the foundation for future comparisons between charge-change correction schemes. These studies facilitated analysis of the {lambda}D trajectories to identify structural changes within EXOSC3 and the RNA exosome complex that clearly rationalize the calculated {Delta}{Delta}Gs for the D132A, G135R, G191C, and G191D EXOSC3 variants, providing insight into potential disease-causing mechanisms of EXOSC3 modifications.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

These interactions almost universally require DNA deformation and the accumulation of local mechanical strain within the double helix. As a result, TF-DNA recognition is determined not only by the linear base sequence but also by the spatial alignment of bases and phosphates, as well as their ability to adopt and retain structural deformations. However, the sequence-centric focus of existing studies makes it challenging to directly probe DNA structural determinants and to decouple their impact from alterations in base sequences, limiting our ability to unravel the key factors influencing binding beyond the sequence identity and leaving significant gaps in our understanding of the principles governing TF-DNA recognition. Here, we introduce a high-throughput strategy to perturb TF binding sites without altering their base sequence, enabling systematic investigation of the structural features of DNA that govern TF binding. Our method, PIC-NIC, introduces single-strand breaks (SSBs) at every position within the binding site, selectively disrupting backbone continuity while preserving nucleotide identity, with the resulting effects on TF binding measured quantitatively. Applied to 15 human TFs spanning eight structural classes, and supported by seven high-resolution TF-DNA crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations, PIC-NIC uncovers discrete backbone positions serving as structural anchor points where nicks can abolish binding, rewire sequence preferences, or even enhance affinity. By decoupling structural and chemical contributions, we demonstrate that DNA mechanics--encoded in backbone geometry and continuity--can independently shape binding specificity beyond the linear code of base identity. These findings shift the paradigm of TF-DNA recognition, establishing the backbone not as a passive scaffold, but as a functional determinant capable of directing regulatory mechanisms through its physical architecture.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

The origin of this functional diversity and its physiological relevance remain unclear. Here, we show that the monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) interacts with ASIC1a, leading to subtype-specific modulation of proton sensitivity and desensitization. We delineate the molecular mechanism of the ASIC1a-MCT1 coupling and find that the presence of MCT1 is required for the distinct ASIC1a-mediated currents observed in glioblastoma cells, the most lethal brain cancer in adults. Strikingly, presence of ASIC1a together with MCT1 significantly prolongs the lifespan of mice intracranially injected with glioblastoma cells. We thus uncover the basis for altered ASIC1a function in glioblastoma and highlight the importance of deciphering the cell-type specific ASIC1a interactome.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we report that breast tumors arising in the left (L) versus right (R) mammary glands exhibit significant asymmetry in composition, bioelectric state, and epigenetic regulation suggesting the existence of a stable, lateralized tumor TME shaped by differential cell communication. By mining TCGA data of invasive ductal carcinomas, we found that R-sided tumors display a higher stromal content, particularly enriched in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Further subtype analysis revealed a predominance of inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) in R tumors and dividing CAFs (dCAFs) in L tumors, suggesting distinct TME profiles. These CAF differences were confirmed in paired L-R xenografts, where R tumors showed increased a-SMA content. Conditioning cell culture experiments with mammary tissue extracts demonstrated that L-sided environments induce greater membrane depolarization in breast cancer cells. These bioelectric differences were as well replicated in paired L-R xenograft tumors, where L tumors consistently exhibited a depolarized membrane potential relative to their R counterparts. Methylome profiling by Nanopore Sequencing revealed that L tumors were hypermethylated at key ion channel genes involved in electrical cell communication -most notably connexins- correlating with their reduced gene expression. A computational model further showed that bistable membrane potential and methylation states can emerge spontaneously, governed by the strength of Gap Junction-mediated communication and the initial state. Taking together, our results reveal a previously unrecognized L-R asymmetry in tumor biology, in which stromal composition and cell communication mechanisms establish stable, lateralized bioelectric and epigenetic states. These findings have broad implications for understanding tumor heterogeneity, TME conditioning, and the possibility of side-specific therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

This negative regulation is reversed by small-molecule inhibitors of PARP7 catalytic activity, resulting in increased IFNb expression. Yet, the mechanism of action of PARP7 inhibitors remains unclear because the relevant substrates of PARP7-mediated MARylation are unknown. Using an optimized analog-sensitive chemical genetic (ASCG) approach, we identified the co-activators, p300 and CBP, as nuclear PARP7 substrates. We identified an alpha-helical domain in PARP7 essential for p300/CBP interaction, MARylation, and proteasome degradation. Disrupting PARP7-p300/CBP interaction prevents PARP7-mediated suppression of IFNb in colorectal cancer cells. p300/CBP reciprocally regulate PARP7 activity and nuclear localization. Intriguingly, treatment with PARP7 inhibitors increased IFNb expression more than PARP7 knockout in a p300/CBP-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that in some contexts, IFNb induction by PARP7 inhibitors occurs via two mechanisms: inhibiting MARylation of p300/CBP (loss-of-function) and stabilizing the PARP7-p300/CBP complex (gain-of-function).", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Renal microvascular (MV) rarefaction plays an important role in kidney disease, but its natural history, underlying mechanisms, and contributions to renal disease progression in ADPKD remain unknown. We hypothesized that intrarenal MV rarefaction is present early on and is preceded by vascular transcriptional and metabolic changes. Methods: Pkd1RC/RC and WT mice (n=16 each) were studied at 1, 6, and 12 months. Total kidney volume (TKV) was measured in vivo (MRI), whereas renal MV architecture (3DmicroCT), capillary density, perivascular fibrosis, and histomorphometric parameters were assessed ex vivo. In randomly selected Pkd1RC/RC and WT kidneys (n=5, each/timepoint), mRNA sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed vasculature-related genes (DEGs). Next, in young individuals with ADPKD and matched controls (n=10 each), plasma cellular energy metabolites were determined (LCMS/MS), validated in an extended cohort (n=32 and n=16, respectively), and correlated with markers of disease severity and progression. Gene metabolite interaction networks were generated to integrate DEGs in Pkd1RC/RC at 1 month with metabolites dysregulated in individuals with ADPKD. Results: Renal MV density was preserved at 1 month but progressively decreased at 6 and 12 months, associated with capillary loss and perivascular fibrosis. A total of 110, 48, and 201 DEGs were identified at 1, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Plasma gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and homocysteine (Hcy) levels were higher in individuals with ADPKD versus controls, interacted with DEGs implicated in inflammatory and innate immune response and Hcy metabolism, and correlated with TKV and renal blood flow. Conclusions: Our data demonstrates that intrarenal MV abnormalities present early in ADPKD and are preceded by vascular transcriptional and metabolic changes.

Using cell type-specific tracing, we show that LDT neurons preferentially innervate NAc medium spiny neurons and cholinergic interneurons. Large-scale in vivo recordings reveal that cocaine pre-exposure induces persistent alterations in both LDT and NAc neuronal dynamics and modifies responses to subsequent cocaine challenge. Remarkably, pre-exposure to cocaine triggers population-specific adaptations in the LDT, selectively enhancing excitability of LDT-NAc-projecting cholinergic neurons while reducing that of non-projecting cholinergic cells.

Moreover, questions about the relationship between impaired consciousness and lateralization, hemispheric spread and electrophysiological characteristics of seizures are yet to be answered. To address these gaps, we conducted in-depth investigation of behavioral and intracranial EEG data from 186 mesial temporal lobe seizures of 51 patients with intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. We found that bilateral mesial temporal spread of seizures is not a necessary condition for impaired consciousness, although seizures with bilateral mesial temporal involvement were significantly more likely to have impaired consciousness than unilateral seizures. Contrary to prior belief, we found no relationship between the onset side (left vs. right temporal lobe or language dominant vs. non-dominant lobe) of seizures and the probability of impaired consciousness. Lastly, we established that widespread increases in slow-wave activity (delta band) in extratemporal cortical areas, as well as increases in fast activity (beta band) in the temporal lobes were both robust markers of seizures with impaired consciousness and could predict ictal impairment with up to 86% accuracy. Our findings shed new light on networks that underlie impaired consciousness in temporal lobe epilepsy and may help guide deep brain stimulation of such systems (e.g. via thalamic nuclei) as a potential intervention to improve consciousness during seizures.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

ENS dysfunction or loss is associated with gastrointestinal disorders such as Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Currently, surgery is the only treatment for HSCR, but it often has lifelong, severe complications. Restoring missing ENS neurons by stimulating endogenous neuronal regeneration presents a promising therapeutic approach for ENS disease. To study the cellular-molecular mechanisms of neuronal regeneration we first need to identify an animal model system with robust ENS regeneration. For this, we developed a chemical-genetic ablation model in zebrafish using the Gal4/UAS NTR 2.0 system for targeted ENS neuron ablation. Spatially and temporally controlled neuronal death was confirmed by morphological changes, complete neuronal loss, and TUNEL assays. Quantification of regenerated neurons demonstrated complete restoration of ENS neuron numbers to control levels by 9 days post treatment with recovery of gut motility. Among the regenerated neurons, nitrergic, cholinergic and vipergic subtypes showed full recovery, whereas serotonergic neurons only displayed partial recovery, indicating subtype-specific differences in the regenerative capacity and/or timing. Our study establishes a robust platform for dissecting the cellular molecular mechanisms of ENS regeneration to develop potential treatment approaches for ENS-related diseases.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Through chemo-genetic ablation of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons in larval zebrafish and brain-wide calcium imaging under head-fixed, tail-free conditions, we uncovered a neural mechanism underlying this phenomenon. While catecholamine (CA)-deficient larvae exhibited severe locomotor deficits during free swimming, they showed paradoxical recovery of tail movements during whole-brain neural activity imaging. This locomotor recovery was accompanied by a significantly increased number of active neurons in the midbrain and hindbrain, but with reduced firing rates. Further analyses across 2158 anatomically defined regions allowed us to uncover a subset of regions, genes, and neurotransmitter types. GABAergic neurons were found to primarily account for the hyperactivity in the hindbrain, while glutamatergic neurons accounted for the hyperactivity in the midbrain. Hierarchical clustering of neuronal activity with tail movements revealed distinct motor- and non-motor-associated hyperactive clusters in the hindbrain and midbrain, respectively. We identified the Mesencephalic Locomotor Region (MLR) sandwiched between these domains, with enhanced glutamatergic firing rate and cholinergic activation. Furthermore, we found that Telencephalic corticotropin-releasing factor b (crhb) expressing neurons play a crucial role in mediating stress-response to the tectum, which in turn triggers a cascade of neuronal hyperactivity downstream via MLR. These findings reveal a neural mechanism that links stress-induced sensory processing with motor control systems in the absence of regulatory feedback from catecholaminergic neurons, suggesting a direct, unmodulated pathway that bypasses typical inhibitory controls.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

A lack of discernment regarding how tasks and the resting state commonly and uniquely support executive functions precludes a holistic understanding of the neurobiological basis of executive functions. This project investigated differences in brain network organization and relationships with executive function ability between the resting state and two executive function tasks, a stop signal task and an emotional n-back task, using the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study dataset. Both executive function tasks evoked a more integrated network organization than the resting state, and executive function ability was related to different aspects of brain network organization during the resting state and during the tasks. Further, task-related shifts in brain network organization evoked several new relationships with executive function that were not detectable during the resting state and strengthened a relationship with executive function that existed weakly during the resting state. Overall, this study establishes a distinction between common and unique features of intrinsic and task-evoked brain function that facilitate executive function in children.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we reveal that TMC1 and TMC2 are cholesterol-regulated lipid scramblases whose activity modulates plasma membrane asymmetry. Using reconstituted proteoliposomes and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that both proteins facilitate phospholipid translocation across membrane bilayers, a process tuned by cholesterol and enhanced by deafness-causing TMC1 mutations. We show that this scramblase activity correlates with TMC1-dependent externalization of phosphatidylserine and membrane blebbing in murine auditory hair cells, linking TMC1-dependent membrane homeostasis dysregulation to auditory sensory cell pathology.

However, TMS-evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) can be affected by components unrelated to TMS direct neuronal activation. Accurate, automatic tools are therefore needed to establish the quality of TEPs. Objective: To assess the discriminability of EEG responses to TMS vs. EEG responses to sham stimulations using sequence-to-sequence machine learning (ML). Methods: Two indipendent TMS-EEG datasets including TMS and several sham stimulation conditions were obtained from the left motor area of healthy volunteers (N=33 across datasets). A Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) ML network was used to label each time point of the EEG signals as pertaining to TMS or sham conditions. Main outcome measures included accuracy at single-trial level and after averaging five to twenty trials. Results: For TMS conditions, post-stimulus vs. baseline/pre-stimulus EEG comparisons yielded moderate (60%-75%) single-trial accuracy and high-accuracy (>75%) for 20 trials across datasets, while for sham conditions post- vs. baseline/pre-stimulus EEG comparisons yielded lower accuracy rates than for TMS conditions, except for unmasked auditory stimulation. Furthermore, baseline/pre-stimulus TMS vs. baseline/pre-stimulus sham EEG comparisons showed chance-level accuracy, whereas post-stimulus TMS vs. post-stimulus sham EEG comparisons had moderate (single trial) to high (20 trial) accuracy, except for TMS with and without the click noise masking.

Here, we employ single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and paired single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing (scTCR-seq) to profile tissue-resident memory-like T cells (TRMLs) from matched non-cancerous FT, metastatic omental tumors, and peripheral blood in HGSOC patients. Surprisingly, we identify a substantial clonal and functional overlap between TRMLs from non-cancerous FT and tumor-infiltrating TRMLs, with 18.4% of tumor TRML clonotypes being shared with FT TRMLs, significantly exceeding overlap with circulating T cells. Shared TCR clonotypes are preferentially enriched in exhausted CD8+ T cells (CD8-Tex) and proliferative exhausted CD8+ subsets, suggesting prior antigenic exposure. Notably, we identify a previously uncharacterized CD8+ SIK3-high subset enriched in tumors, with gene expression signatures implicating epigenetic plasticity and metabolic adaptation. Functionally, non-cancerous FT-derived TRMLs recognize autologous tumor antigens, as evidenced by robust IFN-r responses in tumor organoid co-culture assays and CD137 upregulation. Whole-genome and transcriptomic analyses reveal shared somatic mutations between the FT and tumor, supporting the FT as the tumor's evolutionary origin. Predicted tumor neoantigens elicit TRML responses in the non-cancerous FT, and single-cell TCR profiling confirms that neoantigen-reactive T cells in FT share clonotypes with tumor-infiltrating TRMLs, further reinforcing their role in early immune surveillance. Importantly, FT-derived TRMLs exhibit lower exhaustion signatures than their tumor counterparts, suggesting their potential as a preferable source for adoptive T cell therapies.

The present study aimed to delineate the functional role of ARL15 in RA pathobiology using gene knockdown (KD) combined with transcriptomic profiling in both ex-vivo RA synovial fibroblasts (RASF) and in vitro MH7A cell lines. In RASF, ARL15 KD led to the downregulation of COMP-an extracellular matrix stabilizer linked to severe RA-alongside upregulation of adiponectin and IFN response genes such as IFI6 and USP18. Furthermore, upregulation of NPTX1 and MX1, previously associated with disease modulation and treatment response was observed. Downregulation of CTGF, CD248, and PTX3 suggested involvement of ARL15 in inflammation and RA-associated cardiovascular risk. In contrast, ARL15 KD in MH7A cells displayed distinct gene signatures with upregulated cytokines (IL1A, IL8, CXCLs) and downregulated inflammatory regulators (DOCK2, TLR4, TGFB2), reflecting an inflammatory bias distinct from the patient-derived RASF. This divergence highlights the limitations of immortalized cell models in capturing patient heterogeneity and disease complexity. However, the dual-system approach underscores the multifaceted role of ARL15 in regulating connective tissue architecture, inflammation, and immune response. These key findings position ARL15 as a promising therapeutic target, warranting further investigation in RA animal models and genomic medicine.

In addition to the persistence of legacy compounds, pollutants of various families are being released into the environment, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and phthalate diesters (PAEs). Heretofore, these pollutants have received insufficient attention in freshwater vertebrates, particularly in reptiles, considering their potential to trigger detrimental effects on organisms. During two years (2019 and 2020), we quantified plasma levels of 46 compounds from 6 chemical families in two monitored populations of the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis) in the Camargue wetland, France. PAHs and PAEs were often found concomitantly and with similar occurrences and levels in the two populations. We observed similar inter-annual variations in PAHs and PAEs with differences between males and females, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the role of sex in the exposure pathway and the toxicokinetics of contaminants, especially in turtles. The negative relationship between PAH levels and age, as well as the high intra-individual variation in levels of both contaminant families, provides further evidence of limited bioaccumulation of these pollutants in the blood of E. orbicularis. This could be explained by the metabolic biotransformation of parent compounds and the need to quantify the levels of PAH metabolites and phthalate monoesters.

In these systems, merolimnic insects serve as crucial ecological links, occupying aquatic habitats as larvae and terrestrial environments as adults, thus being an essential food source in both. Consequently, pollutant exposure during the aquatic larval stage can have cascading effects across ecosystem boundaries. While the ecological consequences of such exposure are well documented, the evolutionary potential of merolimnic insects to adapt to chronic pollution remains poorly understood. To address this, we previously conducted a selection experiment exposing populations of the non-biting midge Chironomus riparius to the mosquito larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) or heavy metal copper over approximately eight generations, which revealed only limited evidence of consistent phenotypic adaptation. Here we use whole-genome sequencing of these populations to assess their genomic responses to chronic pollutant exposure. Despite similar phenotypic sensitivity in pre-exposed and naive populations, we detected distinct stressor-specific genomic responses. Copper exposure induced a significant genome-wide reduction in nucleotide diversity and evidence of selection-driven allele frequency changes, while Bti effects were dominated by heterogeneous, replicate-specific shifts, potentially reflecting drift or selection on multiple redundant pathways. Functional enrichment analyses indicated early-stage adaptation: immune- and apoptosis-related pathways were enriched under Bti, while metal detoxification and DNA repair pathways were enriched under copper, highlighting distinct adaptive mechanisms despite weak genome-wide signals of selection.

While the total number of older siblings was not associated with an individual's childhood survival, distinguishing between siblings by their survival status, age, and sex revealed several associations, which in some cases also interacted with the sex of the focal individual: While older brothers close in age reduced the survival of girls but not boys, having more older sisters born close in age improved their younger sibling's survival. Our results, therefore, show that sibling interactions play an important role in shaping early-life survival, and highlight that the strength and direction of these effects are context-dependent and can arise through biological and cultural factors.

Here, we investigate how variation in environmentally mediated social behaviour, such as helping to improve shared resources, can emerge and persist in spatially subdivided populations where locally modified environments are transmitted across generations. Using mathematical and computational modelling, we show that ecological inheritance, when combined with limited dispersal, readily leads to the stable coexistence of two types with opposite environmental legacies: helpers, who improve the local environment for the future at a personal cost, and environmental free-riders, who benefit without contributing to the detriment of future generations. In turn, this polymorphism generates lasting spatial heterogeneity in environmental quality and, consequently, in survival and reproduction -- particularly under isolation-by-distance, creating stable clusters of high- and low-quality habitats across an otherwise homogeneous landscape.

Using whole-genome resequencing data from 312 individuals across 23 populations, we applied two complementary selection scan methods to assess how structural genomic variants, such as inversions, affect the detection of adaptive signals. Our findings reveal that large polymorphic inversions are significantly enriched for selection signals, thereby reinforcing their pivotal role in adaptation. However, these same inversions can complicate the interpretation of selection signals within their boundaries, where recombination suppression can obscure the true targets of selection. In contrast, the detection of selection in collinear regions is largely unaffected by the presence of inversions. To overcome the confounding effects within inversions, we demonstrate that focusing on homozygote genotypes enables the identification of candidate regions and haplotype-specific signals. Our findings highlight the contribution of inversions to adaptation, emphasising the importance of understanding species-specific genomic architecture when interpreting selection scan results.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

A.; Newrzella, N.; Roth, O.", "abstract": "Intermittent fasting is widely promoted for its potential to improve health and extend lifespan, yet these benefits may come at a reproductive cost, potentially reducing parental fitness and offspring quality. While the inter- and transgenerational effects of fasting are increasingly studied, they remain poorly understood in species with unconventional reproductive roles. Investigating such effects in these systems is crucial, as the evolutionary trade-offs between somatic maintenance and reproductive investment may differ from those in species with conventional reproductive roles. In this study, we investigated the effects of intermittent fasting (IF) in a species with male pregnancy, Syngnathus typhle, by exposing mothers and fathers to either IF or ad libitum (AL) feeding before mating. Upon transfer of maternal eggs to paternal brood pouches, males remained on their assigned diets throughout pregnancy. Offspring from all parental diet combinations AL(p)xAL(m), IF(p)xIF(m), AL(p)xIF(m), IF(p)xAL(m) were analyzed at birth before first feeding alongside parents for morphology, immune and epigenetic candidate gene expression, and gut microbiota composition. Mothers under IF showed greater condition loss, leading to reduced offspring condition regardless of paternal diet, highlighting the importance of maternal provisioning through eggs. However, IF fathers exhibited increased immune activation and microbiome shifts that were mirrored in offspring, suggesting paternal priming via epigenetic and microbial inheritance. Offspring from mismatched parental diets showed disrupted immune-microbiome correlations, indicating that aligned parental cues support more stable offspring development. These findings highlight how parental nutritional history shapes offspring resilience and emphasize the value of studying species with diverse reproductive strategies and life histories to understand the full spectrum of trans-generational plasticity in nature.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the plasma and tissue proteome and derive tissue-specific pQTLs in a unique dataset derived from a cohort of 284 STARNET patients, predominantly male, with a mean age of 65 years and a high prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD).Importantly, our dataset includes paired tissue samples from aortic wall, mammary artery, liver, and skeletal muscle alongside plasma, allowing for a comprehensive comparative analysis across tissues- all from the same individuals.

In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) to analyze healthy and aganglionic colon segments from HSCR patients. Using scRNA-seq, we identified 13 major cell types in patient samples and observed that neural progenitor cells were present in both healthy and aganglionic colon regions, while mature neurons were absent from aganglionic colon. In these progenitor cells, critical differentiation pathway genes displayed reduced expression in the aganglionic colon, suggesting a disruption in their transition to mature neuronal cell types. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis revealed significant alterations in gene expression across several stromal cell types. These transcriptomic shifts, particularly in mast cells, support the hypothesis that altered gene expression in the microenvironment of neural progenitor cells contributes to impaired differentiation. Our findings support the hypothesis that neural precursors in HSCR are capable of migration, but they are defective in their differentiation to mature cell types.

Yet predicting what information will be gained from genomic data about variables of interest and how different sampling strategies will impact the quality of downstream inferences remains challenging. As a result, population genomics largely lacks theory to guide decisions on how best to sample individuals for genomic sequencing. By adopting a sequential decision making framework, we show how Markov decision processes (MDPs) can be applied to jointly model a populations dynamics along with the sampling process. Critically, these MDPs allow us to compute the expected long-term value of sampling in terms of information gained about estimated variables. This in turn allows us to very efficiently explore and identify optimal sampling strategies. To illustrate our framework, we develop MDPs for three common demographic and epidemiological inference problems: estimating population growth rates, minimizing the transmission distance between sampled individuals and estimating migration rates between subpopulations. In each case, the MDP allows us to identify optimal sampling strategies that maximize the information gained from genomic data while minimizing costs.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

A minor portion of this diversity comprise predominantly free-living \"turbellarians\" Phylogenetic relationships within turbellarian orders remain debated, with recent mitochondrial genome studies also questioning the monophyly of the \"Neoophora clade\" . Some unique mitochondrial gene features have also been observed in this group. Within Turbellaria, the order Rhabdocoela includes significant symbiotic lineages, such as the endosymbiotic Umagillidae, Pterastericolidae, and Graffillidae, and the ectosymbiotic Temnocephalidae, which notably exhibits characteristics akin to a parasitic lifestyle. Given evidence linking parasitic lifestyles to accelerated mitogenomic evolution, we hypothesize that similar patterns: symbiotic turbellarians have mitochondrial genomes that accelerate evolution compared to free-living turbellarians. This study presents the first complete mitochondrial genome of the ectosymbiont Craspedella pedum, provides mitogenomic insights into turbellarian phylogeny, and addressing our hypothesis. Results: The mitochondrial genome of Craspedella pedum is a circular DNA molecule of 18,456 base pairs, containing the standard 36 flatworm mitochondrial genes, a duplicated trnT, two cox1 pseudogene fragments, a putative atp8 gene, and several distinctive NCRs. Phylogenetic analyses based on 47 mitochondrial genomes, including the newly sequenced C. pedum and two assembled species from SRA database, using CAT-GTR model and BI and ML algorithms further confirmed that the paraphyly of the Neoophora clade and the basal position of Catenulida and Macrostomida. Different from previous study, Rhabdocoela forms a distinct clade within the turbellarians diverged immediately after Macrostomida before Polycladida and Tricladida. Within Rhabdocoela, C. pedum formed a direct sister clade with Typhloplanidae, suggesting a close phylogenetic relationship between the two. We also identified the paraphyletic of the Planoceridae of Polycladida and the unstable position of Planariidae within Tricladidain. Furthermore, we found a trend that the nad4L-nad4 gene box in turbellarians may have evolved from an overlapping state, to the insertion of a non-coding region (NCR), and subsequently to a separated configuration, correlating with species divergence. The selection pressure analysis showcased selective relaxation from free-living species of Rhabdocoela to symbiotic species of Rhabdocoela. Furthermore, we also detected a relaxation from certain tubellarian lineages to Rhabdocoela. Along with higher GORR and longer Brl, Rhabdocoela and its symbiotic group possesses a more rapidly evolving mitochondrial genome. Conclusions: The mitochondrial genome of Craspedella pedum displays uncommon characteristics, combined extended branch lengths and elevated GORR, suggesting rapid evolution and extensive rearrangements. Our phylogenetic analysis, integrating additional mitogenome data, further corroborates the paraphyly of the Neoophora clade and offers novel insights into turbellarian phylogeny. For the first time, we confirmed the accelerated evolution of mitochondrial genomes in symbiotic tubellarians compared to free-living ones, as evidenced by a longer average Brl, a higher average GORR, and relaxed selection pressure. Additionally, with the same evidences, we found that Rhabdocoela also exhibited accelerated mitochondrial genome evolution in planarians.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

STR genotyping is usually performed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) or next-generation sequencing (NGS) in centralized laboratories. However, there is an increasing need for a low cost, portable and rapid STR genotyping method. Multiple methods for miniaturization have been explored, all relying on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for generating amplicons. PCR requires precise thermal cycling, which complicates the design of the STR genotyping microfluidic device. Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) is an isothermal DNA amplification method that operates between 37 and 42 degrees Celsius and completes within 40 minutes. This, along with the robustness of reagents and reduced stutter rate compared to PCR makes RPA a suitable candidate for implementation in an STR genotyping microfluidics device as well as a part of the established STR genotyping work flows. In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluate RPA assay for amplification of forensically relevant STR loci. Thirteen core STR loci of the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) were amplified using RPA in both singleplex and multiplex formats. The amplicons were then analyzed using three different methods: CE, Illumina and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). A subset of 5 loci was used for CE analysis. CE, Illumina and ONT sequencing of singleplex RPA each resulted in complete and correct STR profiles across all samples. Sensitivity assessment demonstrated that complete and correct genotypes were achieved with DNA inputs of 62 pg and above for all but locus D8S1179.

In yeast, we find that GLM-Prior outperforms motif-based and curated priors, and that downstream gene expression based inference adds little additional value, indicating that most regulatory signal is captured directly from sequence. We show that, across yeast, mouse, and human, GLM-Prior consistently improves GRN inference accuracy and generalizes across species, enabling zero-shot transfer between human and mouse without retraining.

Here, we investigated the role of transcriptomic entropy in aging and cancer processes by analyzing RNA-sequencing data from thousands of human and mouse samples. We found that entropy changes during aging are highly tissue-specific, with some tissues showing increased entropy while others exhibit decreased or stable entropy levels. Transcriptomic entropy strongly correlates with age-related processes, showing positive associations with proliferation, cellular senescence, and somatic mutation burden, while negatively correlating with stemness. Surprisingly, cellular reprogramming also increases transcriptomic entropy. In cancer, we observed that primary tumors generally display higher entropy than normal tissue, with entropy levels further increasing in metastatic stages. Notably, treatment-resistant tumors showed distinct entropy patterns, with acquired resistance associated with increased entropy, while primary resistance and immediate post-treatment responses showed decreased entropy. Higher entropy levels predicted poor survival outcomes in multiple cancer types, suggesting its potential as a prognostic marker. Furthermore, differential expression analysis revealed that entropy-associated genes are enriched in developmental processes and depleted in metabolic pathways, indicating a possible link to cellular dedifferentiation. Finally, we found increased entropy in various age-related diseases beyond cancer, suggesting that transcriptomic disorder may be a common feature in age-related pathologies. Our findings establish transcriptomic entropy as a fundamental parameter in aging and cancer progression, offering new insights into disease mechanisms and challenging the current view that increased disorder is always detrimental.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

They are organized into epigenetically discrete compartments: a Centromere Protein A (CENP-A)-rich core for microtubule attachment and surrounding heterochromatic pericentromeres that promote cohesion. Despite their importance, the mechanisms that define, enforce and partition these chromatin domains remain poorly understood. To address this, we disrupted key H3K9 methyltransferases, SUV39H1, SUV39H2, and SETDB1, that establish heterochromatin in humans. We find that SETDB1 is required for H3K9 dimethylation at core centromeres, while SUV39H1/2 complete trimethylation. Unexpectedly, depleting all three enzymes results in aberrantly high H3K9me3, driving CENP-A expansion into pericentromeres. This promiscuous deposition is mediated by G9a/GLP methyltransferases, which selectively reestablish H3K9me3 within the centromere core. SETDB1, regardless of its enzymatic activity, blocks G9a/GLP-mediated heterochromatin deposition and CENP-A expansion, revealing a novel, catalytic-independent function in safeguarding centromeres.

This includes reagents to modulate activity and abundance of deubiquitinases (DUBs), which critically regulate ubiquitin-mediated signaling. Here, using an integrated chemical biology approach, we explored the cellular function of the DUB USP7 as a case study comparing inhibition and degradation of this DUB in melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells. Through the synthesis of a degrader library, we identified potent USP7 PROTACs for each cancer type, established BRET-based ternary complex formation and quantified degradation efficiency. USP7 degraders and their cognate inhibitor were subsequently employed to characterize treatment-induced phenotypic alterations. Proteomic and cellular analyses revealed that highly specific degradation of USP7 modulated both shared and distinct protein sets across cancer cell types, without impacting cell growth. Notably, cellular responses to USP7 degradation differed markedly from those to USP7 inhibition. Moreover, our data uncovered broad proteomic and metabolic changes induced by prolonged USP7 inhibitor treatment. Collectively, our work provides a chemical toolbox of comprehensively characterized reagents to distinguish on-target phenotypes which will aid the understanding of the role of USP7 in malignant diseases.

Here we investigate the folding of the 15-mer thrombin- binding aptamer G-quadruplex (G4) and the designed 35-mer TAA(C5TAA)4 i-motif (iM) inside living osteosarcoma cells. We use fast relaxation imaging, which couples fluorescence microscopy with a laser-induced temperature jump, to quantify the stability and dynamics of FRET-labeled constructs. The melting temperature of G4 and iM inside cells are 44.9 {+/-} 0.9 {degrees}C and 46.5 {+/-} 0.6 {degrees}C, respectively. Compared to in vitro buffers, inside cells G4 is destabilized by {approx}10 {degrees}C and iM is stabilized by {approx}20 {degrees}C.

Among these, microbial rhodopsins are unique in their unparalleled capacity to harness light to drive ion translocation. This distinctive feature has led to their widespread use as optogenetic tools in neuroscience, physiology, and biomedical applications. While not all microbial rhodopsins function as ion transporters, many ion-translocating variants have been discovered since the identification of the first member - a light-driven H+ pump - in the 1970s. These proteins share a compact structure composed of only seven transmembrane helices and have long been thought to specialize exclusively in transporting small inorganic ions such as H+, Cl-, and Na+. Here, we show that several anion-pumping microbial rhodopsins can also transport organic anions. In particular, a rhodopsin from cyanobacteria is capable of transporting bulky organic anions, including those containing benzene rings, with molecular volumes up to ~120 [A]3 - five times that of Cl-. These organic ions bind to the dark state and are translocated upon photoactivation, following a mechanism similar to that of inorganic anion transport. Mutational analysis indicates that both classes of substrates share a common binding site. Only anions with pKa values below 2 were transported, suggesting that a retained negative charge is essential for binding to the dark state - a prerequisite for transport. This study expands the known substrate repertoire of microbial rhodopsins and introduces new possibilities for optogenetic strategies based on light-driven delivery of bioactive organic molecules.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to establish an in vitro model of HPV-induced precancerous lesions for preclinical drug testing and to provide an automated method for quantifying cell counts to assess treatment effects in this model. To establish organotypic epithelial raft cultures (OTCs) as a model of HPV-induced precancerous lesions, we cultivated HPV-transformed cervical cancer cell lines SiHa, CaSki, HeLa, and SW756 in conjunction with primary human keratinocytes on a dermal equivalent and evaluated the impact of different cultivation variables. To demonstrate suitability of our model for preclinical drug application studies, we applied 5-fluorouracil, sinecatechins, and cisplatin either onto the air-exposed surface or to the growth medium, mimicking topical and systemic drug administration routes. We then developed a machine learning-based approach to quantify cell counts reflecting treatment effects in the established OTCs. We successfully optimized a durable in vitro model of HPV-induced precancerous lesions. The model enabled monitoring of treatment effects in a three-dimensional context with differentiated consideration of the targeted HPV-transformed cells and surrounding normal epithelium. We demonstrated that extreme gradient boosted tree classifiers (XGBoost) can be successfully used to distinguish the number of tumor cells, normal keratinocytes, and degraded cells with high accuracy (81.8%; P=2*10^-6). Critically, quantification results plausibly reflected microscopical observations and gave a fine-grained picture of time- and dose-dependent treatment effects. The established model in combination with automated cell quantification can serve as a valuable tool in analyzing major preclinical endpoints in in vitro studies, such as target cell treatment efficacy, potential side effects, and treatment schedule optimization.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

This two-host species is one of the main vectors of the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus. Knowing the phenology of the tick is a prerequisite for a better understanding of its spread and of CCHF virus dispersal. A six-year study was carried out in a horse herd to determine the seasonal variations of H. marginatum infestation. Adult ticks started infesting their hosts from the beginning of March. Infestation peaked during the first weeks of May and then steadily decreased until the end of August. This represented an average annual infestation of more than 300 H. marginatum per horse. Birds are parasitised by H. marginatum immatures (larvae and nymphs) in summer, between mid/late June to the end of September. The larvae are therefore not yet active when the migratory birds pass through in spring. Blackbirds, Turdus merula, were the most infested species: sixty percent of those examined in summer were parasitised by H. marginatum. This bird species could be a good sentinel host for monitoring the establishment of the species in currently H. marginatum-free areas. To complete this multi-year survey, an experimental study was carried out in quasi-natural conditions, with engorged ticks placed in cages in the garrigue. It was shown that the nymphs moulted into adults within 3-4 weeks in July-August. However, they remain completely immobile in the litter, undergoing a behavioural diapause, until the following spring. On the other hand, almost all the nymphs deposited later, in September or October, died during the cold and rainy season. It was also observed that engorged females are able to survive the cold conditions up to 6-8 months before laying eggs. The study also suggested that there were predators of H. marginatum, likely ants and spiders, in the study area. The hosts monitored over all these years were not only infested by H. marginatum. The phenology of other tick species parasitizing horses (Dermacentor marginatus, Haemaphysalis punctata, Rhipicephalus bursa) and birds (Ixodes frontalis, I. ricinus, Hae. punctata) was also highlighted for this study area.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

This study investigated the SMC-specific role of the myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (Myd88) gene, encoding an adaptor protein essential for signaling downstream of several cytokine and pattern-recognition receptors, in this process. Methods: The effects of MyD88 knockdown were assessed in cultured rat aortic SMCs. SMC-specific knockout of Myd88 was induced in mice using the Cre/lox method, followed by induction of atherosclerosis by proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene transfer and a high-fat diet for 12 or 20 weeks. Effects on plaque and fibrous cap formation were studied by immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization. Results: Myd88 knockdown reduced proliferation and migration of cultured SMCs and preserved contractile gene expression under inflammatory stimulation. SMC-specific Myd88 deficiency in hyperlipidemic mice did not significantly alter plaque size in the aortic root but reduced the number of cap SMCs in advanced lesions at 20 weeks and in the most atherosclerosis-susceptible aortic sinus at 12 weeks. Other plaque features, including macrophages, necrotic core size, and collagen content, were not significantly affected. Notably, MyD88 deficiency preserved the contractile phenotype of medial SMCs beneath plaques, suggesting that impaired phenotypic modulation contributed to reduced cap SMC recruitment. Conclusions: MyD88-dependent signaling promotes medial SMC phenotypic modulation and the recruitment of fibrous cap SMCs during atherogenesis. These findings highlight MyD88 as a mediator linking inflammatory signaling to protective fibrous cap formation.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

SpatioEv integrates automated quality control, cell phenotyping, neighbourhood identification, multi-scale spatial characterization, niche boundary analysis, ECM fiber-cell interaction mapping, and spatiotemporal trajectory inference. This pipeline enables reproducible cell annotation, reveals novel ECM-cell interactions, characterizes tissue neighbourhood boundaries, and infers developmental progressions directly from spatial data. Using this, we can identify disease-specific spatial signatures distinguishing rheumatoid arthritis from osteoarthritis, characterize diverse tumour boundary phenotypes in cancer metastases in liver, and map evolutionary trajectories in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) at single-niche resolution.

Literature evidences indicates a strong association between systemic inflammation, driven by cytokines such as Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the development of NSCLC-associated sarcopenia. However, the immuno-metabolic underpinnings that link tumor-derived IL-6 signaling to skeletal muscle degradation remain incompletely understood. We developed a comprehensive immuno-metabolic mathematical model to investigate how IL-6 signaling influences branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) metabolism and redox homeostasis in the context of NSCLC-induced sarcopenia by understanding two key causes of sarcopenia which are malnutrition and redox homeostasis. Our model integrates IL-6-mediated activation of the Janus Kinase (JAK)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway, highlighting the differential roles of STAT3 phosphorylation at S727 (mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) activation) and Y705 (nuclear translocation and transcriptional regulation of oncogenes Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha (HIF-1) and cellular Myc (c-Myc). These transcription factors reprogram tumor metabolism by upregulating glucose and amino acid transporters, including those specific to BCAAs. In skeletal muscle, elevated IL-6 disrupts insulin signaling via Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), suppresses Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) activation, and enhances oxidative stress, collectively contributing to impaired protein synthesis, increased proteolysis, and muscle wasting. BCAA dysregulation further impairs metabolic balance and exacerbates sarcopenia through defective Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle (TCA) input and epigenetic modulation via acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) and S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM). Our model reveals a central role for IL-6-driven metabolic rewiring, particularly BCAA utilization and redox imbalance, in promoting NSCLC-induced sarcopenia. These findings underscore the dual impact of IL-6 on tumor progression and systemic muscle degradation, and provide a framework for evaluating therapeutic strategies that target IL-6/STAT3 signaling and amino acid metabolism via STAT3 and acetyl-CoA cross talk to mitigate NSCLC-induced sarcopenia.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

In a within-session auditory reversal task, AC neurons supported flexible stimulus updating following rule reversal, whereas IC neurons preserved stable auditory discrimination across rules. Dual retrograde tracing revealed anatomically segregated PPC neurons projecting to AC (PPCAC) and IC (PPCIC). PPCAC neurons flexibly encoded stimulus-outcome contingencies, while PPCIC neurons stably represented response outcomes.

This can be attributed to a lack of appropriate software tools, as neuroscientific simulation software focuses on the one hand on highly detailed models, and on the other hand on massive networks featuring point-neurons. Here, we fill this gap by implementing a framework for the massively parallel simulation of simplified dendrite models with customizable subcellular dynamics. To achieve this, we leverage the NEural Simulation Tool (NEST), the neuroscientific reference with respect to efficient massively parallel simulations of point neuron networks. By co-opting the already existing model descriptions language NESTML, we generate C++ code implementing user-configurable subcellular dynamics. Through benchmarking and profiling, we show that the generated models run efficiently, leading to scalable NEST network simulations. We demonstrate relevant functionalities by showing that a key sensory computation - the association of top-down context arriving at distal dendrites in layer 1 and feedforward sensory input arriving perisomatically - can be achieved in a single shot fashion through apical calcium dynamics. Our work thus unlocks the study of how dendritic processes shape learning, and in particular of how brain-wide communication through long-range, layer 1-targetting connections steers perisomatic plasticity.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Bacillus subtilis, a well-characterized probiotic, has emerged as a promising platform for mucosal vaccine delivery due to its safety profile and ability to induce robust immune responses. In this study, we screened B cell and T cell linear epitopes from PRRSV-ORF1b, GP5, M, and N proteins to construct a recombinant tandem antigen (ER), which was displayed on the surface of B. subtilis 168 spores. The resulting recombinant strain, designated B. subtilis BE, was evaluated for immunogenicity in mice via oral administration. The results showed that Oral immunization with B. subtilis BE significantly elevated antigen-specific secretory IgA levels in intestinal contents and IgG levels in serum, indicating potent mucosal and systemic humoral responses. Moreover, B. subtilis BE induced measurable neutralizing antibody titers and enhanced cellular immunity, as evidenced by increased frequencies of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and upregulation of IFN-, TNF-, and IFN-{gamma} expression in intestinal tissues.

Yellowstone monkeyflowers range in MCD from 12-15 hours, paralleling range-wide variation in M. guttatus; plants from thermal habitats flower under significantly shorter daylengths. Two QTLs govern the most extreme 12-hour MCD. Both contain candidates from gene families previously implicated in phenological evolution in monkeyflowers and other angiosperms, but the major loci appear novel. The frequency of 12-hour flowering across a microgeographic gradient is predicted by variation in soil temperature and the timing of dry-down.

However, anthropogenic stressors, such as rising seawater temperatures, cause a breakdown of the coral-algal symbiosis, so-called coral bleaching, which leads to mass mortalities and a rapid loss of coral reefs. To functionally disassemble the coral-algal symbiosis, corals have been artificially rendered aposymbiotic using temperature stress, DCMU, or menthol. As menthol has proven to be an efficient and gentle bleaching agent, we tested four menthol treatments with six commonly investigated stony coral species. The overarching aim was to establish a broadly efficient bleaching protocol as a guide for future investigations. Menthol-induced bleaching was traced with chlorophyll fluorescence and tissue color analyses over time and confirmed as final symbiont cell density two weeks after the last day of menthol treatment. Here we found that the coral species varied greatly in their menthol bleaching tolerance, underlining the importance of establishing bespoke bleaching approaches. Acropora muricata and Stylophora pistillata were efficiently bleached within two days of menthol exposure with symbiont cell reductions of 94 % to 98 %. For Galaxea fascicularis, Montipora digitata and Porites cylindrica, six days of menthol exposure proved most successful in reducing symbiont density by 92 to 97 %. While these coral species suffered no mortality, fragments of Pocillopora verrucosa died or suffered severe necrosis in most of the protocols, making the tested menthol treatments unsuitable for this species. We demonstrate that repeated menthol treatment at low concentrations renders most coral species aposymbiotic within few days without visual or physiological damage. Our study, therefore, provides a guideline for efficient and customized application of menthol bleaching treatments for future coral symbiosis research.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Recent insights reveal that the gut microbiota undergoes changes across the 24-h day, raising the possibility that it may act as zeitgeber, helping to regulate the host's sleep-wake organisation. Despite its importance, timing factors influencing microbiome composition are poorly understood, limiting its use as a health predictor. This study investigates the relationship between stool dynamics (interval since last defecation, collection time of the sample), sleep pressure (interval since last sleep), meal timing and the composition of the gut microbiome. Stool samples from 198 healthy infants, aged 3 to 31 months, were analysed to assess microbial diversity, richness evenness, and abundance. Our findings reveal that longer intervals since the last bowel movement are associated with increased microbial diversity, evenness, and richness. Stool timing is associated with shifts in microbial composition, especially in younger infants, indicating that diurnal microbial fluctuations may become more stable as infants mature. We found that longer periods of wakefulness were associated with increased microbial diversity in early infancy, although this effect appeared to diminish with age. Feeding schedules appeared to have a limited effect on the gut microbiome. Longer fasting before sampling showed no significant associations with most microbial parameters, except for a positive association with microbial richness. At the phylum level, results indicate that infant gut microbial composition is influenced by behaviour and physiology. Longer intervals between bowel movements were associated with shifts in bacterial abundance, with Proteobacteria decreasing and Actinobacteria increasing. Stool timing and meal timing also affected microbial diversity: later sampling times showed higher Actinobacteria levels, and longer fasting was associated with reduced Bacteroidetes. Sleep pressure showed a trend effect with Firmicutes displaying a slight decrease in infants who had been awake longer. Our findings underscore the importance of time-based factors on infant gut microbiome composition.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

To elucidate CPNA's underlying mechanisms, we employed a multidisciplinary approach using immunohistochemistry, lipidomic analysis, and proteomic screening to investigate VTA molecular alterations in mice subjected to partial sciatic nerve ligation (pSNL) at one and four weeks post-injury. Our results revealed a significant, sex-dependent increase in Kv7.2 channel expression in dopamine neurons, alongside a notable reduction in endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) levels, which plays a vital role in mood regulation. This neurochemical shift associated with an increase in negative affect-like behaviors, as determined by the forced swim test.

However, most of the identified sampling algorithms in the circuit are still simpler than the nonlinear circuit dynamics. Through comprehensive theoretical analyses of the nonlinear circuit dynamics, we discover the canonical circuit dynamics innately implements natural gradient Bayesian sampling, which is an advanced sampling algorithm that adaptively adjusts the sampling step size based on the local geometry of stimulus posteriors measured by Fisher information. Specifically, the nonlinear circuit dynamics can implement natural gradient Langevin and Hamiltonian sampling of uni- and multi-variate stimulus posteriors, and these algorithms can be switched by interneurons. We also find that the non-equilibrium circuit dynamics when transitioning from the resting to evoked state can further accelerate natural gradient sampling, and analytically identify the neural circuit's annealing strategy. Remarkably, we identify the approximated computational strategies employed in the circuit dynamics, which even resemble the ones widely used in machine learning. Our work provides an overarching connection between canonical circuit dynamics and advanced sampling algorithms, deepening our understanding of the circuit algorithms of Bayesian sampling.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

To address this relationship and to explore antibody responses against the microbiota, we isolated bacteria from duodenal biopsies and assessed antibody reactivity. Systemic IgA showed reactivity to bacteria of the upper gastrointestinal tract with a preference for binding Neisseria species, while duodenal IgA showed broader reactivity. We found limited clonal overlap between gut and bone marrow plasma cells of individual donors, yet a few shared clones specific to bacterial antigens were identified. Despite showing clonal overlap, gut and bone marrow plasma cells have distinct IgA subclass distributions, and they likely depend on B-cell activation at discrete anatomical sites.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated whether and how the inflammatory environment in sJIA versus JIA synovial fluid (SF) may differentially impact T helper (Th) cell polarization and activation. Methods: SF samples from sJIA and JIA patients (both n=7) were tested in various cell culture setups, with or without recombinant cytokines or cytokine-blocking drugs, to assess their effects on healthy donor Th cell activation. We analyzed cellular surface marker, transcription factor, and effector molecule expression using flow cytometry, Luminex, ELISA, and qRT-PCR. Results: Both sJIA and JIA SF revealed highly pro-inflammatory profiles. Compared to JIA, sJIA SF demonstrated markedly elevated IL-1{beta}, IL-18, GM-CSF, S100A9, and MPO levels, while JIA SF showed trends toward higher soluble FasL and IL-17A concentrations. Notably, sJIA SF significantly increased CD4 T cell ICOS expression and expanded CXCR3posCCR6pos Th cells, whereas JIA SF favored expansion of CXCR3negCCR6pos Th cells and CCR6pos Th cell expansion was sensitive to IL-1 blockade. Systemic JIA SF selectively sustained a IFN{gamma}/IL-21 expressing T peripheral helper (Tph) phenotype, particularly associated with IL-1{beta}, IL-18, and GM-CSF SF levels. Spiking JIA SF with a cocktail of these cytokines recapitulated some T cellular phenotypic features observed in sJIA SF cultures. Conclusion: JIA and sJIA SF drive distinct Th cell polarization, including differential and sustained Tf/ph cell activation. These findings complement our earlier observations in sJIA peripheral blood and demonstrate the impact of the SF inflammatory matrix on immune cell activation.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

By examining gene expression responses along a natural temperature gradient in Chironomus riparius, we challenged this view. We found that the vast majority of expressed genes (63%) exhibit dynamic CGV, where interindividual expression variability scales continuously with distance from the selectively optimal temperature, a pattern also observed in higher-level traits like mutation rate and ROS levels. Genes with lower overall expression levels were less temperature-regulated, and thermal reaction norm shapes varied with gene function. Unexpectedly, thermally plastic genes were more pleiotropic, often acting as hub genes, while CGV in gene expression was associated with lower pleiotropy. This pattern, and the observed strong recurrent selection on plastic genes with CGV, aligns with C. riparius's adaptation to its highly fluctuating environment through selective tracking. We propose that this continuous, dynamic release of genetic variation is a necessary and inherent outcome of the polygenic nature of traits. This model fundamentally reshapes our understanding of adaptation, implying that populations can gradually and continuously adapt without requiring harsh conditions to expose hidden diversity. This leads to smoother adaptive landscapes, enhancing rapid adaptation and facilitating evolutionary innovation in the face of ongoing environmental change.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Here we address these challenges with a rapid physics-based computational method to generate isosteric and chemically complementary binding pockets for small-molecule targets in de novo designed proteins. We test this experimentally by constructing and characterizing binding proteins for several synthetic and natural chromophores. By evaluating only single-digit numbers of designs, the pipeline delivers stable proteins with pre-organized binding sites confirmed by X-ray crystallography, which bind the targets selectively with micromolar affinities or better.

RAD18 is also frequently overexpressed and pathologically activated in cancer cells. However, the extent to which RAD18 shapes cancer genomes and impacts tumorigenesis is unclear. Therefore, we tested the effect of Rad18 status on chemically-induced and oncogene-driven tumorigenesis. In a chemically-induced oral carcinogenesis model, acute (2-16 days) 4NQO-treatment induces expression of Rad18 and TLS polymerase mRNAs in mouse oral epithelial cells prior to emergence of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). Chronic (8 week) 4NQO-treatment leads to onset of oral tumors that is accelerated in Rad18-/- mice when compared with Rad18+/+ animals. Analysis of OSCC genomes reveals increased levels of G(C)>T(A) transversions in Rad18-/- tumors when compared with Rad18+/+. Therefore, Rad18 promotes error-free bypass of 4NQO-induced DNA lesions and suppresses 4NQO-induced oral carcinogenesis. In a KrasG12D-induced lung carcinogenesis model, Rad18-deficiency did not affect rates or incidence of oncogene-induced lung tumors or mutations. Taken together, we demonstrate that Rad18 has context-specific tumor-suppressive activity.

To ensure rapid and accurate DNA replication during S-phase, the cell uses so-called DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways to bypass this damage, leaving lesions to be repaired after completion of replication. One established DDT pathway is Translesion Synthesis (TLS), in which lesions are bypassed by specialized TLS Polymerases that work in conjunction with the replisome. Here, we demonstrate that DNA Polymerase alpha (Pol ), the primase/polymerase holoenzyme that primes daughter templates during DNA replication, can also unexpectedly function as a TLS polymerase in vitro. We use biochemical and single-molecule fluorescence assays as well as yeast genetics to characterize the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) TLS activity of Pol . The results indicate that Pol  can robustly bypass CPD lesions with its native polymerase activity and without misincorporation of ribonucleotides. We demonstrate with single-molecule Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) that the DNA binding cleft of Pol  may remain open to accommodate a bulky CPD lesion during TLS. However, we also show that overexpression of Pol  in vivo cannot rescue UV sensitivity of a TLS knockout strain lacking all three natively expressed TLS Pols. We further observe that the single-stranded binding protein, RPA, as well as Pols {epsilon} and {delta} each inhibit Pol  CPD TLS activity. Conversely, these replisome components do not inhibit and can even stimulate Pol , the canonical TLS Pol for CPD lesions. The results suggest that, during normal replication, the intrinsic TLS activity of Pol  is likely suppressed at the replication fork by the replisome itself.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Initially, static tunicate culture yielded exponential growth in contrast to the RAS system, which yielded poor survival and negligible growth. Modifications were made to the RAS system to improve water treatment proficiency that greatly improved tunicate survival and growth. Experiments were performed isolating feed and water type as variables that differed between the static and RAS systems to evaluate their effects. A live feed combination achieved five-fold greater growth relative to a commercial concentrate diet. B. schlosseri maintained in optimized RAS water achieved two-fold faster growth relative to animals maintained with freshly prepared artificial seawater indicating that the RAS water was beneficial to the animals. Feeding frequency of the RAS system was increased from three times per week to daily. The RAS system and procedural modifications resulted in comparable growth rates in the static and RAS systems.

Using Staphylococcus aureus as a model, we found that gene transfer via various mechanisms is significantly restricted between strains from different clonal complexes (CCs), with the notable exception of lateral transduction, which occurs at high frequency. Interestingly, some strains exhibited a promiscuous ability to accept diverse mobile genetic elements. These strains were defective in the key immune defences of S. aureus, specifically the Type I restriction-modification systems that normally protect against foreign DNA. A broader analysis revealed that such immune-deficient mutants are widespread within S. aureus populations. Our study uncovered a trade-off that explains their persistence in nature: although these mutants are more susceptible to phage attack, they gain an evolutionary advantage by acquiring beneficial genes - such as those conferring antibiotic resistance - which enhance survival under selective pressure. These immune-deficient cells act as gateways for foreign DNA, which, once integrated and advantageous, can spread within the same CC.

M.; Dekoninck, K.; Min, K.-Y.; Traxler, M. F.", "abstract": "Conservons are regulatory systems found in bacteria of the phylum Actinomycetota. These regulatory systems are composed of four core proteins: a sensor histidine kinase-like protein (CvnA homolog), an MglA-type roadblock protein (CvnB homolog), a protein containing a domain of unknown function (CvnC homolog), and small Ras-like GTPase (CvnD homolog). Based on their conserved small GTPase components and their phylogenetic distribution, we propose that conservons should be known as Actinobacterial Gprotein systems (AGPSs). The signal transduction path through AGPSs remains poorly understood, and some AGPSs have additional accessory proteins (CvnE and CvnF homologs) of unknown function. In this work, we show that AGPS accessory proteins are present when the cognate histidine kinase protein (CvnA homolog) lacks an extracytoplasmic sensory domain. It was previously shown that the Cvn8 AGPS of Streptomyces coelicolor controls expression of multiple pathways for specialized metabolism and that the Cvn8 AGPS contains an accessory protein, CvnF8. Through protein modeling, we found that CvnF8 may share an interaction interface with the histidine kinase CvnA8, prompting the hypothesis that CvnF8 may serve as a modulator of CvnA8 activity. We found that in a purified system, CvnF8 strongly stimulated the ATPase activity and autophosphorylation of CvnA8.

The mechanisms of how these nematodes associate with environmental microbes other than their Xenorhabdus symbionts is barely known. Here, we report a new mechanism of E. coli Nissle (EcN) association with the nematode Steinernema hermaphroditum. We show that EcN cells are enclosed and lysed in at least four pairs of coelomocytes, suggesting these immune cells respond to bacterial invasion. During the IJ stage of nematode development, EcN cells localize to posterior intestinal vacuoles and enter the inter-cuticular space, where they proliferate, aggregate, then lyse. EcN cells expressed proteins in the cell lysates were maintained in the nematode cuticle over eight weeks in non-sterile soil.

Spirochaetes are widely distributed, ancient bacteria found in diverse environments, offering a unique opportunity to explore ecological transitions. Despite their high diversity and the presence of globally important pathogens such as syphilis (Treponema spp.), Lyme disease (Borrelia spp.), or leptospirosis (Leptospira spp.), Spirochaetes remain poorly characterized as a phylum. Moreover, the recent discovery of non-spiral lineages has broadened its complexity and require a re-evaluation of the entire phylum s evolution. Here, we present the most comprehensive phylogenomic and functional analysis of Spirochaetes, examining a curated dataset of 172 spirochaetal genomes representing all cultivable spirochete species. Our robust phylogenetic framework revisits the evolutionary rooting of this phylum and reveals that the Last Spirochaetal Common Ancestor (LSCA) diverged into two major clades, with Brachyspira species diverging early from the rest of Spirochaetes. Ancestral genome reconstruction showed that the LSCA was a motile, endoflagellated bacterium with a heterotrophic metabolism, shedding light on the biology of one of the most anciently diverging bacterial phyla. Functional analysis revealed genomic signatures associated with key phenotypic adaptations within Spirochaetes, such as independent loss of the characteristic spiral morphology and emergence of host-associated lineages. Notably, we found that loss of endoflagellar genes correlated with the appearance of non-spiral species. Lastly, we employed phylogenetic profiling to identify previously uncharacterized motility-associated gene families, whose role was then demonstrated experimentally.

Integrative analysis of the data identified ZFHX4 as a prominent super-enhancer-controlled TF induced in mDAN differentiation. ZFHX4 has been associated with neurodevelopmental processes in several species and shows reduced expression in midbrain of PD patients. Using in vitro knockdown (KD) and overexpression experiments, we show that ZFHX4 is necessary but not sufficient for mDAN differentiation. ZFHX4 binds preferentially at active promoter regions and transcriptomic analysis upon ZFHX4 depletion during mDAN differentiation revealed putative primary target genes to be enriched for targets of cell-cycle-related TFs and pathways. Consistently, ZFHX4-depleted cells accumulated in G2-phase of the cell cycle, preventing normal cell cycle progression and exit.

Overall, our results show that the perturbing effect of mutations is highly partner-specific and depends on the dynamic rearrangements of both uniformly occurring and ligand-specific residue-residue interactions.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Using DNA metabarcodes, many taxa can be identified from a single sample simultaneously, but annotating these sequences with species-level taxonomy often requires more information than short-read sequences afford. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing has achieved species-level resolution in metabarcoding of bacteria and invertebrates, but complex fungal taxonomy and biology has been a hurdle to the application of this technology for Fungi. In this work, we use a mock community of real ONT long-read metabarcodes from 54 fungi from the Dikarya subkingdom to extensively benchmark classification approaches to assign species-level taxonomy. We compare eight classification approaches spanning alignment and k-mer based algorithms, to emerging machine learning methods, and assess the sensitivity, precision, and diversity estimation of each classifier at the species level. Our results indicate that classifiers which determine informed thresholds of sequence similarity based on a provided reference database are not only more accurate at the species level, but more consistent to correct species abundance distributions, and better able to place sequences from \"unknown\" species taxonomically closer to their true origin. We demonstrate the power of machine learning classifiers to leverage long-read metabarcodes, and their promise as emerging methods in DNA sequence classification. We present our results in the context of real-world use cases, to demonstrate that species-level taxonomic inference is achievable, precise, and reliable with ONT long-read fungal metabarcodes.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the mechanisms regulating gamete release in the ascidian Ciona robusta, part of the sister group of vertebrates. Ciona is a hermaphrodite, releasing sperm first from orange-pigmented organ (OPO) at the end of the spermiduct, followed by eggs from the oviduct beneath the spermiduct knob-like structure. In this study, behavioral and morphological analyses revealed that this sequential release occurs because the knob-like structure compresses the oviduct opening at the onset of gamete release. Observations of transgenic Ciona expressing Kaede under the gonadotropin-releasing hormone 2 (Gnrh2) promoter showed that Gnrh2-expressing neurons and fibers accumulate in the epithelium around the spermiduct openings. In contrast, Gnrh1-expressing neurons are localized in the cerebral ganglion and project toward the ovary, suggesting distinct roles of GnRH1 and GnRH2 in reproductive regulation. RNA-seq and real-time PCR analyses revealed that Opsin2, Opsin3, beta-carotene-15,15'-monooxygenase (Bco), and several ion channel genes are specifically expressed in the OPO, along with Gnrh2. In situ hybridization showed that these genes are localized in the innermost OPO layer, suggesting that the OPO functions as a photoreceptive organ. Although, Gnrh2 expression has been considered low in adult Ciona, our study revealed strong OPO-specific expression with photoreceptive genes. Collectively, these findings suggest that GnRH2 plays a central role in gamete release regulation, potentially in coordination with the photoreceptive system, while GnRH1 may regulate ovarian functions. These results indicate that C. robusta employs distinct GnRH systems in a tissue-specific manner to regulate reproduction.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Pathogenic variants in PGM1 cause PGM1-congenital disorder of glycosylation (PGM1-CDG), a multisystem disorder with cardiac involvement. While glycosylation abnormalities in PGM1-CDG are treatable with galactose, cardiomyopathy does not improve suggesting a glycosylation-independent pathomechanism. Recently, mitochondrial abnormalities have been shown in a heart of a PGM1-deficicient patient and PGM1-mouse model. In addition, PGM1 has been associated with LDB3 (ZASP/Cypher), a sarcomeric Z-disk protein also associated with cardiomyopathy. However, the cardiac-specific role of PGM1 remains poorly understood, and targeted therapies for PGM1-related cardiomyopathy are currently lacking. Methods Induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iCMs) were generated from PGM1-deficient patient fibroblasts. Multielectrode array (MEA) recordings, untargeted (glyco)proteomics, and pathway analysis were performed to assess functional and molecular changes. Key findings were validated using tracer metabolomics and mitochondrial respiration assays. Results PGM1-deficient iCMs exhibited reduced beating frequency, impaired contractility, and prolonged contraction kinetics. Proteomic analyses revealed depletion of Z-disk components, including LDB3. AlphaFold3 structural modeling predicted a direct interaction between PGM1 and LDB3, implicating PGM1 in Z-disk integrity, which was confirmed in vitro. In addition, mitochondrial proteins were severely depleted, prompting us to investigate mitochondrial function. Functional validation confirmed extensive metabolic rewiring, energy depletion, and severely impaired mitochondrial respiration. Finally, the in silico drug repurposing identified possible therapeutic options that could target PGM1-deficient cardiomyopathy. Conclusion PGM1 is a key regulator of cardiomyocyte function, linking sarcomeric Z-disk integrity with mitochondrial metabolism. These mechanistic insights offer a foundation for developing targeted therapies for PGM1-CDG and potentially other cardiomyopathies involving Z-disk dysfunction.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

PARP1/2 enzymes transfer the ADP-ribosyl moiety from NAD+ to DNA damage proteins, histones and to itself, activating the DNA repair cascade. Recent studies have shown that Histone PARylation Factor (HPF1) forms a joint active site with the catalytic domain of PARP1/2 and alters their target modification site from glutamate/aspartate towards serine. In this work, we have identified key serine residues within the N-terminus of full-length PARP2 that are the main targets of PARP1/2 automodification. We demonstrated this using site-directed mutagenesis, gel-based PARylation assays of automodification reactions, and by measuring the release of PARP2 from the DNA damage site using a fluorescence polarization assay. We show that in the presence of HPF1, PARP2 serine 8 and serine 73 are predominantly ADP-ribosylated and serine 8, which is present in both human PARP2 isoforms, is the major site for PARP2 automodification.

E.; Jiang, Z.; Karandur, D.; Applebaum Licht, A. T.; Shah, N. H.", "abstract": "Dysregulation of the phosphatase SHP2 is implicated in various diseases, including congenital disorders and cancer. SHP2 contains two phosphotyrosine-recognition domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2) and a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domain. The N-SH2 domain is critical for SHP2 regulation. In the auto-inhibited state, it binds to the PTP domain and blocks the active site, but phosphoprotein engagement destabilizes the N-SH2/PTP domain interaction, thereby exposing the active site. Many disease mutations in SHP2 are at the N-SH2/PTP interface, and they hyperactivate SHP2 by disrupting auto-inhibitory interactions. The activating E139D mutation represents an exception to this mechanism, as it resides in the C-SH2 domain and makes minimal interactions in auto-inhibited and active state crystal structures. In this study, using AlphaFold2 modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we identify an alternative active conformation of SHP2, in which Glu139 interacts with Arg4 and Arg5 on the N-SH2 domain to stabilize a novel N-SH2/C-SH2 interface. Using double mutant cycles, we show that this active state is further stabilized by the E139D mutation and is dependent on Arg5. Finally, we demonstrate that the E139D mutation enforces an active conformation with distinct phosphoproteins binding preferences from canonical hyperactive mutants.

Heteromeric hERG1a/1b ion channels, essential for maintaining normal cardiac rhythm, assemble via cotranslational association of their encoding mRNAs. We hypothesized that direct hERG1a and 1b mRNA interactions facilitate this process. Using fluorescence colocalization and free energy of binding predictions, we found that hERG1a and 1b mRNAs form specific heterotypic condensates in vitro, suggesting direct interactions. When hERG1a mRNA was altered by synonymous mutations predicted to reduce its structural diversity and ability to interact with other mRNAs, overlap with hERG1b was dramatically diminished both in vitro and in cells, indicating weakened interactions. Reducing hERG1a structural diversity also influenced its translational complexes, defined by overlapping between fluorescently labeled mRNA and encoded protein (centroids within 400 nm). Whereas most of the wild-type hERG1a mRNA translates within heterotypic complexes, likely reflecting the biogenesis of hERG1a/1b heteromeric assemblies, reducing hERG1a structural diversity yielded more homotypic translational condensates and fewer hERG1a/1b heterotypic ones. This result suggests that the strength of mRNA interactions impact ion channel biogenesis. Further analysis of the heterotypic translational complexes revealed two distinct classes: a) simultaneous translation of both subunits and b) sequential association of fully translated hERG1b with translating hERG1a. Notably, reducing hERG1a structural diversity and interactions with 1b shifted translation toward the sequential mode. These findings identify a new role of mRNA sequence, structure, and interactions in orchestrating the cotranslational association of important heteromeric membrane proteins.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

These proteins play a crucial role in host cell interactions and exhibit dynamic behaviors, such as tilting, sliding, and clustering, which vary across different types of enveloped viruses. For instance, SARS-CoV-2 spikes tilt to facilitate receptor binding, Influenza spikes migrate during infection, and HIV spikes migrate and cluster to enhance infectivity. In this study, we investigate how such dynamics influence the virus mobility. We characterize viral mobility through translational and rotational diffusion coefficients using a mesoscopic model that incorporates the dynamics of both the flexible spike proteins and the viral envelope. Using the smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) method, we construct three virion models with varying spike flexibility. The first is a fully rigid virus with static spikes, the second is a model with spikes that tilt but remain fixed in position, and the third is a model allowing both tilting and sliding of spikes across the envelope. Our results show that spike flexibility primarily affects rotational diffusion, whereas the envelope dominates translational mobility of the virus. We also explore spike. clustering driven purely by hydrodynamic interactions. We identify that hydrodynamic interactions alone can be responsible for dynamic clustering of spike proteins. Where, the characteristic size and lifespan of such clusters indicate predominantly doublets and triplets formations.

This study presents a mechanobiological model to investigate how ECE viscosity modulates cancer cell migration by regulating some key processes, including actin polymerization, retrograde flow, and adhesion adaptations. Our results reveal a biphasic response: a moderate increase in ECE viscosity enhances actin filament network density and adhesion strength, thereby accelerating migration, whereas excessively high viscosity hinders movement due to too large mechanical resistance. Furthermore, we identify a short-term migration memory phenomenon, where cancer cells exposed to high viscosity environments retain elevated migration speeds after transitioning to low viscosity conditions. This memory effect is sustained by the continued assembly of cytoskeletal proteins such as actin monomers and Arp2/3.

Previously [Roy et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 52, 13, 2024, 7447-7464], we showed that the motif VI loop (VIL) in WNV NS3h functions as a nucleotide valve, regulating ADP affinity during hydrolysis.

Using microsecond-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of hydrolysis-cycle intermediates, we find that key VIL residues (R461, R464) correlate strongly with RNA phosphate affinity of motif V. Structural analyses reveal an ATP-sensitive interaction between E413 (motif V) and R461 (motif VIL) that modulates the conformation of the motif V 310-helix, thereby influencing RNA binding.

While it is usually assumed that the first phase is rate- and the second is concentration-dependent, there are no detailed investigations into the rate-sensitivity of the first phase. We performed dynamic perifusion studies with isolated human pancreatic islets in a system that allowed fully customizable glucose ramps and established the corresponding insulin secretion time-profiles with high (once-a-minute) time-resolution. We considered the first-phase release to be the excess amount of insulin in addition to what would be expected from the glucose concentration-dependent second-phase release and examined its dependence on the glucose gradient (rate of increase). The average first-phase insulin release rate calculated this way increased with the gradient and could be fitted well with a Hill-type sigmoid function having a half-maximal value around 1.25 mM/min (nHill=1.8, r2=0.96). This agrees well with our previously introduced glucose-insulin control system built on a general framework of a sigmoid proportional-integral-derivative ({sigma}PID) controller, a generalized PID controller more suitable for biological systems than classic linear ones as biological responses are always limited between zero and a possible maximum. Experimental results obtained here were used to slightly readjust the parameters of this local glucose concentration-based computational model resulting in predictions in good agreement with measured first- and second-phase insulin secretions (r2>0.90). Thus, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) of perifused human islets can be described well as the sum of a rate-sensitive first phase, which is a sigmoid function of the glucose gradient with half-maximal value around 1.25 mM/min, and a concentration-sensitive second phase, which is a sigmoid function of the glucose concentration with half-maximal value around 8 mM.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

Using live-cell reporters and smFISH in in vitro inducing environments, we identify bimodal expression of SPI-2 in clonal populations. We show cells progressively transition into a SPI-2 expressing state, with multi-generational variation in the timing at which this transition occurs. The rate of these single-cell transitions are modulated by the strength of intracellular-like signals and environmental manipulations of growth rate. We determine that heterogeneity originates at the level of sensor kinase SsrA signaling and is dependent on response regulator SsrB concentration. We identify switch-like dynamics in SPI-2 activation and link single-cell responses to features of cell growth and lineage. Combined, our results show that the fraction of cells expressing SPI-2 in a given timeframe is probabilistically tuned to the likelihood they are experiencing an intracellular environment, a strategy that resolves uncertainty in ambiguous environments.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

While host-gut microbiota interactions are well-characterized in homeotherms, these relationships remain poorly understood in poikilotherms during sexual differentiation. We examined gut microbiota dynamics across developmental stages in the shortfin eel Anguilla bicolor pacifica, which exhibits early sexual differentiation and a relatively short life cycle. Glass eels were cultivated in controlled freshwater conditions for three years, with sampling at key stages: glass eel, elver, sex-undetermined eel, and sex-determined eel. Full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed significant compositional shifts during development, with higher bacterial richness in adults versus younger eels. Early stages were dominated by Pseudomonadota, while sex-determined adults showed increased Deinococcota abundance. Network analysis identified Deinococcus, Sphingomonas, and Variovorax as key genera in sex-determined eels, with positive correlations between anti-Mullerian hormone gene expression and these taxa. We isolated 66 gut bacterial strains capable of metabolizing sex hormones under microaerobic conditions. These isolates, representing 22 genera across four phyla, demonstrated diverse metabolic capabilities from partial oxidation to complete steroid mineralization. Multiple strains achieved complete estradiol degradation as single isolates, a rare metabolic capability of environmental microorganisms. Comparative genomic analysis revealed widespread steroid-metabolizing genes, with Deinococcus species showing previously unreported hormone degradation capabilities. Our multi-omics analysis demonstrates that gut microbiota composition and function are intimately linked to eel sexual development, suggesting bidirectional host-microbe interactions influencing reproductive physiology. These findings advance understanding of host-microbiota interactions in aquatic vertebrates and provide implications for eel aquaculture and conservation.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

This has resulted in the accumulation of studies estimating the age-specific demographic transition rates across the tree of life over the last few decades. Although this accumulation of studies has enabled comparative demographic analyses to be developed, such analyses remain difficult to perform because age-specific data are scattered across literature. Here, we present a new open-access database, malddaba, which compiles age-specific demographic rates for mammals in the wild from published information. Currently, the database encompasses 170 species from 250 publications, representing 428 age- and sex-specific survival series and 199 age- and sex-specific reproduction series. Each series is reported using a standardized approach aimed at facilitating the extraction and use of that dataset by anyone interested in comparative biology. We show how malddaba can be used to address a variety of questions, ranging from comparative ageing with the assessment of actuarial and reproductive senescence patterns in a wide diversity of mammals. We can also address questions related to comparative population dynamics. For this purpose, in addition to the raw demographic rate records, we were able to build 43 population-specific life tables using malddaba records, which allow demographic outputs to be estimated accurately, such as population growth rate and generation time for those species. The malddaba database will be regularly updated to keep adding new demographic estimates and bring a comprehensive and dynamic view of the diversity of demographic trajectories across mammals.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Inferring the landscapes of mutation and recombination in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in the presence of twinning and hematopoietic chimerism", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.01.662565", "authors": "Soni, V.; Versoza, C. J.; Jensen, J. D.; Pfeifer, S. P.", "abstract": "The common marmoset is an important model in biomedical and clinical research, particularly for the study of age-related, neurodegenerative, and neurodevelopmental disorders (due to their biological similarities with humans), infectious disease (due to their susceptibility to a variety of pathogens), as well as developmental biology (due to their short gestation period relative to many other primates). Yet, despite being one of the most commonly used non-human primate models for research, the population genomics of the common marmoset remains relatively poorly characterized, despite the critical importance of this knowledge in many areas of research including genome-wide association studies, models of polygenic risk scores, and scans for the targets of selection. This neglect owes, at least in part, to two biological peculiarities related to the reproductive mode of the species - frequent twinning and sibling chimerism - which are likely to affect standard population genetic approaches relying on assumptions underlying the Wright-Fisher model. Using high-quality population genomic data, we here infer the rates and landscapes of mutation and recombination - two fundamental processes dictating the levels and patterns of genetic variability - in the presence of these biological features and discuss our findings in light of recent work in primates. Our results suggest that, while the species exhibits relatively low neutral mutation rates, rates of recombination are in the range of those observed in other anthropoids. Moreover, the recombination landscape of common marmosets, like that of many vertebrates, is dominated by PRDM9-mediated hotspots, with artificial intelligence-based models predicting an intricate 3D-structure of the species-specific PRDM9-DNA binding complex in silico. Apart from providing novel insights into the population genetics of common marmosets, given the importance of the availability of fine-scale maps of mutation and recombination for evolutionary inference, this work will also serve as a valuable resource to aid future genomic research in this widely studied system.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}

C.; Neff, T.; Qian, Q.; Asghari, A.; Wang, Z.; Zhang, Z.; Li, M.; Hao, M.; Lira, V.; Sun, H.; Potthoff, M. J.; Yang, L.", "abstract": "Aging-associated decline in brown adipose tissue (BAT) function and mass contributes to energy and metabolic homeostasis disruption. Alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5) is a major denitrosylase that prevents cellular nitro-thiol redox imbalance, an essential feature of aging. However, the functional significance of BAT ADH5 in the context of aging is largely unknown. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of BAT ADH5 in protecting against age-related metabolic dysfunction. We show that aging promotes aberrant BAT protein S-nitrosylation modification and downregulates ADH5 in mice. Furthermore, BAT ADH5-deletion accelerates BAT senescence and aging-associated declines in metabolic homeostasis and cognition. Mechanistically, we found that aging inactivates BAT Adh5 by suppressing heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a well-recognized proteostasis regulator. Moreover, pharmacologically enhancing HSF1 improved BAT senescence, metabolic decline, and cognitive dysfunction in aged mice. Together, these findings suggest that the BAT HSF1-ADH5 signaling cascade plays a key role in protecting against age-related systemic functional decline. Ultimately, unraveling the role of thermogenic adipose nitrosative signaling will provide novel insights into the interplay between BAT nitric oxide activity and metabolism in the context of aging.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Of Shared Homes and Pathways: Free-Ranging Dog Movement and Habitat Use in a Human-Wildlife Landscape in India", "doi": "10.1101/2025.06.30.662475", "authors": "Kuruppath, S. V.; Chatterjee, N.; Krishnamurthy, R.", "abstract": "Background: Free-ranging dogs are widely considered to potentially have negative impacts on wildlife in shared landscapes. Understanding their use of these landscapes is therefore essential to develop effective management strategies in wildlife-adjacent regions. In this study, we investigated the movement patterns of free-ranging dogs in the protected area matrix of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in Southern India. Methods: Fifteen dogs were collared from two adjacent villages with different levels of human habitation. We hypothesized that increased settlement cover would provide dogs with a greater human shield effect, allowing them more freedom of movement. We estimated dog activity ranges using autocorrelated kernel density estimates (AKDE) and characterized broad-scale movement through metrics including intensity of space use and mean distance from home. We then compared these metrics with respect to different variables to clarify underlying drivers of movement patterns. Lastly, we analysed fine-scale habitat selection using integrated step selection analysis (iSSA). Results: We found that free-ranging dogs in MTR have small activity ranges, with the mean AKDE activity range being 9.88 ha (median = 6.09 ha, SD = 7.69 ha, range 3.28-26.16 ha), and primarily utilise the area within 500m of their homes. No movement metric varied significantly with respect to any variable apart from intensity of use, which varied significantly between villages, indicating the dogs in the village with less human settlement restricted their movement more. iSSA revealed that dogs did not select for any specific habitat type other than human settlements and mostly moved within human settled or human-modified spaces, moving significantly faster in forest land than in any other habitat. Conclusions: These findings support the human shield hypothesis and highlight the role of human land use in shaping the movement of domestic dogs, in turn mediating potential effects of dogs on wildlife. Our study shows that dogs show plasticity in space use even at fine scales of 5km or less, which has important implications for management strategies that aim to curb dog movement.", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}
{"title": "The effect of environmental enrichment on immune cell DNA methylation profiles depends on the parity of sows.", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.01.662510", "authors": "Lopes, M. M.; Monteiro Moreira, G. C.; Chaulot-Talmon, A.; Frambourg, A.; Costes, V.; Demars, J.; MERLOT, E.; JAMMES, H.", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to identify epigenetic markers that reflected positive affective states in multiparous pregnant sows. The animals were housed during gestation in either a conventional (C) environment (2.4 square meter per sow), featuring a concrete slatted floor and minimal enrichment, or in an enriched (E) environment (3.5 m square meter per sow) with deep straw bedding. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated at day 98 of gestation (G98) and day 12 of lactation (L12) for genomic DNA extraction and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Significant effects of individual class of parity (low-parity (LP) versus high-parity (HP)) were observed with the identification of 1,358 and 680 differentially methylated cytosines (DMCs) at G98 and L12, respectively. Interestingly, some of them are organized into differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Some DMRs colocalized with or near a gene and displayed a continuous methylation distribution (44 at G98 and 15 at L12 including 4 in common): 5 targeted genes are related to epigenetic regulation (DNMT3A, KDM8, HDAC4, SIRT2 and U2) and 12 to immune function (CD2, CD5, CAMK4, SECTM1, URODL1, CMIP, SEC14L1, SKI, TNFRSF1B, CCND3, SGK1, PACS1). These results suggested a true epigenetic impact of parity class on individual immunity. Considering the two parity classes separately, a minor effect of environmental enrichment was observed (at G98: 60 and 42 DMCs; at L12: 35 and 81 DMCs, in the LP and HP groups, respectively). Remarkably, some DMC-associated genes had previously been linked to affective states in humans. In conclusion, unexpected DNA methylation changes associated with parity class were identified, suggesting a genome adaptation during reproductive life and modifying the response to housing conditions. Furthermore, specific CpG sites emerged as potential biomarkers of positive affective states in pigs. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home - PRJEB90105 / ERP173119 https://doi.org/10.57745/0GWNEV - Recherche Data Gouv. and referenced under MERLOT, Elodie; JAMMES, Helene, 2025, \"BEPPI project - data, tables and figures on sow peripheral white blood cell epigenome\".", "date": "2025-07-04", "journal": ""}
