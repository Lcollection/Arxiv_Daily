C.", "abstract": "Droplet coarsening is a long-standing phenomenon widely observed in our daily life and industrial processes. This process is typically governed by classic theories, such as Brownian motion-induced coalescence and Ostwald ripening, predicting continuous and rapid droplet growth. However, recent studies revealed that nanoscale biomolecular condensates, formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), often defy this expectation, exhibiting remarkable long-term stability in cells and in vitro systems. Here, we reveal a merging-limited coarsening mechanism that underpins this anomalously slow growth. Using experiments, theory, and simulations, we demonstrate that nanoscale coacervates formed at neutral stoichiometry remain stable over extended periods due to size-dependent merging inefficiency. This inefficiency stems from entropic charge separation caused by asymmetric chain lengths of oppositely charged polymers, which induces interfacial charge accumulation and inter-coacervate electrostatic repulsion. Our findings reframe LLPS as a kinetically constrained process evolving over a rugged energy landscape, in which merging barriers trap condensates in metastable, long-lived states. This framework offers a physical basis for condensate size control in cells and a design principle for stable synthetic biomolecular assemblies.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

The underlying mechanisms can be quite distinct from the ones operating at earlier stages of trait innovation. In this work, we have developed the compost yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus, which diverged from its closest relative >20 million years ago, as a model for interspecies comparative biology and genomics. We applied a battery of growth assays to species of the Kluyveromyces genus and found that K. marxianus outperformed its relatives in a battery of heat and chemical stress conditions. We then generated and analyzed genomes from across the genus, to find derived genetic features associated with, and potentially causal for, K. marxianus traits. We found robust expansions in gene families in the K. marxianus genome, most notably among genes annotated as transmembrane transporters and in metabolism. In molecular-evolution tests, we identified adaptive protein variants at hundreds of genes, among which plasma membrane transporters were over-represented. Together, these signals enable a model for the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary pressures underlying K. marxianus traits, including gains in transporter function mediating stress resistance, and metabolic variants contributing to its capacity for rapid growth in challenging conditions. Such oligogenic architectures may be the rule rather than the exception in phenotypes that have evolved over long timescales.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Filling such gaps can contribute to understanding how diverse body shapes arise from differential deployment of conserved signaling pathways. Here, we examined where conserved pathways are deployed in tardigrades, a panarthropod phylum with miniaturized, segmented bodies. Results: We used in situ mRNA detection in the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris to reveal expression patterns of FGF and BMP signaling pathway components during body segmentation and early mesoderm development. Among the patterns examined, we found an FGF ligand and receptor expressed near each other in segmentally iterated regions of ectoderm and endomesoderm, respectively. We also found a BMP ligand and antagonist expressed in dorsoventrally-restricted patterns in the lateral ectoderm. Conclusions: The detected patterns suggested specific hypotheses for further research: possible FGF signaling between ectoderm and endomesoderm, and possible roles of BMP signaling in dorsal-ventral patterning of lateral ectoderm. We compared our results with published expression patterns for FGF and BMP pathways across panarthropods, to contribute to previous hypotheses for how the development of segments and mesoderm may have evolved in the emergence of this clade of diversly-shaped animals.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

These condensates contain cis-regulatory elements (CREs), including enhancers and promoters, that are thought to regulate genes in the same condensate. The roles of condensates are of great current interest, but research into their function is limited by an inability to comprehensively identify their associated CREs. Here, we present a conceptual framework and algorithm, BOUQUET, for integrating genome topology, chromatin occupancy, and graph theory to associate CREs and transcription protein machinery with target genes and identify exceptionally protein-rich communities that interact with condensates. BOUQUET uncovers surprising quantitative correlations between community protein accumulation and gene expression phenotypes by combining accurate CRE-gene assignment with co-activator binding profiles. A small subset of communities, which we call \"3D-super-enhancers,\" is exceptionally protein-rich. BOUQUET-predicted 3D-SEs are comparable in number to co-activator nuclear puncta, and all genes known to interact with co-activator condensates in embryonic stem cells are within 3D-SEs. 3D-SEs are enriched for association with cell identity genes across mammalian tissues. Microscopy analyses show frequent co-localization and co-expression of genes from the same 3D-SE within a single co-activator punctum, suggesting 3D-SE components interact with co-activator condensates. Thus 3D-SEs correspond to co-activator puncta, which nominates additional condensate-associated genes and CREs.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

PTCs may become highly aggressive anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATC). While single cell transcriptomics may resolve this heterogeneity, it is potentially confounded by technical effects whose correction may dampen inter-tumor variations. Here we profiled ATCs and BRAFV600E PTCs with single nuclei RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, and an experimental design disentangling biological and technical variations. It reveals that much transcriptional variation in cancer cells and several immune cell types is idiosyncratic, i.e. tumor-specific, a phenomenon obscured by batch integration in a number of single cell studies. Idiosyncrasies are associated in some cases with genomic aberrations and global tissue states like hypoxia. Beyond idiosyncrasies, differentiation markers SLC5A5 (NIS), TPO, TG and TSHR are lost in a sequence mirrored by their gain during human thyroid organoids maturation, suggesting a new classification of cancer cell states. PTC cells retain TSHR expression and show features of partial EMT with a massive expression of FN1, which promotes proliferation via an autocrine loop. In contrast, ATCs undergo full blown EMT, with expression of mesenchymal extracellular components and loss of TSHR. Finally, we show that the microenvironment of cancer cells is driven by inflammation. These findings may help future stratifications of BRAFV600E PTCs.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Despite its comparatively simple composition relative to other human microbiota systems, the mechanisms underpinning the dynamics and stability of vaginal microbial communities remain elusive. A crucial, yet so far underexplored, aspect of vaginal microbiota ecology is the role played by nutritional resources. Glycogen and its derivatives, produced by vaginal epithelia, are accessible to all bacterial constituents of the microbiota. Concurrently, free sialic acid and fucose offer supplementary nutritional resources to bacterial strains capable of cleaving them from glycans, which are structurally integral to mucus. Notably, bacteria adept at sialic acid exploitation are often correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and are frequently implicated in bacterial vaginosis (BV). In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical model tailored to human vaginal microbiota dynamics to explore the interactions between bacteria and their respective nutritional landscape. Our resource-based model examines the impact of the relative availability of glycogen derivatives (accessible to all bacterial species) and sialic acid (exclusive to some BV-associated bacteria) on the composition of the vaginal microbiota. Our findings elucidate that the success of BV-associated bacteria is intricately linked to their exclusive access to specific nutritional resources. This private access fortifies communities dominated by BV-associated bacteria, rendering them resilient to compositional transitions. We empirically corroborate our model prediction with longitudinal clinical data on microbiota composition and previously unpublished metabolomic profiles obtained from a North American cohort.

Many of the best-characterized denitrifiers are complete denitrifiers capable of executing all steps in the pathway, but whether they dominate in natural communities and what metabolic traits and environmental factors drive the global distribution of complete vs. partial denitrifiers remains to be determined. To address this, we conducted a comparative analysis of denitrification genes in 61,293 genomes, 3,991 metagenomes covering all major biomes, and 413 terrestrial and aquatic metatranscriptomes. We show that partial denitrifiers outnumber complete denitrifiers and the potential to initiate denitrification is more common than the potential to terminate it, both among genomes and at the community level across most biomes, particularly in nutrient rich environments. These patterns were also reflected in the metatranscriptomes. Our results further indicate that complete denitrifiers are more likely to be fast-growing organisms, favoring organic acid over sugar metabolism, and encoding the ability to oxidize and reduce a broader range of organic and inorganic compounds compared to partial denitrifiers. This suggests complete denitrifiers are metabolically flexible opportunists. Together, our results indicate an environmental footprint on the presence of denitrification genes which favors the genomic potential for partial over complete denitrification in most biomes and highlight that completion of the denitrification pathway is a community effort.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

This study highlights the critical role of treatment-holiday thresholds in adaptive therapy for tumors composed of drug-sensitive and resistant cells. Using a Lotka-Volterra model, adaptive therapy outcomes are compared with maximum tolerated dose therapy and intermittent therapy outcomes, showing that adaptive therapy success depends critically on the threshold for pausing and resuming treatment and on competitive interactions between cell populations. Three comparison scenarios between adaptive therapy and other therapies emerge: uniform-decline where adaptive therapy underperforms regardless of threshold, conditional-improve where efficacy requires threshold optimization, and uniform-improve where adaptive therapy consistently outperforms alternatives. Tumor composition including initial burden and resistant cell proportion influences outcomes. Threshold adjustments enable adaptive therapy to suppress resistant subclones while preserving sensitive cells, extending progression-free survival. Crucially, this work establishes an optimal control problem for time-to-progression and mathematically proves that under biological constraints like neutral competition or low initial burden, the theoretically optimal strategy is unrealizable as it requires infinitely many treatment holidays, rendering it clinically impractical.

E.; Ane, C.", "abstract": "F-statistics are commonly used to assess hybridization, admixture or introgression between populations or deeper evolutionary lineages. Using simulations, we find that network complexity had a large impact on the accuracy to infer the network structure from f statistics. Networks recovered accurately had one reticulation, or had their reticulations in \"large\" cycles of at least 4 nodes in all subnetworks. But accuracy was extremely poor to infer complex networks, in which a reticulation is part of a small cycle of only 3 nodes in some subnetwork. Accuracy also decreased with increasing number of reticulations and the network level. For these networks, accuracy was low even from large data sets with low mutation rate, under a molecular clock, and retaining many top-scoring graphs. Yet in all cases, the network's major tree was recovered reliably. When the molecular clock was violated, the f4-test tended to falsely detect the presence of reticulation in large data sets or under a high mutation rate. Rate variation also impacted network inference accuracy and increased the rate of falsely rejecting 1 reticulation as being adequate. We propose that identifiability, or lack thereof, is underlying the contrasting recoverability between simple and complex networks. Our findings suggest that the major tree is one feature that might be estimable from f-statistics. In practice, we recommend evaluating a large set of top-scoring networks inferred from f-statistics, and even so, using caution in assuming that the true network is part of this set.

Renal biopsies from affected patients revealed tubular damage, and puberulic acid was subsequently identified as a potential nephrotoxic contaminant. Recognizing the urgent need for a reliable in vitro nephrotoxicity testing platform, we hypothesized that a kidney organoid-based system could replicate nephrotoxic injury and help identify novel nephrotoxicants. In this study, we developed a screening model using kidney organoids derived from adult rat kidney stem (KS) cells and applied it to evaluate the toxicity of puberulic acid. Methods: Kidney organoids were generated from KS cells and exposed to established nephrotoxicants, including cisplatin and gentamicin, to validate the model. The nephrotoxicity of puberulic acid was evaluated using both KS cell-derived organoids and wild-type mice. Nephrotoxicity was assessed by morphological changes, Kim-1 mRNA expression, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and analysis of markers related to mitochondrial injury, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Results: The kidney organoids reproduced morphological features of injury induced by known nephrotoxins and showed significant upregulation of Kim-1 mRNA. Puberulic acid-treated organoids displayed ultrastructural features consistent with acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and increased Kim-1 expression. In vivo, puberulic acid-exposed mice exhibited impaired renal function and histological findings consistent with ATN. Both in vitro and in vivo models revealed mitochondrial structural abnormalities and reduced expression of cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX-IV). Additionally, oxidative stress and apoptotic markers, including 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and cleaved caspase-3, were significantly elevated, suggesting that puberulic acid induces mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, leading to tubular cell death. Conclusion: Puberulic acid-induced nephrotoxicity was demonstrated using our kidney organoid model.

However, if environmental variation influences the strength of latitudinal clines, then clinal patterns will be unstable, and using patterns of adaptation to predict population responses to global change will be difficult. To test whether environmental variation influences latitudinal clines, we sampled five populations of Drosophila melanogaster spanning 3000-km of east coast Australia, and measured stress tolerance (heat, cold and desiccation) and body size on flies that developed in six combinations of temperature (13{degrees}C, 25{degrees}C and 29{degrees}C) and diet (standard and low-calorie) treatments. We found latitudinal clines where populations further from the equator had larger wings, higher cold tolerance and lower heat tolerance. For all traits, temperature determined the strength of latitudinal clines, whereas diet had little influence. Steeper clines often emerged in warmer treatments, created by latitudinal clines in plasticity. In the warmest temperature, higher latitude populations showed larger increases in heat tolerance, larger reductions in desiccation tolerance but smaller decreases in cold tolerance. Heat tolerance was the only trait that supported the climate variability hypothesis and a trade-off between plasticity and tolerance. Environment-dependent latitudinal clines are therefore likely to determine variation in population responses to global change.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

However, this computational approach ignores the biological reality that ribosomes select start codons based on sequence context, not ORF length.

To replace the lost myocardium, resident cardiomyocytes (CMs) dedifferentiate and proliferate, invading the injured area. The response of the myocardium is preceded by the activation of the epicardium and endocardium, which form active scaffolds to provide mechanical and paracrine support to guide regeneration. New CMs use protrusions to migrate and invade fibrotic injured tissue, to replace it with functional myocardium. Here, we investigated the expression profile of the stress-responsive ankrd1a gene in different cardiac structures, at key time points during regeneration, aiming to gain insight into its precise roles during zebrafish heart regeneration. In the TgBAC(ankrd1a:EGFP) reporter line, transgene upregulation was restricted to the myocardium, initiated as early as 15 hours post-cryoinjury, and consistently marked CMs bordering the injury or scar area during regeneration. Transcriptome profiling and immunostaining revealed a potential role of ankrd1a in regulating CMs' dedifferentiation, as well as changes in expression of genes associated with antigen presentation and extracellular matrix composition in the ankrd1a mutant.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying its age-related upregulation remain poorly understood. Here, we examine how Cdc42 levels change over successive divisions in budding yeast, which undergoes asymmetric cell division, leading to aging predominantly in mother cells. Using microfluidics-based live-cell imaging and genetic analyses, we find that Cdc42 protein is unevenly distributed between mother and daughter cells during division. Notably, daughter cells inherit lower levels of Cdc42, which helps them rejuvenate. This asymmetry depends on Cdc42s association with endomembranes and requires the presence of farnesylated Ydj1, an Hsp40/DnaJ chaperone tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, maintaining proper Cdc42 levels relies on its interaction with Ydj1. These findings reveal a chaperone-mediated mechanism that controls Cdc42 partitioning during asymmetric division, linking it to cellular aging--a process that may be conserved in other asymmetrically dividing cells.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

By contrast, rodents and non-mammalian vertebrates only express the major transcript. Several rare variants of human OCA2 have been reported to be pathogenic due to increased exon 10 skipping. To understand the vulnerability of human OCA2 to exon 10 skipping and its impact on pigmentation, we first functionally tested a series of rare missense variants spread across exon 10. We found that each variant significantly influences the skipping ratio either positively or negatively. By combining human and murine sequences in functional assays, we found that the skipping ratio depends on particular exonic and intronic combinations. Next, we focused on the most frequent exonic single nucleotide variant of human OCA2, rs1800404-T (c.1065G>A/p.Ala355=), located in exon 10. We show that this variant significantly promotes exon 10 skipping on its own and exhibits an additive effect in cis to previously identified splicing variants likely contributing to their pathogenicity. Association studies reveal that rs1800404-T is tightly associated with lighter skin and hair pigmentation in a representative European population, as has been observed in other populations around the world. Our structural models of the skipped transcript-derived protein support causality by predicting that it could exert a dominant-negative effect, which is consistent with a dose-dependent hypopigmentation response in both pathological and physiological contexts. Overall, the modulation of OCA2 exon 10 skipping by both benign and pathogenic variants provides a basis for improving the genetic diagnosis of albinism, and paves the way for research into the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms behind human pigmentation diversity.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

J. H.", "abstract": "Objective: As artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into medical diagnostics, it is essential that predictive models provide not only accurate outputs but also reliable estimates of uncertainty. In clinical applications, where decisions have significant consequences, understanding the confidence behind each prediction is as critical as the prediction itself. Uncertainty modelling plays a key role in improving trust, guiding decision-making, and identifying unreliable outputs, particularly under dataset shift or in out-of-distribution settings. The primary aim of uncertainty metrics is to align model confidence closely with actual predictive performance, ensuring confidence estimates dynamically adjust to reflect increasing errors or decreasing reliability of predictions. This study investigates how different ensemble learning strategies affect both performance and uncertainty estimation in a clinically relevant task: classifying Normal, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Dementia from electroencephalography (EEG) data. Approach: We evaluated the performance and uncertainty of ensemble methods and Monte Carlo dropout on a large EEG dataset. Models are assessed in three settings: (1) in-distribution performance on a held-out test set, (2) generalisation to three out-of-distribution datasets, and (3) performance under gradual, EEG-specific dataset shifts simulating noise, drift, and frequency perturbation. Main results: Ensembles consisting of multiple independently trained models, such as deep ensembles, consistently achieved higher performance in both the in-distribution test set and the out-of-distribution datasets. These models also produced more informative and responsive uncertainty estimates under various types of EEG dataset shift. Significance: These results highlight the benefits of ensemble diversity and independent training to build robust and uncertainty-aware EEG classification models. The findings are particularly relevant for clinical applications, where reliability under distribution shift and transparent uncertainty are essential for safe deployment.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

We innovated a peptidomimetic that occupies the canonical focal adhesion kinase (FAK) binding site on the SH3 domain of the neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 9 (NEDD9) protein, a pro-PAH regulator. Peptidomimetic derivatization with a bromoacetamide group alkylated a NEDD9 cysteine positioned uniquely among SH3 domains (Cys18), which stabilized the RT loop, prevented FAK binding, and inhibited human pulmonary artery endothelial cell (HPAEC) migration. When linked to a thalidomide moiety, the peptide showed degrader activity of NEDD9 protein and, therefore, we next investigated therapeutic application of NEDD9 inhibition. In HPAECs, si-NEDD9 downregulated sulfatase-1, which increased podosome rosette formation and cell migration via 6-O-desulfation of glycocalyx-forming heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and reversed vascular remodeling and PAH in vivo. Whereas sulfatase-1 overexpression decreased pulmonary endothelial podosome formation, cell migration, and tube formation and increased collagen III synthesis, sulfatase-1 knockdown prevented fibroproliferative remodeling and pulmonary hypertension in PAH in vivo. These data leverage cysteinyl thiol reactivity to establish an SH3 domain-targeting structure-validated covalent peptide and identify two convergent mechanisms through NEDD9 that control endothelial phenotype, including reverse remodeling via sulfatase-1 transcriptional control.

Although language is often considered a domain-specific function, complex language tasks also engage domain-general networks, such as the Default-Mode (DM) and Multiple-Demand (MD) systems. Yet how these systems contribute to the maturation of verbal competence remains poorly understood. Here, we examined this question using gray matter volume measures in an accelerated longitudinal dataset of children and adolescents from Beijing (N = 170), using the Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI) from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale as a benchmark for verbal abilities. We observed that individual differences in VCI were more strongly associated with structural maturation of domain general networks (DM and MD) than with the language-selective network, and that these effects varied with age. Targeted validation in an independent cohort from Chongqing (N = 150) confirmed significant contributions of domain-general networks in adolescence (13-15 years), highlighting the robustness of these developmental effects. These findings suggest that domain-general cortical systems play a critical and previously underappreciated role in the emergence of verbal intelligence during adolescence, with implications for understanding how large-scale brain networks support the development of abstract verbal reasoning.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Using a novel ultrabright renin cell-specific tdTomato reporter mouse, high-resolution 3D imaging, and single-cell RNA-Seq, we mapped the interactions of renin cells with growing axons during normal kidney vascular development, in response to threats to homeostasis, and a severe arterial disease caused by a defective renin enzyme. During embryonic kidney development, stromal and renin cell progenitors assemble the arterioles, express axon attractants and neurotrophins that establish the precise innervation of renin cells and arterioles in a centrifugal pattern. Hypotension and sodium depletion led to an increase in the volume and number of renin cells along the arterioles. Renin enzymatic deficiency led to hypertrophy and endocrine transformation of renal arterioles, aberrant axon sprouting and sympathetic hyperinnervation suggesting a feed-forward mechanism whereby renin cells and axons co-induce each other, orchestrate neurovascular development and arteriolar remodeling when renin cells are over stimulated.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Using a bioorthogonal cysteine-reactive probe (IA-mTz), we demonstrate that diverse intracellular proteins can be modified, processed, and presented as covalent neoantigens across multiple cell lines. Mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of IA-mTz-modified peptides within the MHC-I immunopeptidome, and structural modeling revealed stable peptide-MHC-I interactions. We further integrated a bioorthogonal strategy that enables immune engagement: IA-mTz-modified cells conjugated with trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-IgG elicited Fc receptor activation in a reporter assay, supporting immune recruitment via antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. This approach was extended to additional cysteine-reactive probes and to 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), a common skin sensitizer, which we show induces covalent neoantigen formation in a cell- and HLA-dependent manner.

Deregulation of the G1/S cell cycle network is common across all subtypes, suggesting subtype-agnostic vulnerabilities. Here, we assessed CDK4/6 dependency using the selective inhibitor palbociclib across 20 patient-derived ex vivo OC models. A subset of models, including four HGSOC and six rarer subtypes, exhibited marked sensitivity to palbociclib, characterised by low CDKN2A/CDKN2B expression, Rb hypophosphorylation, and G1 cell cycle arrest. In contrast, resistant models showed high CDKN2A expression and reduced or absent RB1. Notably, ABCB1 overexpression, a known resistance mechanism in OC, did not mediate palbociclib resistance. Analysis of longitudinal models revealed diminished CDK4/6 dependency following treatment, accompanied by increased CDKN2A expression. These findings support a model of G1/S control in which tumours diverge into CDK4/6- or CDK2-driven proliferation states, with CDKN2A as a potential biomarker to guide patient selection. The predominance of CDK4/6-inhibitor-resistant HGSOC highlights a priority population for CDK2-targeted therapies, offering new treatment strategies for patients with otherwise limited options.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

However, studies of somatosensory realignment with visuomotor adaptation have shown mixed support, possibly due to a confounding coactivation of sensory prediction errors and multisensory integration. While the former is thought to drive adaptation, both processes may contribute to somatosensory realignment. Here, we examined somatosensory realignment following force field adaptation, which is not confounded by multisensory integration. Across two experiments, we tested whether somatosensory realignment mimics three properties of adaptation in this paradigm. Our first experiment examined the specificity of somatosensory realignment to the perceptions of movement or static position and the generalization to reach directions adjacent to the one performed during the adaptation task. The results showed that force field adaptation coincided with a selective realignment of somatosensory perception of movement in the direction of the perturbing force that did not correlate with the magnitude of adaptation or generalize beyond the reach direction of the adaptation task. In a second experiment, we tested whether context-dependent dual adaptation to opposing force field perturbations coincides with a context-dependent dual realignment of somatosensory perception. The results showed no evidence of context-dependent somatosensory realignment after dual adaptation. Our results indicate that somatosensory realignment does not show the same properties as force field adaptation; however, it displays some coherence with the nature of the perturbation. Overall, our data suggest that somatosensory realignment and adaptation likely stem from distinct mechanisms.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Scarb1 is expressed in multiple cell types, including osteoblasts and macrophages. PC-OxPLs, present on OxLDL and apoptotic cells, adversely affect bone metabolism. Overexpression of E06 IgM - a natural antibody that recognizes PC-OxPLs - increases cancellous and cortical bone at 6 months of age in both sexes and protects against age- and high fat diet- induced bone loss, by increasing bone formation. We have reported that SCARB1 is the most abundant scavenger receptor for OxPLs in osteoblastic cells, and osteoblasts derived from Scarb1 knockout mice (Scarb1 KO) are protected from the pro-apoptotic and anti-differentiating effects of OxLDL. Skeletal analysis of Scarb1 KO mice produced contradictory results, with some studies reporting elevated bone mass and others reporting low bone mass. To clarify if Scarb1 mediates the negative effects of PC-OxPLs in bone, we deleted it in osteoblast lineage cells using Osx1-Cre transgenic mice. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements and micro-CT analysis of cancellous and cortical bone at 6 months of age did not reveal any differences between Scarb1{Delta}OSX-l mice and their wild-type (WT), Osx1-Cre, or Scarb1fl/fl littermate controls. We then investigated whether PC-OxPLs could exert their anti-osteogenic effects via activation of SCARB1 in myeloid cells by deleting Scarb1 in LysM-Cre expressing cells. BMD measurements and micro-CT analysis at 6 months of age did not show any differences between Scarb1{Delta}LysM mice and their WT, LysM-Cre, or Scarb1fl/fl controls.

This latter process is facilitated by the unique trilaminate structure of the OHC lateral wall, which consists of the plasma membrane that is densely occupied by the transmembrane motor protein Prestin, the submembrane actin- and spectrin-based cytoskeleton, and the endomembranous subsurface cisternae. This complex system provides mechanical resilience while allowing for cell expansion and contraction during electromotility. Whereas the ultrastructure of the lateral wall is well described, its molecular architecture remains largely elusive. Here, we identified Paralemmin-3 (Palm3) as a novel protein specifically localized to the lateral walls of auditory HCs to play a crucial role in connecting the plasma membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton and subsurface cisternae. Palm3-KO mice display early-onset and progressive hearing impairment that results from diminished cochlear amplification. Subsequent multiscale morphological analyses revealed structural collapse of OHCs that led to progressive and extensive OHC loss along the tonotopic axis. Palm3-KO OHCs exhibited disrupted expression and distribution of several membrane-associated proteins - including spectrin isoforms and Prestin - suggesting an essential role of Palm3 in plasma membrane scaffolding. Electron tomography of OHC lateral walls revealed significantly fewer and structurally perturbed subsurface cisternae. Finally, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated rescue of Palm3 during early postnatal development partly restored hearing function, enhanced OHC survival, and restored OHC cell shape as well as membrane protein expression levels. In summary, Palm3 is a key component of the submembrane cytoskeleton in cochlear hair cells, playing a fundamental role in hair cell biology and hearing, and emerges as an attractive candidate for the long-elusive ''pillar'' component of the hair cell lateral wall ultrastructure.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

However, variability in starting materials and culture protocols between studies has hindered definitive conclusions regarding the nature and consequences of this lipid deficiency.

We compared the use of human AB-serum and Octaplas (solvent/detergent-treated pooled plasma) as lipid sources. Our results reveal that detergent-treated plasma leads to cholesterol-deficient reticulocytes with impaired characteristics, including reduced filtration yield, heightened osmotic fragility, and altered PIEZO1 activity.

Importantly, this study provides the first integrated lipidomic, metabolomic, and proteomic characterisation of in vitro-derived reticulocytes cultured under distinct lipid conditions.

CEP41 encodes a centrosomal protein located at the basal body and the ciliary axoneme and is mutated in ASD individuals and in Joubert syndrome, a ciliopathy with high incidence of ASD. To gain insights into roles of CEP41 in ASD aetiology, we characterised human cortical organoids carrying the CEP41 R242H point mutations found in ASD individuals. This mutation did not interfere with ciliary localisation of CEP41 but cilia were shorter and had lower levels of tubulin polyglutamylation, which is indicative of altered cilia stability and signalling. Moreover, scRNAseq analyses revealed that the expression of several transcription factors with critical roles in interneuron development was altered in mutant interneurons and their progenitors. The CEP41 mutation also caused decreased cortical progenitor proliferation and an augmented formation of upper layer cortical neurons.

Yet it remains to be examined whether relationships among variables vary across observation scales in soil. Generally, it is desirable that observation scale matches the intrinsic scale of a process or pattern. Millimetre-sized soil aggregates are closer to the intrinsic scale of microbial communities than traditionally studied bulk soil samples, making them more suitable for studying potential links between microbial communities and their environment. To explore the effect of observation scale on relationships among soil parameters, we measured bacterial, archaeal, and fungal taxa richness and density, organic matter properties (e.g., carbon and nitrogen content, stoichiometric and isotopic ratios), and soil water content in individual aggregates and aliquots of homogenised soil cores, bulk soil samples, in two soil layers. We analysed pairwise correlations among these variables and assessed whether individual aggregates systematically differed from bulk soil samples. Organic matter properties were more strongly correlated in bulk soil samples, consistent with the idea that increasing the sample volume reduces noise. In contrast, microbial community and organic matter properties showed weaker correlations in bulk soil samples than aggregates in topsoil. In addition, we found that aggregates and bulk soil samples differed systematically in individual microbial and organic matter properties, particularly in the topsoil. Our study demonstrates that relationships among variables in soil are spatial scale-dependent.

Published GWAS to date for TMT-B suffer from relatively low power due to the use of population level data and imputation methods. To address these deficits, we used a family-based study design to identify the genetic variants associated with the TMT-B incorporating both genome-wide linkage analysis (GWLS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). As such, we examined the sequenced genetic determinants of TMT-B using GWLS in over 2000 participants from Long Life Family Study (LLFS). In GWLS, the estimated heritability of TMT-B was 0.29. We detected one significant linkage peak at 15q25 (LOD>3.0). Statistical fine-mapping nominated five variants including three SNPs (NTRK3-rs74031103, protective CEMIP-rs2271159, and protective AGBL1-rs4134376) and two INDELs (protective KLHL25-15:85882445:IND, and protective CEMIP-15:80893381:IND) contributing to the linkage peak.

We investigated how norepinephrine (NE) activation of radial astrocytes alters visual processing in the optic tectum (OT) of developing Xenopus laevis. NE activates calcium transients in radial astrocytes through 1-adrenergic receptors. NE and radial astrocyte activation shifted OT response selectivity to preferentially respond to looming stimuli, associated with predation threat. NE-mediated astrocytic release of ATP/adenosine reduced excitatory transmission by retinal ganglion cell axons, without affecting inhibitory transmission in the OT. Blockade of adenosine receptors prevented both decreased neurotransmission and the selectivity shift. Chemogenetic activation of tectal radial astrocytes reproduced NE's effects and enhanced behavioral detection of looming stimuli in freely swimming animals. NE signaling via radial astrocytes enhances network signal-to-noise for detecting threatening stimuli, with important implications for sensory processing and behavior.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Autosomal dominant mutations in TCF4 result in a profound neurodevelopmental disorder called Pitt-Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS). Germline TCF4 loss-of-function (LOF) studies using human and mouse models have identified dysregulation in neural cell proliferation, genesis, and specification which lead to disruption in neuronal, astroglial and oligodendroglial lineages. In this study, we focused on the role of TCF4 in the genesis of the astrocyte lineage, specifically in the context of modeling PTHS. We show that germline heterozygous mutations in Tcf4 had no effect on the expression of astrocyte marker genes in primary astrocyte cultures and whole brain lysates. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of pan- and subclass-specific astrocyte markers showed Tcf4 mutation had no effect on the proportions of astrocytes in the dorsal cortex and corpus callosum. Lastly, we tracked ventrally-derived astrocytes using an Nkx2.1 reporter mouse and observed that germline Tcf4 LOF did not result in misallocation of ventrally-derived astrocytes into the dorsal cortex, a phenotype previously observed when both Tcf4 alleles were conditionally deleted in the Nkx2.1 lineage. These data indicate that germline heterozygous TCF4 LOF, which models PTHS, does not appear to affect the astrocyte lineage at the cell population level.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Here we provide the first evidence that retinal waves could play an important role by shaping the modular biases in patterns of intracortical connectivity and lay the foundation for orientation selective responses. We demonstrate that slow propagating waves in developing cortex that are dependent on retinal activity recruit specific modular patterns during their movement across the cortical surface, resulting in strikingly elongated patterns of modular coactivity that predict visually-evoked orientation responses at eye opening. Thus axial biases in spontaneous patterns of co-activity are present before the onset of visual experience and could serve as the seed for the developmental emergence of modular orientation representations.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Mice with Fmr1 deletion in microglia exhibited audiogenic seizures (AGS) and decreased PV neuron density in the cortex and AGS-associated inferior colliculus (IC). FMRP increased the expression of lysosomal genes in microglia, including the progranulin-encoding Grn gene. Its loss in microglia led to impaired lysosomal function and increased apoptosis in microglia and PV neurons. Furthermore, PV neuron density in the IC was reduced similarly in male Grn+/-, Fmr1-/y, and Grn+/-;Fmr1-/y mice, and AAV8-mediated overexpression of progranulin rescued AGS and PV neuron loss in Fmr1-/y mice.

C.; Usrey, W.

The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), like all thalamic nuclei, engages in reciprocal synaptic interactions with the cortex, relaying retinal information to and receiving feedback input from primary visual cortex (V1). While retinal excitation is the primary driver of LGN activity, retinal synapses represent a minority of the total synaptic input onto LGN neurons, allowing for both retinogeniculate and geniculocortical signals to be influenced by nonretinal sources. To gain a holistic view of network processing in the geniculocortical pathway, we performed simultaneous extracellular recordings from the LGN and V1 of behaving macaque monkeys, measuring local field potentials (LFPs) and spiking activity. These recordings revealed prominent beta-band oscillations coherent between the LGN and V1 that influenced spike timing in the LGN and were statistically consistent with a feedforward process from the LGN to V1. These thalamocortical oscillations were suppressed by visual stimulation, spatial attention, and behavioral arousal, strongly suggesting that these oscillations are not a feature of active visual processing. Instead, they appear analogous to occipital lobe, alpha oscillations recorded in humans and may represent a signature of signal suppression that occurs during periods of low engagement or active distractor suppression.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Here we show that CRES is produced by hippocampal neurons and astrocytes in the male and female mouse and human brain. Further, approximately 50% of hippocampal astrocytes from aged mice, like the aged human donor samples, had significantly reduced levels of CRES compared to younger mice, suggesting an age-related decline in CRES could contribute to altered brain function. Immunofluorescence experiments showed CRES colocalized with the ECM markers phosphacan and wisteria floribunda agglutinin indicating that CRES is part of the ECM. CRES monomer and high molecular weight SDS-resistant forms were found in insoluble fractions of the hippocampus, cortex, cerebellum, and midbrain and bound to the protein aggregation disease (PAD) ligand, which preferentially binds amyloids but not protein monomers, suggesting a population of CRES exists in the brain as an amyloid structure.

Especially enzymes are often regulated on the post-translational level, resulting in a disconnect between protein levels and activity. Conventional antibody-based methods have limitations, including potential cross reactivity and the inability of antibodies to discriminate between active and inactive enzyme states. Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), an enzyme degrading the neuroprotective endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol, is the target of inhibitors currently in clinical trials for the treatment of several neurological disorders. To support translational and (pre)clinical studies and fully realize the therapeutic opportunities of MAGL inhibitors, it is essential to map the spatial distribution of MAGL activity throughout the brain in both health and disease. Here, we introduce selective fluorescent activity-based probes for MAGL enabling direct visualization of its enzymatic activity in lysates, cultured cells and tissue sections. We show that oxidative stress, which inactivates MAGL through the oxidation of regulatory cysteines, reduces probe labeling , thereby validating the probes activity-dependence. Extending this approach, we developed an activity-based histology protocol to visualize MAGL activity in fresh-frozen mouse and human brain tissues. This approach revealed robust MAGL activity in astrocytes and presynaptic terminals within the mouse hippocampus, and further allows detection of MAGL activity in the human cerebral cortex.

We discover in mice that chronic ethanol exposure induced a dramatic loss of GABAergic, but not glutamatergic, synapses onto dorsolateral striatum fast-spiking interneuron somata and proximal dendrites where perineuronal nets, a subdivision of the extracellular matrix, are enriched. We found that chronic ethanol exposure degraded these perineuronal nets and that enzymatically degrading perineuronal nets similarly reduced GABAergic transmission onto dorsolateral striatum fast-spiking interneurons. Modeling the effect of alcohol, we find that silencing extrinsic GABAergic projections to the dorsolateral striatum increased voluntary ethanol consumption.

DNA-LNPs conjugated to antibodies against PECAM-1 or VCAM-1 target the endothelium of the lungs and brain/spleen, respectively. These LNPs drive robust transgene expression in their target organs, with greater magnitude and duration than untargeted LNPs. Organ specificity of PECAM-targeted expression increases markedly over two weeks, as off-target liver expression declines to undetectable levels. This improvement in organ-specificity of expression is further improved by replacing full-length antibodies with Fab fragments, resulting in a markedly higher lung-to-liver expression ratio than mAb mRNA-LNPs. Single-cell expression analysis reveals the mechanism underlying the improvements in organ-specificity: target organ expression is dominated by long-lived endothelial cells, while off-target liver expression is in non-endothelial cells with shorter half-lives.

Its priming and activation are regulated by numerous proteins including the serine/threonine kinase NEK7. PCNA is a nuclear scaffolding protein essential for DNA replication. In neutrophils, which are differentiated cells deprived of proliferative capacity, PCNA is exclusively cytoplasmic and regulates neutrophil functions through interactions with different protein partners. Among them, pro-Caspases-3/8/9/10 interact with PCNA to regulate apoptosis. We therefore hypothesize that cytoplasmic PCNA could serve as a regulatory platform for the NLRP3 inflammasome via its interaction with its components. In PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages, PCNA relocalized mainly in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, PCNA scaffold inhibitors inhibited IL-1{beta} secretion, pro-Caspase-1 cleavage and pyroptosis-activating gasdermin D cleavage, induced by either nigericin, monosodium urate crystals or Escherichia coli bacteria. Nigericin-stimulation resulted in cytoplasmic PCNA binding to NEK7 and potentially NLRP3, and the p21 peptide, the highest competitive inhibitor of PCNA partner binding, disrupted PCNA-NEK7 interaction. Finally, use of bone marrow-derived macrophages from p21 knockout mice suggested that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 might be a natural repressor of the NLRP3 inflammasome.

In some cases, global epistasis allows evolutionary pathways to be predicted from the fitness of the genetic background alone. In other cases idiosyncratic epistasis makes evolution less predictable. Here, we show that the evolution of antibiotic resistance is highly repeatable, following a common path across most genetic backgrounds. However, rather than being predictable from global epistasis, deviations from this pattern are modulated by function-specific epistasis: perturbations of specific cellular functions lead to novel trajectories of resistance evolution far from the common path. Using tightly controlled robotic evolution experiments, we quantitatively analyzed resistance trajectories for three clinically relevant antibiotics across multiple genetic backgrounds, including hundreds of Escherichia coli gene-deletion strains and several clinical isolates from urinary-tract infections. We show that disrupting distinct sets of cellular functions creates contingencies that alter evolutionary trajectories for specific drugs and across different drugs, and we identify genetic changes defining these alternative trajectories. Importantly, this function-specific epistasis often slows down resistance evolution. Some of these effects can also be induced by small-molecule inhibitors of the identified targets, suggesting that function-specific epistasis can be exploited to improve drug treatments.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

T.; Villesen, P.; Bilde, T.; Schierup, M. H.", "abstract": "Germline mutations play a crucial role in determining the rate of molecular evolution. In the spider genus Stegodyphus, sociality has independently evolved three times within the past million years, each transition accompanied by major life history shifts, including obligate inbreeding, highly female biased sex ratios, reduced fecundity, and drastically lowered effective population sizes. We conducted whole genome sequencing of 202 parent-offspring trios from 34 families across three social and four subsocial species to estimate mutation rates in a phylogenetic comparative framework. Strikingly, each independent transition to sociality is associated with an approximately 50% reduction in germline mutation rate. This reduction has persisted over evolutionary timescales and suggests that mutation rates can decline rapidly, even in lineages with small effective population sizes, departing from predictions of the drift barrier hypothesis, which posits that mutation rates should increase under stronger genetic drift. We propose that the observed decline arises from life history mediated changes in germline dynamics such as slower development and fewer germline cell divisions, rather than direct selection on DNA repair efficiency. Our results highlight how social evolution can reshape fundamental genomic parameters and caution against assuming static mutation rates in evolutionary inference, underscoring the importance of ecological and developmental context in interpreting mutation rate variation.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

However, existing human-based models fail to reproduce the early and complex microglia-neural cell interactions. The differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into specialized cell types offers promising avenues for understanding human development and disease modeling. Herein, we explore the differentiation of hiPSC-derived erythromyeloid progenitors (iEMPs) and their 3D co-culture with hiPSC-derived neurospheres, utilizing the Ambr 250 Modular system. The aim of this research was to build a complex co-culture model between iEMP and neurospheres in a scalable and controlled environment. Our results demonstrate that the Ambr 250 Modular system effectively supports the co-culture process, with iEMPs integration into the neurospheres, exhibiting cell density, aggregate morphology and concentration similar to the neurosphere monocultures. The co-culture environment induced the upregulation of transcription factors critical for microglial lineage commitment. iEMP-neurospheres displayed a unique secretory profile, releasing proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and neuronal differentiation, essential for microenvironment remodeling. In conclusion, this study underscores the role of iEMPs in CNS development and presents a robust platform for preclinical research.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

To address whether memory responses induced by one strain can protect against a genetically distinct strain, we conducted a heterologous reinfection study in cynomolgus macaques involving primary infection by a Lineage 4 Erdman Mtb strain and subsequent re-challenge by a Lineage 2 strain (HT-L2). HT-L2 belongs to a clade that epidemiology showed to be spreading successfully over the last decade in Lima, Peru.

To solve this problem, we present here a phylogenetic classification following the PhyloCode for the Solanaceae. Traditional taxon names previously recognized at the ranks of tribe, genus, and section were maintained when associated with clades. We base our clade definitions on a newly constructed phylogeny of the family using 10 plastid and nuclear markers with a broad sampling of 1,474 species, roughly half of the diversity of the family. We complement this marker-based analysis with a phylogenomic analysis of 110 taxa (including 97 of the 102 genera in the family) using the Angiosperms353 probe set. This pair of analyses produced highly concordant phylogenies and provides strong support for the clades included in the classification.

Common techniques for microbial mutation rate estimation fall into 2 camps; rapid, locus specific, generally liquid-culture based fluctuation assays; and slow, genome-wide, generally solid-culture based mutation accumulation experiments. This constrains the hypotheses which can be tested, notably the mutagenic effects of liquid environments cannot be rapidly quantified at a genome-wide scale. One example of such effect is the negative association previously observed between population density and mutation rates at many marker loci using the fluctuation assay. Because homogeneous population density is specifically relevant in liquid culture, this association has not been tested at a truly genome-wide scale. We fill this methodological gap by developing a novel pipeline that relies on population sequencing to capture how mutation rates are affected by population density in liquid cultures. We simulate expected mutation counts in a growing population along with random sampling during sequencing to estimate the necessary sequencing coverage as [&ge;]1,000-fold. We then carry out PCR-free sequencing of 95 wildtype E. coli populations at this coverage, calling rare variants with both reference-based and reference-free methods. These variant-calling methods are prone to different sources of error which can be minimised by considering only mutations called by both pipelines. This approach identifies 119 mutations across all cultures, with (non)coding/(non)synonymous and mutational spectrum profiles consistent with being samples of spontaneous mutation unbiased by selection. The distribution of these mutations also supports the motivating hypothesis, finding that mutation counts across the genome are strongly negatively associated with population density.

We measure the effect of structural complexity, staple design, and scaffold design on each energetic parameter, folding yield, and kinetics. We show that the scaffold crossover pattern determines the extent of cooperativity and subsequent folding kinetics, where fewer scaffold crossovers result in more cooperative folding.

The highly-glycosylated SB is intrinsically disordered and rigidifies the cell wall to facilitate ordered depositions of cellulose microfibril, which when affected compromised the cell wall integrity and rendered a soften cell wall. We further pinpointed critical glycosylation sites on the SB that contributes to its disordered propensity and osmosensing function.

We propose that the highly disordered AGP may act as a cell wall scaffold protein to mediate wall materials biosynthesis/deposition and play a role in apical tip growth as well as extracellular osmosensing.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

MI events significantly impact intestinal integrity which results in leakage of bacterial products into the systemic circulation. We demonstrate that MI not only compromises intestinal integrity, leading to systemic leakage of bacterial products like LPS, but also results in the translocation and colonization of live, intact gut bacteria in the MI heart, a novel aspect of the heart-gut axis. Our initial findings with natural murine gut microbiome were substantiated using orally administered E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), as a tracer bacterium. Furthermore, we engineered EcN to express the microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM) derived from the probiotic Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Treatment with this engineered strain, EcN-MAM, led to significantly improved survival and cardiac function in MI mice. This was attributed to enhanced gut barrier integrity, resulting in reduced systemic bacterial permeation and subsequent inflammation. These findings shed light on a previously unrecognized dimension of the heart-gut axis and highlight the potential of microbiome-based interventions in MI management.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

B.; Fiorenza, M. T.; Canterini, S.; Ramawat, S.; Bardella, G.; Pani, P.; Ferraina, S.; Brunamonti, E.", "abstract": "Understanding the ordinal relationships between items requires constructing a rank order supporting decision-making between options. This process depends on the ability to learn reciprocal relationships and to select the best option available when making a choice. In such forms of decision-making, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in encoding the relative value of alternatives as a decision is formed. Higher-order cognitive abilities are influenced by genetic factors that affect dopamine availability in the PFC, potentially contributing to individual differences. Here, we examined the performance of 83 participants in a transitive inference task (TI), grouped by genotype based on the Val158Met single-nucleotide polymorphism in the Catechol-O-Methyltransferase (COMT) gene. The task included a learning phase in which participants acquired the reciprocal relationships among a set of hierarchically ranked items (A>B>C>D>E>F), followed by a test phase in which they were required to compare all possible item pairs and select the higher-ranked one. While genotype did not significantly influence test-phase performance, it did affect learning efficiency. Specifically, Val homozygotes took a longer learning procedure than both heterozygotes and Met homozygotes during the learning phase. Drift diffusion modelling (DDM) revealed that task performance was explained by the efficiency of evidence accumulation, which was lower in Val homozygotes, accounting for their poorer performance not only during initial learning but also when required to switch to a reversed hierarchical structure (A<B<C<D<E<F). These findings suggest that individual differences in inferential decision-making and cognitive flexibility may be partially driven by genetically determined variations in prefrontal dopamine availability.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we study several iPSC-derived dopamine neuron (iPSC-DAN) lines, from individuals with idiopathic PD, which is the most common form of PD. Specifically, using iPSC-DAN differentiated for 50-55 days, we performed an in-depth analysis of different bioenergetic pathways and cellular quality control mechanisms in the cells. Our results showed wide ranging impairments in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), glycolysis and creatine kinase pathways in the PD dopamine (DA) neurons. Specifically, the PD neurons exhibited reduced oxygen consumption rates (OCR) at baseline and after challenges with mitochondrial inhibitors, as well as decreased glycolytic reserves measured via ECAR. This translated to lower OCR:ECAR ratios signifying more reliance on glycolysis vs OXPHOS in the PD cells. Moreover, a mislocalization of creatine kinase B to mitochondria was seen in the PD cells. These energetic changes synergized with the enhanced expression of mitochondrial fission proteins, disrupted mitophagy and oxidative stress. Additionally, the PD neurons contained more monomeric, phosphorylated and aggregated forms of alpha synuclein and displayed reduced viability. Ultrastructural examination through immuno-electron microscopy showed more alpha synuclein gold particles directly associated with mitochondria and packing autophagic vesicles. In essence, these data capture a web of key changes in human iPSC-DAN from idiopathic PD subjects associated with neuronal degeneration.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

In typically post-mitotic neurons, abnormal reactivation of cell cycle regulators and DNA replication licensing factors is observed in ALS pathogenesis. Emerging evidence links components of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) complex, notably MCM2, to replication stress and genomic instability, implying a mechanistic role in ALS pathogenesis. Objective: To determine whether ALS-associated mutations in FUS and SOD1 influence MCM2 expression and localisation in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived spinal motor neurons (MNs). Methods: We differentiated isogenic hiPSC lines carrying FUS P525L-GFP and R495QfsX527, a SOD1 mutant line, and matched wild-type controls into spinal MNs ([&ge;]28 days in vitro). QRT-PCR quantified MCM2 mRNA levels ({Delta}{Delta}Ct method; n=3 biological replicates, technical triplicates). Protein expression was assessed by Western blot densitometry (n=3). Subcellular distribution of MCM2 in FUS mutants was evaluated by immunofluorescence (pilot, N=1; [&ge;]50 cells quantified). Results: FUS P525L MNs exhibited a modest, non-significant increase in MCM2 mRNA (1.3-fold vs. WT; p=0.1319) but a significant 1.8-fold elevation in MCM2 protein levels (p=0.034). The R495QfsX527 line showed a comparable trend at the transcript level (1.2-fold; p > 0.05) and a 1.6-fold increase in protein (p = 0.041). SOD1 mutant MNs demonstrated a pronounced 2.3-fold MCM2 protein upregulation (p=0.008). Immunofluorescence in FUS mutant MNs revealed no significant nuclear-to-cytoplasmic shift in MCM2 localisation, indicating that elevated MCM2 levels are not driven by subcellular mislocalization. Conclusion: ALS-linked FUS and SOD1 mutations upregulate MCM2 protein in human spinal MNs, suggesting post-transcriptional or stability-driven regulation. The absence of relocalisation in FUS mutants shows that this impact is caused by overexpression rather than mislocalisation. MCM2 may be a biomarker of disease-associated replication stress. Future studies will explore whether MCM2 overexpression exacerbates DNA damage or serves as a compensatory response, clarifying its role in ALS pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

On a C57BL/6J background homozygous kinase-dead Csf1r mutation (Csf1rE631K/E631K - E631Km/m) causes perinatal lethality. Here we demonstrate that E631Km/m mice on a mixed genetic background (C57 x BALB/c F2) are osteopetrotic and growth retarded but viable as adults with no other gross developmental deficits. They lack osteoclasts, microglia and most peripheral tissue resident macrophages and exhibit perturbed hematopoiesis. Although CD169+ tissue resident macrophages in bone marrow are considered an essential component of the hematopoietic niche, CD169 is undetectable in E631Km/m marrow and F4/80+ macrophages are depleted. These changes are associated with expansion of mature and immature granulocytes and reduced B cells, whereas monocytes and stem and progenitor populations are unaffected as a proportion of total cells. Erythropoiesis in bone marrow is maintained in E631Km/m mice, associated with a residual population of CSF1R-independent CD169-ve/F4/80+ macrophages. Nevertheless, splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis in E631Km/m mice indicates a degree of bone marrow insufficiency. Red pulp macrophages are retained but CD169+ marginal metallophil macrophages are absent and CD209b+ (SIGNR1) macrophages are present but disorganized. Circulating white blood cell count is unchanged in E631Km/m mice, but the proportion of neutrophils is greatly increased whilst B cells and monocytes are reduced. This novel model reveals the essential roles of CSF1R-dependent macrophages in hematopoiesis and demonstrates that many developmental and homeostatic functions attributed to murine resident tissue macrophages are redundant and/or specific to inbred mouse strains.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

It is essential for viability in Staphylococcus aureus and regulates genes that encode the autolysins and other critical proteins. The sensor kinase WalK phosphorylates WalR at aspartic acid residue 53 (D53) in the receiver domain, stimulating promoter DNA binding. Unlike other response regulators, WalR is thought to have a second kinase, the serine/threonine kinase PknB, which phosphorylates the receiver domain at threonine residue 101. We previously reported that a walR mutation that changed T101 to a methionine conferred low level resistance to vancomycin and greatly increased susceptibility to tunicamycin along with several other phenotypic traits. In this work we demonstrate similarities between pknB null and the WalRT101M mutants that support a regulatory role for PknB-mediated phosphorylation of WalR. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches, we confirm the specificity of this posttranslational modification and confirm that phosphorylation at both D53 and T101 is important for dimer formation. Importantly, using an in silico approach, we have discovered that phosphorylation at T101 creates an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the phosphate group and E108, that strengthens contacts along the WalR dimerization interface. This is the first time that a clear molecular role has been assigned to this posttranslational modification and it is the strongest molecular evidence to date for a direct functional relationship between PknB and WalR. We propose that, together with primary activation by WalK, PknB serves as a second potentiating input into the WalKR system, stimulating WalR dimer formation, and target DNA binding and tethering this transcriptional event to important extracellular stimuli.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

TargetRNA3 and IntaRNA functional annotation predicted regulatory effects on TCA cycle flux, redox balance, and the transport of sugars and amino acids.

This conjecture was supported by metabolomics, which verified the buildup of short-chain acids and purine intermediates. A change in regulation was also noted, with ProQ and CsrA levels rising in tandem with Hfq's downregulation.

Based on these traits we developed a structure-guided computational pipeline that can sift through large phage genome databases to unbiasedly predict phage proteins that manipulate bacterial immune signaling. Numerous previously uncharacterized proteins, grouped into three families, were verified to inhibit the bacterial Thoeris and CBASS signaling systems. Proteins of the Sequestin and Lockin families bind and sequester the TIR-produced signaling molecules 3'cADPR and His-ADPR, while proteins of the Acb5 family cleave and inactivate 3'3'-cGAMP and related molecules. X-ray crystallography and structural modeling, combined with mutational analyses, explain the structural basis for sequestration or cleavage of the immune signals. Thousands of these signal-manipulating proteins were detected in phage protein databases, with some instances present in well-studied model phages such as T2, T4 and T6.

The effects of distinct cereal sources on the composition and functionality of gut microbiota are, however, poorly investigated so far. In vitro studies offer a valuable approach to gain detailed insights on this matter, however, require a substrate that closely mimics the conditions found in the large intestine. In this study, we performed predigestion of cereal substrates using ileo-cecally fistulated minipigs simulating the upper gastrointestinal digestion. The composition of microbiota, total cell counts, and short chain fatty acid concentrations after a 24 h incubation were analysed. Results were compared to cultures containing native substrates. Results: Both acetate and propionate concentration were significantly higher in predigested rye compared to predigested wheat (8.17 : 2.71 vs. 6.55 : 2.16 mmol/l and 3.40 : 0.436 vs. 2.64 : 0.337 mmol/l, respectively), whereas butyrate concentrations were not different. Substantial differences were observed between native and predigested substrates with a higher butyrate production on the former. Bacterial cell counts were higher in predigested substrates and elevated in rye cultures compared to respective wheat incubations. Bacterial communities differed markedly between the two predigested cereals as well as between native and predigested substrates. Several known butyrate and propionate producers, for example Agathobacter, Blautia, Coprococcus, Mediterraneibacter and Roseburia, grew significantly more on predigested rye than on predigested wheat. Bifidobacterium, Clostridium sensu stricto, and Succinivibrio were significantly more abundant on native substrates compared to their predigested forms.

While microbial degradation may offer a viable solution, the mechanisms underlying keratin breakdown remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employed a high-resolution proteogenomic approach to characterize the keratinolytic machinery of Onygena corvina, a non-pathogenic saprophytic fungus. Using a membrane agar plate method with insoluble substrates, we obtained secretomes enriched in secreted and substrate-bound proteins during growth on - and {beta}-keratin-rich substrates, specifically wool and feather meal. Our findings reveal that O. corvina has a richer proteolytic machinery than previously reported, including enzymes that are used across keratin types, as well as enzymes that are specifically targeted to either - or {beta}-keratin. In addition to proteases, the secretomes contain numerous other proteins, including cell wall-modifying enzymes, oxidoreductases, esterases, phosphatases, and sialidases that are involved in the deconstruction of keratin. We propose that these additional enzymes destabilize keratin through a combination of mechanical keratinolysis, removal of post-translational modifications, reduction of disulfide bonds, and cleavage of isopeptide bonds, thereby enhancing proteolytic accessibility. Interestingly, keratin degradation by O. corvina was most efficient when using mixed substrates containing both feather and wool meal.

However, PARP1's role in the recognition, processing, and intracellular signaling downstream of DNA damage in cells remains incompletely understood, especially in a replication-independent context. Here, we show that cells exposed to high doses of the methylating agent Methyl Methanesulfonate (MMS) generate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in a base excision repair (BER)-dependent and DNA replication-independent manner. The capacity of cells to generate DSBs after MMS exposure relies heavily on intracellular NAD+ availability and PARP1 catalytic production of PAR. In our experimental system, we show that acute MMS exposure causes NAD+ exhaustion in a PARP1-dependent manner, which results in a temporal-dependent loss of downstream PARP1 activity. This functional loss of PARP1 signaling in later timepoints leads to the loss of BER-dependent single-strand break (SSB)-to-DSB conversion, as well as silencing of ATR-Chk1 signaling in both cycling and non-cycling cells, demonstrating a novel PARP1-dependent regulatory mechanism for both ATR-Chk1 signaling and BER-associated processes following methylation challenge. Additionally, we provide experimental evidence supporting the role of PARP1 and NAD+ in promoting the exonuclease-mediated SSB-to-DSB conversion.

However, the structural basis of interactions between EA and TRPC4/5 proteins has remained elusive, limiting our ability to fully understand and exploit mechanisms of TRPC4/5 channel activation by this intriguing natural product. Here, we present nine high-resolution cryo-EM structures (2.4-3.2 [A]) of human TRPC5 - representing different states and ligand occupancies - which show that EA binds to a conserved lipid binding site between transmembrane domains of adjacent TRPC5 subunits. Our structural models are consistent with the effects of mutagenesis of nearby residues on EA's potency, efficacy and activation kinetics, and allow us to rationalise competitive inhibition by other TRPC4/5 modulators as well as EA's selectivity profile within the TRPC family.

These SDs are organized around a high-copy, ancestral core duplicon known as LCR16a (Low Copy Repeat 16a), and are characterized by an enrichment of Alu elements at their boundaries. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying SD formation across four clusters within the 16p12.3-p13.11 region. Analysis of 94 genome assemblies showed 12 and 8 alternative structures in clusters 1-2 and 3-4, respectively. These include at least 10 duplication/deletion events and 5 inversions. Breakpoint mapping revealed that 13 out of 15 events arose via nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR). In particular, 6 had breakpoints in duplicons associated with LCR16a, 2 occurred within the LCR16a sequence itself, and 5 were mediated by Alu elements--one of which located within LCR16a. The last mechanism contributes to multiallelic, tandem copy-number variation involving two distinct LCR16a-duplicon pairs. We identified an interspersed, inverted duplicative transposition, possibly driven by double template switches at homologous sites--specifically, Alu elements located within inverted copies of LCR16a and an associated duplicon. Comparative analyses using nonhuman primate T2T genome assemblies suggest that clusters 3 and 4 originated ~6 million years ago in the human-chimpanzee common ancestor through double template switching involving Alu repeats. Clusters 1 and 2 primarily formed more recently through human-specific LCR16a-associated duplicative transpositions.

Gene Ontology analysis revealed significant enrichment in genome maintenance pathways, including ''chromatin remodeling'' and ''DNA repair.''

Here, we demonstrate programmable RNA editing with evolved TadA-derived deaminases and 2'-methoxyethyl (MOE)-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) to guide site-directed A-to-I editing. In contrast to ADAR enzymes, TadA proteins modify single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). We profile ASO-guided TadA-based editors on endogenous and disease-relevant mRNAs and develop a \"bulge-forming\" ASO architecture to constrain RNA editing to the target site. Further, we demonstrate that a covalent adenosine deaminase-ASO \"RNP\" conjugate formed in the test tube and delivered by lipofection achieves targeted and efficient RNA editing with dramatically lower transcriptome-wide off-target editing as compared to ectopically expressed RNA editing enzymes. Taken together, our work expands the scope of programmable RNA editing methods with broad implications for therapeutic modulation of RNA behavior.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that the same chemistry activates oligoribonucleotides and drives both nonenzymatic and ribozyme-catalyzed RNA ligation within the same reaction environment.

Although these predictions can be experimentally tested, current scFMs are unable to close the loop and learn from these experiments to create better predictions. Here, we introduce a closed-loop framework that extends the scFM by incorporating perturbation data during model fine-tuning. Our closed-loop model improves prediction accuracy, increasing positive predictive value in the setting of T-cell activation three-fold. We applied this model to RUNX1-familial platelet disorder, a rare pediatric blood disorder and identified two therapeutic targets (mTOR and CD74-MIF signaling axis) and two novel pathways (protein kinase C and phosphoinositide 3-kinase).

Understanding the interactions of small molecules with cytoskeletal protein therefore might help in the development of therapeutics. Employing combined molecular docking, all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) and infrequent well-tempered metadynamics (iWT-MetaD) we studied bacterial inhibitor A22 and actin protein interaction. Five probable A22 binding sites (S1-S5) were observed in actin and unbiased MD simulations of 100 ns - 500 ns showed structural stability at these sites. Interaction analyses showed A22 to mostly forms transient interactions except at sites S4 and S5 where long-lives interactions were present. Enhanced sampling simulations quantitatively estimated ligand dissociation free energy ~ - 2 kcal/mol to -3.5 kcal/mol for sites S1-S4 with residence times ~ microseconds to milliseconds. For site S5, we observed the highest binding affinity (~ - 6.05 kcal/mol) and longest residence time ~ 0.75 sec. Analyses of the dissociation trajectories predict multiple dissociation pathways for A22 and found key gatekeeper residues at specific-sites facilitating ligand dissociation. Comparison of A22 with other known inhibitors suggest that A22 binds actin with relatively lower affinity, however, exhibits site-specific unbinding kinetics. Thus, our study provides a detailed mechanistic overview of A22-actin interaction, its various binding modes, and unbinding kinetics. It also shows the importance and usage of infrequent metadynamics in exploring rare events like ligand-protein interaction. Deeper insights gained from this study expands our understanding of cytoskeletal ligand dynamics. These knowledges will be paramount in designing drug targeting cytoskeletal protein actin.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "E. coli RecBCD, a hetero-trimeric helicase and nuclease, functions in double stranded (ds) DNA break repair and in degrading foreign DNA. RecBCD possesses ATPase motor domains within both RecB and RecD and a nuclease domain within RecB (RecBNuc). RecBCD binds to double stranded DNA ends and initiates DNA unwinding by first melting several DNA base pairs (bp) using only its binding free energy. The RecBNuc domain is docked ~70 angstroms from the duplex DNA binding site in RecBCD-DNA structures but appears to be dynamic and able to move from its docked position. Here, we compare DNA binding of RecBCD and a variant, RecB{Delta}NucCD, in which the 30 kDa nuclease domain has been deleted. RecBCD binding to a blunt DNA end is enthalpically unfavorable and entropically driven. Deletion of RecBNuc results in an increase in DNA binding affinity, suggesting an allosteric effect of RecBNuc. RecB{Delta}NucCD binding to DNA possessing fully pre-melted DNA ends is associated with a large favorable {Delta}Hobs, but much smaller than observed for RecBCD, suggesting that deletion of RecBNuc limits bp melting from a blunt DNA. We also solved cryo-EM structures showing only 4 bp melted upon RecB{Delta}NucCD binding to a blunt ended DNA duplex, less than the 11 bp melted upon RecBCD binding. Thus, the RecB nuclease domain regulates the extent of bp melting by RecBCD. These results also suggest that RecBNuc may manifest its long-range allosteric effect on DNA binding and DNA melting via linker-linker interactions between RecB and RecC.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Protein crystals can serve as scaffolds to immobilize small molecules, enabling structural and dynamic analysis of saccharides that are difficult to study by conventional approaches. However, constructing versatile scaffold crystals for high-throughput structural analysis remains challenging because this work involves laborious protein production and crystallization workflows. Here, we report rapid crystallization and structural analysis of saccharide-bound scaffolds by applying cell-free protein crystallization (CFPC) to galectin-10 (Gal-10), a lectin known to crystallize spontaneously in vivo. Using CFPC-generated Gal-10 crystals, we obtained the first atomic-resolution structures of melezitose, one of the trisaccharide, bound to the protein scaffold, revealing binding modes inaccessible by conventional approaches. Normalized B-factor analysis combined with molecular dynamics simulations reveals how the binding-site architecture modulates saccharide flexibility and immobilization.

Traditionally, the accumulation of genetic mutations over time has been considered a primary driver of age-related tumorigenesis. However, emerging evidence highlights the critical role of the aging tissue microenvironment -- including changes in immune, stromal, and epithelial compartments -- in shaping cancer initiation and progression. In this study, we employed integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to systematically characterize age-associated alterations in human skin and skin cancers. Our analysis uncovered widespread, cell type-specific transcriptional reprogramming with age, revealing key pathways and cellular populations that may contribute to a pro-tumorigenic environment. Notably, we identified a previously unrecognized fibroblast subtype marked by SFRP2 expression, which expands with age and is associated with poor prognosis in basal cell carcinoma. These fibroblasts appear to enhance Wnt signaling within the tumor niche, suggesting a potential mechanism by which the aging stroma supports malignancy. Collectively, our findings shed light on how age-related changes in tissue ecosystems may predispose to cancer and point to novel therapeutic opportunities for targeting the aged tumor microenvironment.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

To explore the roles of the arabidopsis TPPs, we analyzed their expression in shoot apices and found distinct spatial patterns, including TPPI and TPPJ expressed in shoot meristem boundaries, reminiscent of RA3 expression. Single and double TPP mutants lacked dramatic phenotypes, however a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of all ten TPP genes resulted in increased branching, mirroring ra3 mutants in maize, as well as reduced size and earlier flowering. Expression of GFP-tagged TPPI under its native promoter partially complemented these defects, with protein localization in meristems, vascular tissues and in nuclei. Metabolite profiling revealed higher trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P), lower trehalose, and altered sugar and iron-associated metabolites. The mutants also developed chlorosis and grew poorly on low-nutrient media, linked to low iron levels, and reversible with iron supplementation. Consistent with these findings, developmental and iron-responsive genes were up-regulated in the mutants, while photosynthesis-related genes were repressed. Our findings suggest that TPP genes redundantly regulate shoot architecture, sugar metabolism, iron homeostasis and photosynthesis in arabidopsis, and support a role for TPP-mediated Tre6P signaling in coordinating developmental and physiological pathways.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

M.; Rossi, G.; Salazar Gutierrez, M.; Tian, D.; Leisner, C.", "abstract": "Climate change poses a significant threat to perennial fruit crops, including blueberries, by altering temperature dependent developmental processes such as dormancy and bud break. This study investigates the projected impacts of mid 21st century warming on chilling accumulation and phenological development in rabbiteye blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum) cultivars Krewer and Titan. Using downscaled climate projections from 20 global climate models under the RCP 8.5 scenario, we estimated future temperature trends for a key southeastern U.S. blueberry production region. We quantified changes in chilling hours, chilling portions, and freeze event probabilities between historical (1981 to 2000) and projected (2041 to 2070) periods. Results indicate a substantial reduction in chilling accumulation, chilling hours decreased by 66.6% and chilling portions by nearly half, alongside a delayed onset and shortened duration of chilling periods. Despite warming, freezing events are still expected during critical phenological windows, potentially increasing frost damage risk. Growth chamber experiments simulating ambient and elevated temperature regimes revealed significant cultivar-specific shifts in the timing and rate of bud break and bloom stages. Logistic models developed from these data provide predictive tools for assessing phenological responses under future climates. These findings highlight the vulnerability of rabbiteye blueberry to climate-induced dormancy disruption and underscore the need for adaptive management strategies and cultivar selection to sustain productivity in a warming climate.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}

Despite two decades of research, however, we have reached little consensus. In the current study, we analysed pooled fMRI data from four different studies that used the same sentence reading task and methodological approach. The combined sample included 56 adolescents and adults who stutter and 53 demographically matched typically fluent controls. A sparse-sampling design was used in each study, in which participants spoke during the silent period between measurements of brain activity. Sentence reading evoked activity in both groups across frontal and temporal regions bilaterally. At statistical thresholds corrected for family-wise error, there were no significant group differences. An uncorrected threshold was applied to explore group differences in areas previously identified in earlier fMRI studies on stuttering. People who stutter (PWS) showed greater activity compared with controls in right frontal pole, right anterior insula extending to frontal operculum, left planum temporale, and midbrain, at the level of red nucleus. In contrast, PWS showed lower activity in left superior frontal sulcus, subgenual medial prefrontal cortex, right anterior temporal lobe, and portions of inferior parietal lobe bilaterally including the angular gyrus on the left. Despite pooling data across multiple studies to achieve a relatively large sample, group differences in regions involved in speech-motor control only emerged at an uncorrected voxel-wise threshold. Some of these findings align with previous fMRI studies, such as increased activity in the right anterior insular cortex.", "date": "2025-07-12", "journal": ""}
