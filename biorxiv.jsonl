Refining our understanding of LC function largely relies on selective transgene expression in LC-NE neurons, allowing targeted manipulation and readout of noradrenergic neurons. Here, we performed a side-by-side comparison of the most commonly used strategies to genetically target the LC, including different cre driver lines and promoter-mediated transgene expression. We report differences between these strategies in terms of transgene expression efficacy and specificity. Parallelly, we found no behavioral alterations in cre-expressing mice of any mouse line compared to wild-type littermates. Finally, to further facilitate the investigation of LC-NE function, we created a suite of constructs, including a reporter protein, a calcium indicator, and a light-driven cation channel, whose expression is mediated by the previously described PRSx8 promoter. These constructs allow identification, monitoring, and manipulation of LC-NE activity either in wild-type mice, or in combination with tissue-specific manipulations of different cre driver lines. The results of our study are crucial for the interpretation of previous experiments using the respective targeting strategies, as well as for the design of future studies.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

In the rodent olfactory bulb, which is renowned for substantial structural plasticity driven by adult neurogenesis and persistent turnover of dendritic spines, we show that by synergistically combining both types of plasticity this flexibility-stability dilemma can be overcome. To do so, we develop a computational model for structural plasticity in the olfactory bulb and show that it is the maturation process of adult-born neurons that enables the bulb to learn quickly and forget slowly. Particularly important are the transient enhancement of the plasticity, excitability, and susceptibility to apoptosis that characterizes young neurons. The model captures many experimental observations and makes a number of testable predictions. Overall, it identifies memory consolidation as an important role of adult neurogenesis in olfaction and exemplifies how the brain can maintain stable memories despite ongoing extensive neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Thus, language interaction is highly demanding on fast adjustment of speech production. Here, we developed a real-time coupled-oscillators virtual partner that allows - by changing the coupling strength parameters - to modulate the ability to synchronise speech with a virtual speaker. Then, we recorded the intracranial brain activity of 16 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy while they performed a verbal coordination task with the virtual partner (VP). More precisely, patients had to repeat short sentences synchronously with the VP. This synchronous speech task is efficient to highlight both the dorsal and ventral language pathways. Importantly, combining time-resolved verbal coordination and neural activity shows more spatially differentiated patterns and different types of neural sensitivity along the dorsal pathway. More precisely, high-frequency activity in left secondary auditory regions is highly sensitive to verbal coordinative dynamics, while primary regions are not. Finally, while bilateral engagement was observed in the high-frequency activity of the IFG BA44 - which seems to index online coordinative adjustments that are continuously required to compensate deviation from synchronisation - interpretation of right hemisphere involvement should be approached cautiously due to relatively sparse electrode coverage.

Here we develop a multiscale whole-cell theory to investigate cell spreading and migration in two-dimensional (2D) viscoelastic channel confinements of varying width and curvature. Our simulations show that, in straight channels, the cell migration speed depends monotonically on the substrate elastic stiffness, which is otherwise biphasic on an unconfined substrate. This is because confinement enforces directional spreading while reducing the spreading area, which results in lower intracellular viscous drag on the nucleus and a higher net traction force of polarized cells in our model. In contrast, we find that confinement curvature slows down cell migration since the friction forces between the bending cell and the confinement walls increase with curvature. We validate our model with experimental data for cell migration in straight channels spanning a wide range of (ECM) stiffness as well as in curved channels. Our model illuminates the intertwined effects of substrate viscoelasticity and confinement geometry on cell spreading and migration in complex microenvironments, revealing that geometric curvature can hierarchically override substrate mechanics to dominate migration regulation.

A.", "abstract": "The fidelity of template-dependent mRNA synthesis during transcription elongation is the primary determinant of accurate gene expression and the maintenance of functional RNA transcripts. However, the mechanisms governing transcription fidelity remain incompletely understood. While previous studies have characterized how error rates vary with nucleotide identity at upstream and downstream positions from the incorporation site, the comprehensive microscopic explanation of this sequence dependence has not been elucidated. In this study, we develop a novel theoretical approach that integrates transcription proofreading mechanisms and inhomogenous DNA sequence effects. Using first-passage analysis validated by Monte Carlo simulations, we quantitatively characterize nucleotide-specific error rates during RNA polymerase II transcription. The model accurately reproduces experimental error rates and predicts kinetic parameters influencing transcriptional fidelity. Analysis reveals nucleotide incorporation rates follow the hierarchy U<C<G<A, consistent with independent experimental observations. Notably, our model not only explains how the error rates depend on the nature of the base immediately downstream (+1) but also predicts that the identity of the nucleotide at the second downstream position (+2) also plays an important role. Pyrimidines at position +2 contribute to lower error rates than purines, whereas the third downstream base (+3) has no effect. These previously unreported correlations are corroborated by bioinformatic analysis of existing datasets. In addition, using the BRCA1 gene as an example, we explore the physiological implications of sequence-dependent error rates, identifying an increased likelihood of premature stop codon errors.

Observers were instructed to respond to rare targets of a deviant shape and ignore rare non-targets of a deviant color. Source analysis was based on noise-normalized minimum norm estimates in an individual, MRI-based cortical source space. Critically, the source space was extended with the hippocampus. Source analysis showed strong sources in retrosplenial cortex and hippocampus at the P3 peak. Subsequent activity was observed in insula and anterior mid-cingulate cortex. The source configuration was similar for rare target and non-target stimuli. Simulations and further analyses show that the source in retrosplenial cortex is strongly attenuated in magnetoencephalography, whereas the source in hippocampus contributes to both recording modalities. These data support that retrosplenial cortex is a main generator of the P3 in EEG and that the hippocampal P3 source can be recorded with extracranial EEG and MEG.

However, the precise tuning of these neuron models remains a major aspect of modeling work to accurately reproduce neuronal properties and understand their implications in network activity. To this end, the precise characterization of neuronal electrophysiological properties, from linear properties to the input-output (I/O) relationship and spike frequency adaptation, from intracellular recordings is a crucial step. Furthermore, the increasing availability of publicly accessible databases opens the possibility of deriving I/O properties for point-neuron models from multiple datasets studying different neuronal populations. However, despite recent advancements in establishing universal data formats for electrophysiological studies, challenges persist due to the absence of standardized protocols (notably for current-clamp experiments) and unified data analysis methods, hindering cross-database comparisons of electrophysiological features. To address these limitations, we developed the TACO pipeline, a free, Python-based pipeline for analyzing databases of current-clamp recordings. The TACO pipeline is designed to be user-friendly, minimizing the need for manual implementation of database-specific data extraction methods and enabling the application of user-defined quality control criteria. The pipeline incorporates robust methods for characterizing neuronal I/O relationships, spike-related feature adaptation, and estimating common experimental artifacts such as bridge errors. These methods have been designed to accommodate variability in database-specific experimental design, the sampling of the input space being of particular importance. We validated the utility of this approach by demonstrating performance comparable to or exceeding that of machine learning models reported in the literature for neuronal type classification, using protocol-agnostic features extracted by the pipeline.

To understand the functional impact of this heterogeneity in the brain, network models need to consider how this is manifested at the level of cellular properties, and thus how to consider variability in reported experimental data. Many studies have pointed out the variability in neuronal density, structural organization or synaptic connectivity across different neuronal networks and populations. Similarly, neuronal physiological properties are known to greatly vary across neuronal populations. Yet, the characterization of electrophysiological diversity has mainly relied on descriptions of firing properties (e.g. bursting, spike frequency adaptation) with various quantitative definitions of the boundaries between neuronal classes (e.g. fast spiking, regular spiking). Furthermore, lab specific implementations of experimental design and data analysis are an obstacle for comparisons between studies. In this context, the quantitative consideration of neuronal variability across commonly accepted neuronal classes provides an objective approach to describe neuronal physiological heterogeneity. We analyzed several publicly available databases to characterize the variability of linear and input/output properties of cortical neurons, according to multiple factors covering the entire cortical neuronal population. We assessed the variability of the main cortical neuron types (Excitatory, PValb, Sst, Htr3a, Vip), revealing their heterogeneity as function of cortical area (primary visual, motor and somato-sensory areas), including between layers within a given area. Our comparative database study revealed that different experimental conditions (e.g., in-vitro vs. in-vivo, recording temperature) can influence the properties of any given cell type, while preserving overall differences between types. We find that considering the input to a given neuron in terms of the effective voltage response of a linear model can account for some of the heterogeneity of I/O properties, and suggest that these properties are directly linked to cell input resistance, thus cell size.

While performing the screening of an FDA-approved repurposed library of small molecule inhibitors against the auxotrophic strain Mtb mc2 6206, which lacks leuC-leuD and panC-panD genes, we identified a molecule namely semapimod, which exclusively inhibits growth of the auxotrophic strain, whereas no effect is observed against the wild-type Mtb H37Rv.

In this study, we propose DPStab, a sequence-based deep learning solution that accurately predicts protein stability changes upon single residue mutations. DPStab transfers a protein large language model as a core component and incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to capture the contact changes around mutated positions for {Delta}{Delta}G and {Delta}Tm prediction. To address data imbalance and the antisymmetric nature of mutation effects, DPStab employs a self-distillation inference strategy under the supervision of an antisymmetric constraint. Benchmarking demonstrates that DPStab achieves state-of-the-art performance in both {Delta}{Delta}G and {Delta}Tm prediction. Practical evaluations confirm DPStab's capability in accurately ranking protein stability on large-scale datasets and effectively identifying critical structural contacts impacting stability.

We demonstrated the involvement of the C-terminal transmembrane (TM) and intracellular (IC) domains of the proteinase in the fate of major toxic metabolites of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (e.g., C99, A{beta}). These findings led us to hypothesize that modifying MT5-MMP C-terminal domains could serve as an effective strategy to modulate C99 and A{beta}. To test this, here we generated MT5-MMP variants carrying amino acid deletions or substitutions in entire proteinase domains or in selected amino acid clusters in the IC domain. MT5-MMP variants were co-transfected into human cell lines accumulating C99, reminiscent of an AD setting. We identified mutations in the IC domain that induce C99 degradation and a decrease in A{beta} levels, while other mutations have divergent effects on these APP metabolites. Furthermore, high content imaging revealed the importance of MT5-MMP IC modifications in regulating subcellular trafficking of C99 through the endomembrane system and its consequences for C99 processing. Proximity ligation assays also highlighted the importance of the IC domain in MT5-MMP colocalization and potential interaction with C99. In a translational effort, we synthetized and functionalized peptides that mimic the MT5-MMP IC domain and carry mutations that reduce C99 and/or A{beta} levels. One of these peptides reduced C99 levels in an in vitro AD model. Overall, our study highlights the role of selected amino acids in the C-terminal domains of MT5-MMP as the basis for a better understanding of the proteinase's contribution to C99 and A{beta} metabolism.

Chromatin must be assembled following DNA-based fundamental cellular processes such as replication and transcription to preserve genome integrity. Chromatin assembly is regulated by the orderly engagement of histones with a series of histone chaperones that guide newly synthesized histones from ribosomes to DNA. Although the synthesis of nucleotides and the histone proteins are the two major biosynthetic processes that complete the formation of chromatin, how these processes are coordinated remains unknown. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetases (PRPSs) catalyze the first and rate-limiting step in the nucleotide biosynthesis pathway. PRPS enzymes form a complex with PRPS-associated proteins (PRPSAPs). In the present study, we discover that PRPS-PRPSAP enzyme complex are part of histone chaperone network. We show that PRPS enzymes are essential not only for nucleotide biogenesis, but together with PRPSAP also play a key role in the early steps in the process of histone maturation by regulating the interaction of histone chaperones with histone H3 and H4. Importantly, this regulation is separate from PRPS nucleotide biosynthetic activity. Depletion of PRPS proteins leads to limited histone availability and impaired chromatin assembly.

Upregulation of lipolysis by glucose is blunted in human islets affected by type 2 diabetes. Here, we aim to determine how glucose regulates lipolysis in beta cells. We found that glucose recruits alpha/beta hydrolase domain containing 5 (ABHD5), a co-activator of PNPLA2 to LDs where lipolysis occurs. ABHD5 recruitment to LDs was reduced by the addition of H-89 and the expression of a mutant ABHD5 that is resistant to phosphorylation by a cAMP dependent kinase (PKA) indicating partial dependence of recruitment on PKA. Importantly, ABHD5 was indispensable for glucose responsiveness of lipolysis in INS-1 832/13 (INS-1) cells. Downregulation of ABHD5 increased LDs and TG content in INS-1 cells and human islets indicating that ABHD5 is highly active in beta cells. Additionally, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was impaired in ABHD5 downregulated INS-1 and human pseudoislets, which agrees with impaired GSIS in ATGL downregulated beta cells.

However, common microalgal cultivation conditions differ in temperature and salinity from mammalian cell cultivation environments, making co-cultivation short-lived and challenging. We screened several different microalgae species to identify locally isolated Chlorella BDH-1 as candidate that has high growth rates in mammalian culture conditions while, unlike other Chlorella species, does not compete for glucose as an energy source. In mammalian cell co-culture, BDH1 reduces cellular waste products, stabilizes pH, doubles culture longevity, increases growth performance up to 80%, and reduces expensive and ethically challenging foetal bovine serum requirements. Chlorella BDH-1 was also non-inflammatory and tolerant of clinical antibiotics. Collectively, mammalian cell/BDH1 co-cultivation improves tissue culture health and reduces costs, paving the path for applications in the biotechnology and medical sectors.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

However, even under carefully controlled conditions, stem cell-derived models exhibit substantial \"inter-individual\" heterogeneity. Focusing on gastruloids, a powerful model of the early posterior embryo, we sought to investigate the origins of this heterogeneity. To this end, we developed a scalable protocol for generating gastruloids that are monoclonal, i.e. derived from a single mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC). Single cell transcriptional profiling of monoclonal gastruloids revealed extensive inter-individual heterogeneity, with some hardly progressing, others resembling conventional gastruloids but biased towards mesodermal or neural lineages, and yet others bearing cell types rare or absent from conventional polyclonal gastruloids. To investigate this further, we leveraged DNA Typewriter to record the cell lineage relationships among the mESCs from which monoclonal gastruloids originate. Early in the expansion of \"founder\" mESCsprior to induction of the resulting aggregates to form gastruloidswe observe clear examples of fate bias or fate restriction, i.e. sister clades that exhibit markedly different cell type compositions. In a separate experiment with DNA Typewriter, we reconstructed a monophyletic \"tree of trees\", composed of ~50,000 cells derived from ~100 gastruloids, all descended from a single \"founder of founders\" stem cell. From these data, we find that founder mESCs that are more closely related are more likely to give rise to monoclonal gastruloids with similar cell type compositions. Our results suggest that fluctuations in the intrinsic states of mESCs are heritable, and shape their descendants' fates across many cell divisions. Our study also showcases how DNA Typewriter can be used to reconstruct high-resolution, monophyletic cell lineage trees in stem cell models of early development.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Concomitantly, cholinergic increase in E:I ratio in LPFC may support working memory representations. The role of ACh in gain modulation has been observed in macaque primary visual cortex, rodent prefrontal and olfactory cortices, and medial temporal lobe areas.

As a frequent target for mutation in cardiocutaneous syndromes that vary widely in phenotype, DP's roles as a signaling hub are rapidly emerging. Here, we identify the RhoGEF Ect2 as a previously unappreciated binding partner of the desmosomal protein DP. DP is required for the localization of Ect2 to keratinocyte desmosomes and cardiac intercalated discs in vitro and in vivo, where it maintains active RhoA (Rho-GTP) at the membrane. We demonstrate further that Ect2 activity is supported by PKC in a DP-dependent manner in cardiac myocytes. Finally, a truncated form of DP expressed in patients with Carvajal syndrome associated with severe cardiocutaneous defects is impaired in its ability to bind and localize Ect2 to cell junctions in cardiomyocytes and keratinocytes isolated from patients. Our findings delineate an important relationship between a component of the desmosome and a critical regulator of actin cytoskeletal remodeling that could have widespread implications for understanding cardiac and cutaneous health and disease pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Given the alkylating effector metabolites, we hypothesize that defects in interstrand crosslink (ICL) and double strand break (DSB) DNA repair may serve as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity to CP-506. Here, we evaluated the role of DNA damage repair pathways in the antitumor response to CP-506. Isogenic cancer cell lines proficient or deficient in the Fanconi Anemia (FA), homologous recombination (HR), or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway were cultured as 2D monolayers and 3D spheroids. Cell viability, clonogenic cell survival, and spheroid growth inhibition were assessed following CP-506 exposure. Mice bearing subcutaneous isogenic xenografts received CP-506 (600 mg/kg; QD5) or vehicle treatment upon reaching a tumor starting volume (SV) of 244.9 {+/-} 72.0 mm3. Treatment response was quantified as time to reach 4xSV (T4xSV) and respective enhancement ratios (ER), defined as T4xSVCP-506/T4xSVvehicle. DNA damage and repair capacity were evaluated by {gamma}H2AX and alkaline comet assays. In vitro, cell lines deficient in FA or HR, but not NHEJ, showed enhanced sensitivity to CP-506 compared to parental cells in viability and clonogenic assays. This was confirmed in spheroid growth inhibition studies. In vivo, the antitumor response to CP-506 was more pronounced (P<0.0001) in LNCaP AR FANCA-/- (ER 4.0{+/-} 1.1) and LNCaP AR FANCD2-/- (ER 3.4{+/-} 0.8) xenografts compared to parental LNCaP AR (ER 1.5{+/-} 0.5) xenografts. CP-506 treatment of DLD-1 BRCA2-/- (2.9{+/-} 0.7; P<0.0001) xenografts resulted in significantly enhanced ER compared to parental (1.3{+/-} 0.2) xenografts. Similar results were obtained in HCT116 BRCA2-/- (ER 4.0{+/-} 0.6; P<0.0001) versus parental (ER 1.7{+/-} 0.6) xenografts. In contrast, the ER of HCT116 DNA-PKcs-/- (1.4{+/-} 0.3; P=0.18) xenografts was not different from HCT116 parental xenografts. Under anoxic conditions, CP-506 caused elevated {gamma}H2AX foci counts in FANCA- (2.0-fold increase at 48 hours) and FANCD2-deficient cells (1.4-fold increase at 72 hours) compared to LNCaP AR parental cells (P<0.0001). Similarly, {gamma}H2AX expression was increased in DLD-1 BRCA2-/- cells, but not in HCT116 BRCA2-/- cells, compared to their respective parental cells. In xenografts, FA- and HR-deficiency caused elevated {gamma}H2AX expression compared to respective parental tumors (1.6-9.3-fold increase). HCT116 DNA-PKcs-/- cells and xenografts displayed reduced {gamma}H2AX expression compared to their parental counterpart, with an 0.5-fold reduction. The comet assay confirmed CP-506-induced ICLs and DNA strand breaks but was unable to explain the differential therapeutic responses of CP-506 among isogenic tumor cells. Deficiencies within FA or HR, but not NHEJ, enhanced the antitumor effects of CP-506 through a mechanism consistent with the concept of synthetic lethality. Therefore, both DNA repair status and the presence of tumor hypoxia represent key biomarkers for patient stratification in clinical trials of CP-506.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

A.; Dubey, V.; Seal, S.; Aggarwal, R.; Sai, H.; Shenoy, N. K.", "abstract": "The anti-tumor effect of high-dose ascorbic acid (AA) has been demonstrated in multiple in vitro and in vivo cancer models with the postulation of two primary categories of mechanisms: antioxidant/cofactor activity and H2O2-mediated oxidative damage. Both mechanisms have been conclusively demonstrated in vitro. However, while parenteral high-dose AA-induced cofactor activity (TET-mediated DNA demethylation and prolyl/ asparaginyl hydroxylase-mediated HIF activity inhibition via reduction of enzymatic Fe3+ to Fe2+) has been demonstrated intratumorally in vivo in multiple models, the cumulative data on parenteral high-dose AA-induced intratumoral oxidative damage in vivo has been inconclusive. Furthermore, the relative contribution of the seemingly opposing mechanisms towards in vivo anti-cancer activity has not been studied concurrently. We therefore sought to definitively delineate the roles of both antioxidant/ cofactor activity and prooxidant functions of high-dose AA in the in vivo anti-tumor response. Using two syngeneic mouse tumor models, the AA-sensitive A20 model and the AA-resistant Renca model, we assessed markers of DNA and lipid oxidative damage as well as the specific roles of TET2 and AA transporter SLC23A2 in the anti-tumor response to parenteral high-dose AA. In the sensitive A20 model, loss of either Tet2 or Slc23a2 fully reversed anti-tumor activity. Similarly, overexpression of Tet2 in the resistant Renca model (which expresses high baseline levels of AA transporters SLC23A1 and SLC23A2, but does not express TET2), resulted in increased CD8+T cell infiltration and dramatic reduction in tumor growth overall. In both A20 and Renca models, high-dose parenteral AA increased total intratumoral antioxidant capacity, and this was attenuated by Slc23a2 knockdown in A20. High-dose AA treatment also resulted in a Tet2- and Slc23a2-dependent increase in intratumoral 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Intracellular oxidative damage markers, 8-OHdG and 4-HNE, were not induced in tumors by high-dose AA in either model. In contrast, these markers were robustly induced in vitro by high-dose AA in A20 and Renca cells. Using dynamic real-time extracellular H2O2 measurements with high-dose AA, difference in molecular oxygen concentration between standard in vitro and hypoxic in vivo conditions was identified as an important factor underlying the marked discrepancy between the abundant in vitro and absent in vivo intratumoral oxidative stress with high-dose AA. Furthermore, using additional syngeneic models resistant (MB49) and sensitive (MC38) to AA-induced potentiation of anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibition, we demonstrate that very low catalase expression does not confer sensitivity to high-dose AA in vivo (further arguing against the H2O2 mechanism in vivo), that TET2 expression alone is not sufficient to drive an AA-induced anti-tumor response (either as a single agent or in combination with immunotherapy), and that high-dose AA can significantly enhance the efficacy of anti-PD1 immunotherapy even in the absence of single-agent activity. Our data strongly indicate that the in vivo anti-tumor effect of high-dose parenteral AA- including potentiation of immunotherapy- is mediated primarily by its specific antioxidant/ cofactor activity (with TET2 expression likely being necessary but certainly not sufficient), and not via oxidative stress. Collectively, the study represents a paradigm shift in our understanding of the cumulative mechanisms of in vivo anti-cancer activity of high-dose AA, with critical implications not just for the clinical translation of AA as an anti-cancer agent (including in enhancing immunotherapy efficacy) but also the field of free radical biology.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

This study investigated whether resistance development is associated with DNA methylation changes and assessed the potential of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine (DAC) to reverse these alterations and enhance chemosensitivity. Methods: Molecular profiling and functional assays were used to characterize paclitaxel- (PAC) and doxorubicin- (DOX) resistant BC cell lines derived from luminal A (T-47D), triple-negative (MDA-MB-231), and HER2-positive trastuzumab-resistant (JIMT-1) models.

DNA methylation-associated gene expression changes were analyzed through integrative approaches. Results: Chemoresistant cells exhibited a slow-cycling phenotype, reduced tumorigenicity, and extensive genomic alterations. Upregulation of RELB and downregulation of PPARG were observed across several resistant cell lines, while CDA expression was uniformly elevated in all DOX-resistant models. PAC-resistant xenografts displayed widespread methylation and transcriptomic reprogramming. DAC treatment partially restored aberrant methylation patterns and increased Ki-67 expression, potentially enhancing DOX responsiveness.

Here, we integrate multi-modal electrophysiological analysis with transcriptomic profiling to analyze the aperiodic slope in both normal and glioma-infiltrated cortex. We determine that glioma infiltration induces a flattening of the aperiodic slope, indicating a shift toward excitation dominance that varies according to tumor subtype and correlates with impairments in semantic naming. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed that cortical regions with flat aperiodic slope exhibit transcriptional programs enriched in glutamatergic signaling, membrane depolarization, and excitatory synaptic transmission.

Previously, we and others reported that FANCM, one of the Fanconi Anemia proteins, plays a critical role in suppressing replication stress and DNA damage at ALT telomeres by actively disrupting TERRA R-loops [1-4]. Here, we showed that inactivation of DNA2 in ALT-positive (ALT+) cells, but not in telomerase-positive (TEL+) cells, induces a robust increase of replication stress and DNA damage at telomeres, which leads to a pronounced increase of many ALT properties, including telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs), ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs), and C-circles. We further demonstrated that depletion of DNA2 induces a pronounced increase of TERRA R-loops and a decrease in replication efficiency at ALT telomeres. Most importantly, we uncovered a strong additive genetic interaction between DNA2 and FANCM in the ALT pathway. Furthermore, co-depletion of DNA2 and FANCM causes synthetic lethality in ALT+ cells, but not in TEL+ cells, suggesting that targeting DNA2 and FANCM could be a viable strategy to treat ALT+ cancers. Finally, utilizing the single-molecule telomere assay via optical mapping (SMTA-OM) technology, we thoroughly characterized genome-wide changes in DNA2 deficient cells and FANCM deficient cells and found that most chromosome arms manifested increased telomere length. Unexpectedly, we uncovered many chromosome arm-specific telomere changes in those cells, suggesting that telomeres at different chromosome arms may regulate and respond to replication stress differently.

Despite advances in molecularly targeted therapies and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, clinical outcomes remain suboptimal. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) confer benefit in a subset of AML patients harboring FLT3-ITD mutations, yet relapse and resistance are common. These failures are driven by both intrinsic properties of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) - a quiescent, self-renewing population - and extrinsic cues from the tumor microenvironment. We previously demonstrated that arteriolar endothelial cells (ECs) produce miR-126, which is transferred to LSCs, promoting quiescence, treatment resistance, and niche retention. During disease progression, TNF secreted by expanding blasts suppresses EC miR-126 production, enabling LSCs and their progeny to proliferate. Following TKI administration, blast reduction lowers TNF levels, restoring EC miR-126 production and enabling LSCs to re-enter quiescence - thereby escaping therapy and facilitating relapse. To investigate this dynamic, we developed an agent-based computational model of the AML bone marrow microenvironment, parameterized with in vitro and in vivo data. The model captures vascular niche remodeling and the feedback between leukemic populations and endothelial signaling. Simulations reveal that LSC protection mediated by miR-126 can be overcome by combining TKIs with miRisten, a miR-126 inhibitor. When administered on a defined schedule, this combination disrupts the protective niche and enhances LSC eradication. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting microenvironmental feedback to overcome resistance and prevent AML relapse.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Angiogenesis was augmented in USP20(S334D) mouse aortic rings but reduced in USP20(S334A) mice. By screening known angiogenesis factors, we identified matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP3), a transcriptional target of NF{kappa}B, as a gene that is also regulated by USP20 expression and Ser334 phosphorylation. Inhibiting MMP3 reduced angiogenic sprouting in the Usp20-/- mouse aortic rings. We conclude that USP20 expression inversely correlates with the extent of angiogenesis, and that inhibiting USP20 Ser334 phosphorylation could be a useful strategy to constrain inflammation-driven angiogenesis under pathological circumstances, like cancer and atherosclerosis.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Melanoma-derived lymphatic exosomes play a crucial role in forming a tumor-supportive environment for metastasis, or premetastatic niche, within the first tumor draining lymph node, also known as the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Therefore, analyzing the proteomic content of tumor-draining lymphatic exosomes that deliver oncogenic molecules to the SLN is important in understanding the premetastatic niche. To reveal the proteomic landscape of lymphatic exosomes, we performed multidimension liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with multiplexing (18-samples) using tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling to profile the lymphatic exosomal proteomes obtained from afferent lymphatic channels leading to the SLN of patients with melanoma (n=6), control afferent lymphatic channels from prophylactic mastectomy (n=3) and non-cancer post-operative lymphatic fluid (n=9). Lymphatic fluid from postoperative lymphadenectomy drains served as another control to filter out non-melanoma alteration in lymph that may be related to the procedure of surgical resection and wound healing process. Our proteomic analysis identified 3929 proteins in the lymphatic exosomes, of which 968 were unique proteins absent from the current exosomal database. Interestingly, melanoma lymphatic exosomes possess distinctive proteomic cargo, which is significantly associated with cancer-associated and cellular structural remodeling pathways (FDR <0.05). Moreover, proinflammatory wound healing pathways are predominantly present in melanoma and postoperative lymph fluid compared to normal control afferent lymphatic channels. We identified a total of 17 uniquely modulated proteins in melanoma compared to control and postoperative lymph, which are critically involved in the process of melanoma tumorigenesis. At least ten upregulated proteins strongly correlate with each other at the gene expression levels in melanoma tumors compared to controls and may serve as a signature panel for melanoma (p = 2.13 x 10-58). In summary, this study represents the first comparative analysis of the lymphatic exosomal proteome and highlights distinct exosomal proteins that may support premetastatic niche formation in the SLN.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Despite available therapies against ER+ BC, recurrence occurs in many patients due to therapeutic resistance. Semaphorin 7a (SEMA7A) is a biomarker associated with poor prognosis and endocrine therapy resistance for BC patients. Survival analyses of ER+ BC patients on endocrine therapy confirm early recurrence in patients with SEMA7A+ tumors. Thus, we aim to establish novel treatment strategies to improve outcomes for patients with ER+ SEMA7A+ BC. In this paper we investigate the mechanisms by which SEMA7A promotes resistance to endocrine therapy and its potential as a therapeutic target for ER+ BC. Our studies suggest that SEMA7A binds to integrins {beta}1 and {beta}4 (ITGB1, ITGB4) and activates AKT cell survival signaling via its RGD domain. Using a syngeneic ER+ model, TC11 tumors in FVB/N mice were treated with PI3K inhibitors (20mg/kg alpelisib; 10mg/kg GCT-007), alone or in combination with tamoxifen (0.5 mg/100uL peanut oil). TC11 tumors were also treated with a combination of an anti-SEMA7A antibody (SmAb H1) (100-250mg/kg) and fulvestrant (83mg/kg), compared to single agents. In vivo studies were validated in a second syngeneic ER+ model; SSM2 cells and 129SV-E mice. Our results demonstrate that direct inhibition of SEMA7A via SmAb H1 significantly reduces tumor growth of SEMA7A+ tumors, and the combination with fulvestrant may be even more effective. Our studies suggest that patients with ER+SEMA7A+ tumors should be candidates for PI3K-targeted therapies or anti-SEMA7A-based therapy.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

To survive this inherent genotoxic stress, cancer cells have developed a critical reliance on non-oncogenic stress response pathways to safeguard their genome. Capitalizing on this therapeutic vulnerability, we exploited the dependency of cancer cells on stress-mitigating mechanisms during DNA replication to identify a naturally occurring compound - Molephantin. Here, the derivatization of Molephantin produces NYH002 with cancer-specific toxicity at nanomolar potency. As a small-molecule inhibitor (~450 Da), NYH002 selectively binds the ILF2 complex to disrupt the activity of downstream helicases essential for R-loop resolution. Progressive accumulation of unresolved RNA:DNA hybrids increases the frequency of head-on collisions with the replication machinery, resulting in catastrophic genome-wide DNA double-strand breaks. While elevated cyclin E and E2F1 levels predict NYH002 sensitivity, homologous recombination deficient cancer cells exhibit greater vulnerability, as evidenced by the selective lethality observed in both in vitro and in vivo models.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of TAK-243, a UBA1 inhibitor, and pevonedistat, a NEDD8 inhibitor, in vitro on primary CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from patients with VEXAS syndrome (n=5), myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) (n=10), as well as healthy controls (n=10).

Despite the standard therapy, the survival from diagnosis remains dramatically low, especially due to relapses. Considering their capacity to escape the tumor and to migrate to the subventricular zone through a CXCR4-dependant mechanism, Glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) are considered as responsible for these relapses. CXCR4 regulates biological features associated with tumor progression, including self-renewal, migration and radio-resistance. Importantly, its expression correlates with severity and poor prognosis of several cancers including GBM. CXCR4/CXCL12 pathway appears therefore as an interesting potential therapeutic target. We have generated an oncolytic herpesvirus (oHSV) expressing HA-P2G, a mutated form of CXCL12 previously described as a CXCR4 competitive inhibitor. We demonstrate that in vitro, oHSV/P2G impairs human primary GSCs stemness markers expression, self-renewal and migration.

Here, we show that hepatic c-Fos is induced by insulin after feeding and suppressed by glucagon during fasting in chow-fed mice. In lean mice, adenovirus-mediated c-Fos ectopic expression in the liver is sufficient to cause insulin resistance. In diet-induced obesity or after ectopic expression in hepatocytes, c-Fos promotes MASLD progression by altering PPAR signaling and fatty acid metabolism pathways. Mechanistically, c-Fos drives glycolysis, stress-associated MAPK, and insulin-related PI3K-Akt signaling, exacerbating metabolic dysregulation. In HCC, c-Fos expression correlates with PI3K-Akt, MAPK, and calcium signaling pathways activation.

Despite aggressive chemotherapeutic and surgical therapies, the survival rate is only 25% for patients with detectable lung metastases at diagnosis and only 70% in patients that present without detectable lung metastases. The poor prognosis is due to growth of metastases irrespective of whether they are initially large enough to detect clinically. It is therefore necessary to develop new methods to target the growth of lung micrometastases. An NCI panel of FDA approved oncology drugs was therefore screened using three highly metastatic human osteosarcoma cell lines. To more closely approximate in vivo micro-metastases, the screen used a 3D multicellular in vitro osteosarcoma spheroid (sarcosphere) model. Among 13 hits from the initial screen, we identified the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDI) romidepsin as the most promising inhibitor in secondary screens based on sarcosphere viability. Romidepsin potency was evident with and without standard-of-care chemotherapeutics (MAP: Methotrexate, Adriamycin, Cisplatin) at drug concentrations that are clinically achievable and did not affect non-transformed cells. By those criteria, romidepsin also substantially outperformed the other three FDA approved HDIs and eight HDIs in clinical trials.

However, current analysis methods often depend on engineered features and manual expert review, making them sensitive to technical variations and subjective biases. These limitations highlight the need for a better feature representation to improve performance and reproducibility of applications in large-scale patient cohort analyses.

Chemotherapy is the current standard-of-care (SOC) for advanced PDAC; however, treatment resistance driven by a complex and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) limits its effectiveness. To address mechanisms of resistance, we studied cabozantinib (cabo), a multi-kinase inhibitor approved for several solid tumors. Cabo has shown promise in preclinical PDAC models and clinical trials, particularly when combined with immunotherapy, but its mechanisms of action within the human PDAC TME and its potential to overcome therapy resistance remain unclear. Using CosMx Spatial Molecular Imaging (CosMx SMI) and Orion Multiplex Immunofluorescence (MxIF), we analyzed PDAC tissues collected after first line systemic chemotherapy and the Whipple surgical procedure, as well as from liver or lung metastatic sites from patients with PDAC. To functionally model the TME, we established matched patient-derived organoid (PDO) co-cultures harboring cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and autologous immune cells (IMM) (PDO/CAF/IMM). These models were used to evaluate the effects of cabo and pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, with benchmarking of findings to the patients TME. Spatial analysis of post-chemotherapy and metastatic PDAC tissues revealed heterogeneous cellular neighborhoods within the TME, including enrichment of Schwann cells, CAFs, T regulatory cells, and cancer stem cells (CSCs). Distinct niches were observed in metastatic liver tissues, characterized by mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts, including myCAFs and iCAFs, and CSCs expressing CD44 and TROP2. In PDO/CAF/IMM co-cultures, treatment with cabo in combination with pembrolizumab enhanced cancer cell death by depleting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and promoted cytotoxic T lymphocyte proliferation. Across both patient tissues and treated co-cultures, a persistent SOC-resistant cancer stem cell population emerged that expressed CD44 variant 9 (CD44v9). Taken together, these integrative spatial and organoid-based studies demonstrate that cabo can remodel the PDAC TME and potentiate PD-1 immunotherapy in preclinical models, while resistance associates with a CD44v9+ CSC population, revealing a potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

To address this gap, we conducted spatial proteomic profiling of metastatic lesions from 25 HER2+ mBC patients treated with T-DXd, using the Bruker GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) platform. Regions of interest (ROIs) were segmented by CD45 expression to distinguish immune-rich versus immune-poor compartments, and spatial marker expression was compared between responders (R) and non-responders (NR). Spearman correlation analysis was used to assess spatial coordination among HER2, fibronectin, and immune markers. Non-responders exhibited greater HER2 heterogeneity, lower CD45+ immune infiltration, and consistent upregulation of fibronectin and granzyme B. In both bone and brain metastases, NR tissues showed strong correlations between fibronectin and T cell markers, indicating spatial immune exclusion. In contrast, NR lymph node metastases displayed negative correlations between fibronectin and immune markers and uncoordinated B-T cell clustering, suggesting an alternative resistance mechanism rooted in immune disorganization rather than exclusion. Collectively, these results implicate HER2 heterogeneity, fibrotic immune exclusion, and immune suppression as key drivers of T-DXd resistance across metastatic sites. By integrating spatial proteomics with clinical outcomes, this study provides novel insights into the spatial immune landscape of ADC resistance and identifies actionable biomarkers for patient stratification and combination therapy design, laying a critical foundation for developing biomarker-guided therapies and personalized treatment strategies to overcome ADC resistance in metastatic breast cancer.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

While cells possess the capacity for de novo serine biosynthesis, most transformed cancer cells heavily depend on exogenous serine uptake to sustain their growth, yet the regulatory mechanisms driving this metabolic dependency remain poorly understood. Here, we uncover a novel mechanism by which Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), often overexpressed in prostate cancer, orchestrates a metabolic shift in serine and lipid metabolism through the phosphorylation of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), the rate-limiting enzyme of the serine synthesis pathway (SSP). We demonstrate that PLK1 phosphorylates PHGDH at three specific sites (S512, S513, S517), leading to a marked reduction in its protein level and enzymatic activity. This downregulation of SSP forces cancer cells to increase their reliance on exogenous serine uptake via the ASCT2 transporter, which, in turn, fuels the biosynthesis of lipids, including sphingolipids essential for tumor growth and survival. Targeting the SSP, serine uptake, or downstream lipid biosynthetic pathways may offer promising therapeutic avenues in PLK1-high advanced cancers.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

To identify metabolic vulnerabilities linked to this mutation, we utilized a multi-omics approach in H3K27M-expressing cells, patient-derived cell lines, and mouse models. We show that by reprogramming chromatin landscape the mutation aberrantly induces NFI transcriptional activity, leading to misregulated purine metabolism. The mutation amplifies purine biosynthesis and degradation via the enzymes ATIC and PNP, respectively. Unregulated purine degradation relieves the negative feedback of purines on their own synthesis allowing continuous synthesis, use and degradation making DIPGs reliant on purine biosynthesis. Targeting ATIC reduced tumor progression and improved survival in mice. We propose ATIC as a potential novel target in DIPG.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) CRC constitute 15% of all CRC, and 4% of metastatic CRC, and, while less responsive to conventional chemotherapy, exhibit notable sensitivity to immunotherapy, especially programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab. Despite this, there is a significant need to optimise immunotherapeutic regimens to maximise clinical efficacy and patient quality of life whilst minimising financial burden. In this work, we adapt the mechanistic model developed by Hawi et al. [arXiv:2411.12123 [q-bio.CB]] for locally advanced MSI-H/dMMR CRC to de novo metastatic MSI-H/dMMR CRC (dnmMCRC), deriving model parameters from pharmacokinetic, bioanalytical, and radiographic studies, as well as bulk RNA-sequencing data deconvolution from the TCGA COADREAD and GSE26571 datasets. We finally optimised treatment with pembrolizumab to balance efficacy, efficiency, and toxicity in dnmMCRC, comparing against currently FDA-approved regimens, analysing factors influencing treatment success and comparing immune dynamics to those in locally advanced disease.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

While the transcriptional programs enabling adaptative switching between melanocytic and mesenchymal phenotypes are well characterized, unravelling druggable epigenetic regulators that sustain melanoma cell adaptation and resistance remains crucial. Herein, we identified TRIM24, a bromodomain protein frequently upregulated during melanoma metastatic progression, as a crucial regulator of melanoma cell plasticity towards invasive/resistant states. shRNA-mediated knock-down of TRIM24 or degradation using a TRIM24-specific PROTAC decrease the migratory capacities and increase the sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors of melanoma cells. Integration of transcriptomic (RNA-seq) and epigenomic (ATAC-seq, CUT&Tag) analyses reveals that TRIM24 reprograms the epigenome of melanoma cells, promoting mesenchymal and repressing melanocytic transcriptional programs. We further define a TRIM24-specific transcriptional signature, that is consistently enriched in treatment-resistant mesenchymal subpopulations in melanoma single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Accordingly, analysis of TRIM24 protein expression in melanoma patients highlights that high TRIM24 expression correlates with relapse to adjuvant immunotherapy. Finally, TRIM24 knock-down in immunocompetent mouse models synergises with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Overall, our findings spotlight TRIM24 as a major epigenetic regulator driving melanoma cell dedifferentiation and resistance to therapy, representing a promising druggable target to reverse phenotype switching and resensitize to treatment.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

The goal of this study was to exploit metabolic vulnerabilities induced by the 1p/19q co-deletion for oligodendroglioma therapy and non-invasive imaging. Methods: We used stable isotope tracing, mass spectrometry, and genetic and pharmacological approaches to interrogate [U-13C]-glucose metabolism in patient-derived oligodendroglioma models (SF10417, BT88, BT54, TS603, NCH612). We examined whether tracing [6,6-2H]-glucose metabolism using deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) provided an early readout of treatment response. Results: The expression of the glycolytic enzyme enolase 1 (ENO1; chromosome 1p36.23) was reduced in patient-derived oligodendroglioma cells and patient biopsies due to the 1p/19q co-deletion and histone hypermethylation. Conversely, ENO2 was upregulated, an effect that was driven by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling and ERK1-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of the CIC transcriptional repressor in oligodendrogliomas. Genetic ablation of ENO2 or pharmacological inhibition using POMHEX inhibited proliferation with nanomolar potency but was not cytotoxic to oligodendroglioma cells or tumor xenografts. Mechanistically, ENO2 loss abrogated [U-13C]-glucose metabolism to lactate but shunted glucose towards biosynthesis of serine and purine nucleotides, an effect that was driven by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH). Importantly, the PHGDH inhibitor D8 was synthetically lethal in combination with POMHEX, and the combination induced tumor regression in vivo. Furthermore, DMI of lactate production from [6,6-2H]-glucose provided an early readout of response to combination therapy that preceded MRI-detectable alterations and reflected extended survival. Conclusions: We have identified ENO2 and PHGDH as 1p/19q co-deletion-induced metabolic vulnerabilities in oligodendrogliomas and demonstrated that DMI reports on early response to therapy.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

However, their clinical use is limited by dose-dependent toxicities, particularly cardiotoxicity and secondary malignancies. Aclarubicin (Acla) is an anthracycline derivative that induces chromatin damage while sparing DNA, offering potential therapeutic benefit with reduced long-term toxicity. Methods: We evaluated the anti-tumor efficacy and safety profile of Acla in multiple in vitro pediatric cancer models and in vivo mouse models designed to mimic anthracycline re-treatment following prior doxorubicin (Doxo) exposure. Tumor growth, genotoxic stress, survival, and organ toxicity were assessed. Results: Acla demonstrated robust anti-tumor activity comparable to Doxo across diverse pediatric in vitro models. Unlike Doxo, Acla treatment did not induce significant genotoxic stress. In vivo, mice receiving Acla after Doxo exposure showed no evidence of cumulative cardiotoxicity or end-organ damage. In contrast, a second course of Doxo led to significant toxic mortality, but was surprisingly not attributable to classic cardiac injury. Conclusion: Our study highlights Acla as a promising anthracycline derivative for pediatric cancers, with potent anti-tumor efficacy and a superior safety profile, even following prior anthracycline exposure. These results support continued investigation of chromatin-damaging anthracyclines that can kill pediatric cancer cells without inducing genotoxic stress.

Previous work has shown that the PIWI pathway is crucial for TE suppression in the germline.

To shed light on this conundrum, we examined the PIWI pathway in colon cancer through a combination of bioinformatic analyses and cell-based assays. Shifted Weighted Annotation Network (SWAN) analysis revealed that the pathway experiences significant allelic losses in colon cancer and that PIWIL2, the main catalytic component of the pathway responsible for TE silencing, experiences the highest percent deletions. PIWIL2 is downregulated in colon tumors of advanced stage, nodal metastasis, and in certain subtypes, correlating with poor survival, while it is even downregulated in ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease that predisposes to colon cancer.

Survival rates vary widely between subgroups, with an average overall survival of 70%. Recurrent medulloblastoma is highly aggressive, treatment-resistant, and usually fatal. In addition, current treatments are highly toxic to the developing brain and surviving patients suffer from lifelong side effects. Therefore, novel therapeutic options are urgently needed. Methods: To inform risk-based, personalized therapy, we developed a novel platform called DrugSeq, which allows predictions of drug sensitivities in patients across medulloblastoma subgroups. We used a perturbagen-response dataset to calculate transcriptional response signatures for each drug and compared this to patient medulloblastoma tumor gene expression. We then stratified patients by molecular subgroup and used an ANOVA analysis to identify drugs that selectively targeted each subgroup. Results: We found distinct differences in transcriptional profiles and predicted drug sensitivity for each medulloblastoma subgroup. We identified several kinase inhibitors, epigenetic inhibitors, and several drugs that have been investigated in drug repositioning studies for cancer. Conclusions: We posit that DrugSeq may identify novel therapies and facilitate patient stratification in clinical trials, leading to more successful targeted medulloblastoma therapies that improve tumor response while minimizing late toxicities.

Yet, its role in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of SCLC revealed that deletion of Smarca4 significantly decreased tumor development in this model. Pharmacological inhibition of SMARCA4 decreased the proliferation of preneoplastic neuroendocrine (NE) cells. These effects coincided with reduced expression of the lineage-specific transcription factor, ASCL1, suggesting that disruption of the SMARCA4-ASCL1 axis impairs tumor development. However, Smarca4-deficient tumors, albeit smaller than controls, displayed features associated with malignant progression, including variant histology and the loss of NE differentiation. This prompted us to test the functional role of SMARCA4 in established tumor cells that recapitulate late-stage disease. Intriguingly, whilst Smarca4 knockdown in tumor cells failed to affect their proliferative capacity in vitro, Smarca4 knockdown tumors exhibited enhanced growth following subcutaneous transplantation in athymic nude mice. Interestingly, SMARCA4 knockdown significantly reduced expression and cell-surface display of PVR, a ligand for activating natural killer (NK) cells. These results led to an idea that the enhanced tumor formation was partly owing to altered tumor-NK cell interactions mediated by the SMARCA4-PVR axis in tumor cells. These findings suggest that SMARCA4 plays a temporally distinct role in SCLC, supporting early tumorigenesis but potentially functioning as a tumor suppressor in the later stages. The dramatic differences observed when targeting SMARCA4 in distinct disease states emphasize a need to acknowledge how differences in the timing of alterations can drastically alter tumor evolution.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Treatment of the chemo-sensitive tumors triggered dynamic transcriptional ECM and immune changes and structural modifications of ECM proteins. These changes, observed over twenty-days post-chemotherapy, had relevance to HGSOC patient responses to chemotherapy. Integrating transcriptomics with ECM structure metrics, we identified ECM targets, including lysyl oxidase (LOX), that might enhance chemotherapy in less responsive mouse tumors.

While most of the HR machinery has been characterized, less is known about how chromatin is reorganized and participates in repair.  Here, we use a break-induced replication (BIR) assay, which measures conservative copying of a donor chromosome arm onto a single-ended recipient sequence, to explore a direct role for the SIR2/3/4 (SIR) silent chromatin complex in HR. Specifically, we measure an early step of BIR, D-loop extension, and simultaneously monitor localization of the SIR complex at the initiating DSB and an ectopic donor locus.  Interestingly, we observe an ~four-fold increase in Sir2 and Sir3 protein levels upon DSB induction and detect an enrichment of all three SIR complex subunits at the DSB and donor loci during periods of active D-loop extension. ChIP-seq experiments reveal enrichment of SIR complex subunits that extend up to 15 kb from the DSB site.  This enrichment is substantially reduced in rad51{Delta} and rad52{Delta} mutants that show defects in BIR. Lastly, we show that sir mutations confer slowed D-loop extension kinetics between divergent substrates and increase the rate of mutation during BIR.

Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) is associated with advanced atherosclerotic plaques, but its role in plaque progression remains unclear. To investigate this, we analyzed the role of TWIST1, a key EndMT- driving transcription factor, in plaque development. Using single-cell RNA sequencing of atherosclerotic plaques from hypercholesterolemic mice with inducible deletion of Twist1 from endothelial cells (Twist1ECKO ApoE-/-) we demonstrate that Twist1 regulates endothelial cell heterogeneity by promoting cell states expressing EndMT markers. Cell tracking confirmed that Twist1 induces EndMT in advanced plaques. Mechanistically, we found that TWIST1 contributes to EndMT by promoting endothelial migration and proliferation through the transcriptional coactivator PELP1. Additionally, TWIST1 induces AEBP1 transcription, which upregulates COL4A1 to drive endothelial proliferation. Analyses of murine brachiocephalic plaques show that endothelial Twist1 promotes plaque growth, collagen deposition, and ACTA2-positive cell accumulation, hallmarks of plaque stability, while reducing necrosis and macrophage infiltration, features of plaque instability. Moreover, TWIST1 expression was associated with asymptomatic human carotid atherosclerosis and predicts favourable clinical outcomes. These findings challenge the prevailing view that EndMT destabilizes plaques, by suggesting that TWIST1-driven EndMT can promote plaque stability, offering new insights into atherosclerosis pathophysiology and therapeutic potential.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Central to its ability to metastasize is the Notch signaling pathway, which, when activated through direct cell-cell interactions, propels cells into a metastatic state through mechanisms akin to the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). While the upregulation of miR-222 has been identified as a critical step in this metastatic progression, the mechanism through which this upregulation persists in the absence of active Notch signaling remains unclear. Here we introduce a dynamical system model that integrates miR-222 gene regulation with histone feedback mechanisms.

In the context of vaccination followed by viral infection, such as breakthrough infection, eosinophils have been linked to aberrant Th2 responses like vaccine-enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD). Here, we demonstrate that the lung immune cell composition, cytokine and chemokine repertoire, histopathological profile, and systemic humoral response of breakthrough influenza infection in mice is distinct from that of primary influenza infection or allergic sensitization, canonical Type 1 and 2 immune responses, respectively. Longitudinal comparison of breakthrough infection with allergic sensitization and primary influenza infection demonstrated major differences in lung immunity between treatment groups in female, BALB/c mice. Breakthrough infection mice exhibit lung eosinophil infiltration that peaks at 7-10 days post-challenge, enriched for the Siglec-Fhi subset, but in the absence of overt pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine signals, high viral titers, severe lung lesions, goblet cell hyperplasia, allergic levels of total IgE, or enhanced morbidity. Multiparameter fluorescence imaging corroborated findings from flow cytometry and also unveiled interactions between CD101+Siglec-F+ cells with CD3+ cells in the lung tissue space. Imaging also revealed a marked absence of eosinophil or neutrophil extracellular traps in the lungs of breakthrough infection mice, in contrast with allergic sensitization and primary influenza infection, respectively. Altogether, our findings provide a deeper understanding of the kinetics and cell-cell interplay during non-pathological, balanced Type 1/2 immune responses in vaccinated hosts during breakthrough infection.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

N.", "abstract": "The specific T cell receptors (TCRs) present in an individual determine which antigens can be recognized, and hence a repertoire comprised of a vast number of unique TCRs ensures an effective T cell response can be mounted against a broad range of potential pathogens encountered. To evade the T cell response, pathogens, and viruses in particular, can accrue epitope escape mutations, establishing a host-pathogen 'tug-of-war' between T cell-mediated control and viral evolution. Indeed, the evolutionary significance of TCR diversification in mammals is underscored by the sophisticated molecular machinery - spanning from somatic V(D)J recombination through non-templated nucleotide additions - that establish the TCR repertoire. Yet, whether greater oligoclonality among responding T cells, as is the case for elderly or immunocompromised individuals, might therefore accelerate pathogen immune escape remains unclear. Here, we constructed a computational model of T cell-mediated viral evolution to investigate how the number of unique virus-specific T cells clones impacts the balance between curtailing viral load through cross-reactivity to mutant strains on the one hand, versus promoting the generation of escape variants on the other. The model recapitulated prior experimental findings, such as T cell-dependent emergence of new viral mutants and the progressive decrease in the number of T cell clones present in the response over time. Our model simulations suggested that oligoclonality in the virus-specific T cell response can, if coupled with a resulting increase in viral replication, maximize viral immune escape despite constant mutation rates, revealing a mechanism for how viruses with comparable mutation rates can nonetheless exhibit dramatically different adaption rates within hosts. Taken together, the model results suggest that variations in TCR repertoire diversity, and consequently in the number of pathogen-specific T cell clones within an individual, can have direct, non-linear impacts on viral immune escape.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

These include Feline Infectious Peritonitis Virus (FIPV), which causes a fatal disease in cats. In livestock, porcine CoVs such as Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) and Porcine Epidemic Diarrhoea Virus (PEDV) are the causative agents of an acute enteric disease in piglets with a high mortality rate and a significant impact on the pork industry. In addition, animal CoVs may represent a zoonotic reservoir. Therefore, efficient antiviral strategies are required to inhibit the multiplication of CoVs that infect various animal species. Here, we synthesized 20 small-molecule ligands that target cyclophilins, a family of cellular chaperones hijacked by several viruses including CoVs. We screened their antiviral activity against feline and porcine -CoVs and identified F83233 as a potent inhibitor of FIPV, TGEV and PEDV replication at micromolar concentrations that was effective in feline, porcine, and simian cells.

Here, we examined the dynamics of culture decline in 15 strains of Prochlorococcus, globally abundant marine cyanobacteria, under nitrogen (N) and phosphate (P) starvation. We then ask whether mortality patterns can be related to the evolutionary history of each strain, the geographic location and environmental conditions where it was isolated from, or the copy number of specific acquisition genes. We observed diverse decline patterns across starvation conditions and strains, identifying three differential features: maximum culture fluorescence, the number of fluorescence peaks during the decline stage, and the decline rate. Based on these features, each strain was categorized as being more sensitive to either nitrogen starvation or phosphorus/co-starvation. High light (HL) strains are more sensitive to N starvation, whereas other facets of the strains evolutionary or ecological origin were not correlated with mortality features. Surprisingly, the number of genes known to be involved in either N or P acquisition in each genome was not correlated with starvation sensitivity. Rather, genes involved in DNA damage repair were associated with N sensitivity to starvation, especially in HL strains, whereas genes related to protein quality control were more abundant in LL strains and associated with P/co starvation sensitivity. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized diversity in the dynamics of starvation and mortality across closely related Prochlorococcus strains, potentially driven by differences in the responses to DNA and protein damage.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Leveraging existing microbiome data from the cohort, O. hominis was found to be closely associated with bacterial co-colonisers that are rare in non-carrier individuals, including Suttonella, Helcococcus, Moraxella spp., and Gracilibacteria. Their collective acquisition has a significant impact on the diversity of nasopharyngeal communities that contain O. hominis. Individuals who have not yet acquired O. hominis have a higher abundance of Moraxella (particularly M. lincolnii) than individuals who never acquire O. hominis, suggesting that this could be a precursor state for successful colonisation.

Here, we measure how all amino acid mutations in the HA of a recent human H3N2 influenza strain affect its cell entry function, acid stability, and neutralization by human serum antibodies. We find that epistasis has enabled emergence of antigenic mutations that were detrimental to HA's cell entry function in earlier strains. However, epistasis appears insufficient to overcome the pleiotropic costs of antigenic mutations that impair HA's stability, explaining why some mutations that strongly escape human antibodies never fix in nature.

Genetic resistance is the most effective control strategy, but its quantitative nature and labor-intensive phenotyping make its implementation in breeding programs challenging. This study explored high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with RGB cameras to evaluate a soybean population and identify stink bug resistance by correlating image-derived features and machine learning (ML) models. Using an alpha-lattice design with three replications, we phenotyped 304 soybean lines over two seasons under natural stink bug infestations. We manually evaluated five traits associated with stink bug resistance and correlated them with color, texture, and histogram features from aerial images. Three ML models -AdaBoost, SVM, and MLP -were tested to predict these traits. VIs, especially the Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index at the first percentile (VARI-P25) and texture-based indices at 45{degrees} and 135{degrees}, effectively predicted traits in stressed environments, particularly during flights near maturation. While ML models showed good predictive ability for yield, healthy seed weight, and maturity, they were less effective for stink bug resistance. Increasing the number of UAV flights modestly improved predictive accuracy, though predicting traits across different seasons remained challenging. Despite this, indices like VARI-25P were valuable for screening and excluding less promising genotypes, optimizing breeding program resources. This pioneering work offers valuable insights and highlights the need for further research to optimize resistance selection, promising significant advances in soybean breeding for stink bug resistance.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Recent work has highlighted the value of measuring gene-specific transcriptional variability, or noise, within a genetically identical population of cells in addition to mean expression given that these differences contribute to biological processes including development and disease. However, measuring transcriptional noise remains a challenge. Here, we systematically compared statistical methods by simulating single-cell data by varying both dispersion and count size to assess the relative responsiveness to noise of several commonly used statistical metrics: the Gini index, variance-to-mean ratio, variance, and Shannon entropy. We found that the variance-to-mean ratio scales approximately linearly with increasing dispersion and is scale-invariant. In contrast, the Gini index displayed paradoxical behavior, and Shannon entropy was not scale-invariant. Thus, we next applied the variance-to-mean ratio to measure transcriptional variability in a publicly available single-cell dataset of embryonic hearts from a mouse model of maternal hyperglycemia. Our data show that many genes display transcriptional variability within the same cell type, and that this variation does not correlate with gene characteristics such as transcript level, promoter GC content, or evolutionary gene age. Notably, many of the genes and pathways with highest transcriptional variability were not identified as differentially expressed, and have in fact been implicated in maternal hyperglycemia in other studies, suggesting that transcriptional variability can provide additional biologically relevant information beyond what is observed from studying mean expression alone.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Moreover, many task-specific evaluation metrics used during training often bias the model towards a particular metric -\"metric-leakage\". To overcome these shortcomings, we propose Policy-guided Unbiased REpresentations (PURE) for SCMG that learn within a framework simulating molecular transformations for drug synthesis. PURE combines self-supervised learning with a policy-based reinforcement-learning (RL) framework, thereby avoiding the need for external molecular metrics while learning high-quality representations that incorporate an inherent notion of similarity specific to the given task. Along with a semi-supervised training design, PURE utilizes template-based molecular simulations to better explore and navigate the discrete molecular search space. Despite the lack of metric biases, PURE achieves competitive or superior performance than state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.

In this study, we systematically evaluated the ability of deep learning models to predict histone modifications across plant species using a multi-stage framework based on the Sei architecture. We trained species-specific models for Arabidopsis (A. thaliana), rice (O. sativa), and maize (Z. mays), achieving high within-species predictive performance (AUROC > 0.94) and strong agreement between predictions and experimental ChIP-seq profiles. However, cross-species predictions showed reduced performance with increasing phylogenetic distance, highlighting limited model transferability between monocots and dicots. To improve generalization, we built family-level models by training on multiple species across the Poaceae and Brassicaceae families. These models demonstrated robust predictive power in completely unprofiled species-those entirely unused in training set-highlighting the model's adaptability to novel plant genomes based solely on conserved regulatory syntax. In contrast, cross-family models produced inconsistent results, with reliable performance only in species sharing conserved regulatory features.

Despite extensive theoretical work on spatial population genetics, few empirical methods exist to estimate the components of theoretical models of genetic relatedness in continuous space. One classic model of relatedness in continuous space is the Wright-Malecot model, which predicts that the probability of identity-by-descent decays as a function of geographic distances. The shape of this decay curve is dictated by the dynamics of local dispersal and mating, as well as population density. This model can be reformulated to describe the probability of identity-by-state, in which case it decays to an asymptote, the value of which is determined by the historical demography of the population.

Phenotypic studies of T47D cell lines that express exclusively PR-A or PR-B showed that PR isoforms regulate divergent cell fates. PR-B-expressing cells have a higher proliferation rate, while PR-A-expressing cells produce more mammospheres. We profiled progesterone-driven gene expression in cells grown in both adherent (2D) and mammosphere (3D) growth conditions and found differential gene regulation by PR-A and PR-B that is consistent with the observed divergent phenotypes. Only the PR-A-driven gene signature of ER+ breast cancer cells maintained as non-adherent mammospheres robustly predicted poor clinical outcome in the METABRIC data set. We then performed CUT&RUN to identify the genomic binding patterns unique to each PR isoform and their suite of target genes. Our findings indicate that PR-A acts as a regulator of the cell cycle, while PR-B plays a pivotal role in metabolism and intracellular signaling. Our genomic profiling of PRs in this model system has unveiled novel isoform-specific functions of PR. This work has shifted our prior understanding of the role of PRs in gene regulation, offering potential insights for therapeutic interventions in ER+ breast cancer.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Impaired NaV1.5 expression and function underlie reduced peak Na+ current (INa) and result in ventricular conduction velocity slowing, predisposing the heart to conduction block and ventricular arrhythmias clinically associated with Brugada syndrome (BrS). Recently, a missense mutation in NaV1.5 selectivity filter (DEKA motif), K1419E (DEEA) has been identified in patients with BrS. Despite early characterization of mutations in selectivity filter of other NaV isoforms, little is known about the impact of DEEA on NaV1.5 function as well as on cardiac electrophysiology. Therefore, we generated a mouse heterozygous for NaV1.5 DEEA to characterize the mutation and investigate the outcome of this functionally deficient NaV1.5 variant on cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmias. Heterologous expression system and isolated cardiomyocytes revealed lower current density and unchanged NaV1.5 expression in DEEA vs. wild type (DEKA). On the organ level, optical mapping revealed conduction velocity slowing in DEEA hearts, which was accentuated by flecainide resulting in vivo ventricular arrhythmias. Overall, to our knowledge, we provide the first mechanistic insight into the proarrhythmic consequences of a functionally deficient BrS mutation in NaV1.5.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

HIV latency is maintained through chromatin-mediated repression, making epigenetic regulators attractive therapeutic targets. To identify new modulators of latency, we screened a focused library of 84 chromatin-targeting small molecules. This screen identified BAY-299, a bromodomain inhibitor selective for TAF1 and BRD1, as a latency-modulating compound. BAY-299 reactivated HIV expression and enhanced the efficacy of established latency-reversing agents (LRAs), including vorinostat, prostratin, and iBET-151, in cell line models. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout experiments demonstrated that TAF1, but not BRD1, is essential for maintaining HIV latency and that TAF1 depletion selectively increases HIV transcription with minimal effects on host gene expression. Dual knockout of TAF1 and Tat revealed that the reactivation effect is partially Tat dependent. CUT&RUN analysis further showed that TAF1 depletion increases RNA Polymerase II occupancy across the HIV gene body, suggesting enhanced transcriptional elongation.

Traditional optimization methods are resource-intensive and often fail to adjust the purification process parameters to maximize the resulting product yield and quality. To address this challenge, we developed a machine learning framework that leverages Bayesian optimization to systematically refine affinity chromatography parameters (sample load, flow rate, and the formulation of chromatographic media) to improve AAV purification. The efficiency of this closed-loop workflow in iteratively optimizing the vector's yield, purity, and transduction efficiency was demonstrated by purifying clinically-relevant serotypes AAV2, AAV5, and AAV9 from HEK293 cell lysates using the affinity adsorbent AAVidity. We show that three cycles of Bayesian optimization elevated yields from a baseline of 70% to 99%, while reducing host-cell impurities by 230-to-400-fold across all serotypes. The optimized parameters consistently produced vectors with high purity and preserved high transduction activity, essential for therapeutic efficacy and safety, demonstrating serotype versatility - a key challenge in AAV manufacturing.

Here, we exploit a TurboID-based proximity labeling combined with mass spectrometry to systematically map the interactome of eIF2A during homeostasis and stress. Combining polysome gradients with TurboID, we zoom into the interactions of eIF2A with the 40S small ribosomal subunit and map the eIF2A binding site close to the mRNA entry channel. We identify a network of interactors that link eIF2A to ribosome-associated quality control, including its strong interaction with G3BP1-USP10 complexes as well as RPS2 and RPS3. In the absence of eIF2A, RPS2 and RPS3 ubiquitination is diminished specifically upon ribosome stalling. 40S-specific footprinting in eIF2A knockout cells shows minimal changes in 5`UTR occupancy, consistent with a limited role for eIF2A in translation initiation. Using dynamic SILAC mass spectrometry, we characterize the novel function of eIF2A in ribosome-associated quality control and show that eIF2A antagonizes USP10-dependent rescue of 40S ribosomes, resulting in altered turnover of 40S subunits upon cellular stress. Collectively, our study identifies a previously unknown link between eIF2A and ribosome-associated quality control, implies that eIF2A promotes translation fidelity by tuning 40S ribosome rescue under stress and warrants further investigations into the role of ribosome-associated quality control in tumorigenesis.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

We find that IGH genetic variants establish gene usage biases at the pro-B stage that persist throughout development. In contrast, IGK and IGL repertoires are extensively remodeled during maturation, consistent with receptor editing. Surprisingly, IGH variants also exert trans effects on light chain gene usage, suggesting coordinated constraints on heavy-light chain pairing. Principal component and allele-specific analyses reveal that genetics primarily shapes the heavy chain repertoire, while selection more strongly influences light chain diversity.

Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that the peptides in the drift tube can adopt multiple stable conformations and that the two modes correspond to predominantly extended (mostly helical) and more compact (globular and less ordered) conformations.

However, resolving the uncertainty between GWAS association and causality remains a significant challenge. The small subset of noncoding GWAS variants with causative effects on gene regulatory elements can only be detected through accurate methods that assess the impact of DNA sequence variation on gene regulatory activity. Deep learning models, such as those based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transformers, have gained prominence in predicting the regulatory effects of genetic variants, particularly in enhancers, by learning patterns from genomic and epigenomic data. Despite their potential, selecting the most suitable model is hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks, consistent training conditions, and performance evaluation criteria in existing reviews. Results: This study evaluates state-of-the-art deep learning models for predicting the effects of genetic variants on enhancer activity using nine datasets stemming from MPRA, raQTL, and eQTL experiments, profiling the regulatory impact of 54,859 SNPs across four human cell lines. The results reveal that CNN models, such as TREDNet and SEI, consistently outperform other architectures in predicting the regulatory impact of SNP. However, hybrid CNN-transformer models, such as Borzoi, display superior performance in identifying causal SNPs within a linkage disequilibrium block. While fine-tuning enhances the performance of transformer-based models, it remains insufficient to surpass CNN and hybrid models when evaluated under optimized conditions.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Using a machine learning approach, we demonstrate that NSP5 variants differ significantly in their propensity to phase-separate. We engineered a variant incorporating amino acid signatures from strains with low LLPS tendency, which failed to phase separate in vitro yet supported the formation of replicative condensates in recombinant viruses in cells. Low-tendency LLPS strains require phosphorylation of NSP5 to nucleate phase separation, whereas high-tendency strains do not, suggesting distinct nucleation mechanisms.

Here, we use the Skin Tumor Array by Micro-Poration (STAMP) model to investigate how cDC1-T cell interactions shape immune responses and influence tumor fate. Our data reveal that it is the spatial distribution of both cDC1s and T cells that determines whether a tumor can be rejected. We defined three primary immunotypes based on the spatial distribution of T cells and cDC1s: T cell-inflamed/dendritic cell-inflamed (TC-In/DC-In) tumors, where T cells and cDC1s co-infiltrate the tumor; T cell-inflamed/dendritic cell-excluded (TC-In/DC-Ex) tumors, where T cells infiltrate but cDC1s remain at the periphery; and T cell-excluded/dendritic cell-excluded (TC-Ex/DC-Ex) tumors, which lack both cDC1 and T cell infiltration. Notably, TC-In/DC-In tumors are more likely to undergo rejection, whereas TC-In/DC-Ex tumors persist despite T cell infiltration. Within TC-In/DC-In tumors, cDC1s engage in direct interactions with T cells, upregulate co-stimulatory molecules, and sustain effector T cell responses, while cDC1s in TC-In/DC-Ex tumors express higher migration-associated genes, suggesting a propensity to exit the tumor. We further show that chemokine modulation, particularly through CXCL9, CCL5, and XCL1, can reshape immune infiltration patterns to promote intra-tumoral cDC1-T cell clustering and improve tumor rejection.

Drosophila melanogaster Misato-Like protein (DML1) plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial function, yet its function in filamentous fungi remains unexplored. In this study, we characterized FgDML1 in F. graminearum. FgDML1 interacts with the mitochondrial fission and fusion protein FgDnm1 to maintain mitochondrial stability, thereby positively regulating acetyl-CoA levels and ATP synthesis, which influences toxisome formation and ultimately affects DON toxin biosynthesis. Additionally, FgDML1 is involved in the regulation of toxin biosynthetic enzyme expression. In the {Delta}FgDML1 mutant, Complex III enzyme activity decreased, overexpression of complex III assembly factors FgQCR2, FgQCR8, and FgQCR9 may induce conformational changes in the Qi-site protein, specifically altering the sensitivity of F. graminearum to respiratory inhibitor cyazofamid not Qo-site inhibitor pyraclostrobin and other fungicides. Furthermore, the loss of FgDML1 leads to defects in nutrient utilization, as well as in asexual and sexual reproduction, and pathogenicity.

Silencing Defective 2 (SDE2) is an essential human protein involved in multiple aspects of genome regulation, including DNA repair, ribosome biogenesis, and mRNA splicing. SDE2 is expressed with an N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (SDE2UBL) which must be proteolytically cleaved to release the functional C-terminal domain (SDE2CT). This cleavage not only activates SDE2CT but also marks it for subsequent degradation, highlighting the importance of this tightly regulated processing. Despite the crucial role of this cleavage event, the human protease responsible has remained unknown. Here, we identify that the deubiquitinating enzyme, ubiquitin-specific protease 5 (USP5), catalyses the cleavage of SDE2. Using an integrated workflow combining biochemical assays, proteomic profiling, and mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that USP5 selectively processes SDE2 in vitro and in cell. To validate the specificity of this interaction, we engineered SDE2UBL into an activity-based probe, and developed a cellular reporter assay, both of which confirmed USP5 as the primary effector. Biophysical analysis further revealed that SDE2UBL binds to USP5 with similar characteristics to ubiquitin, albeit with reduced affinity, supporting a mechanism of substrate mimicry. Together, these findings uncover a novel regulatory axis for SDE2 function, highlighting an underappreciated role for DUBs in regulating protein maturation events. They also establish a versatile approach for identifying and validating substrate-protease interactions with broader implications for the study of post-translational regulation.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

Embryoid bodies (EBs) are self-organizing multicellular structures that recapitulate aspects of early mammalian embryogenesis. We set out to perform a CRISPR screen perturbing all transcription factors (TFs) in murine EBs. Specifically, a library of TF-targeting guide RNAs (gRNAs) was used to generate mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) bearing single TF knockouts. Aggregates of these mESCs were induced to form mouse EBs, such that each resulting EB was 'mosaic' with respect to the TF perturbations represented among its constituent cells. Upon performing single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on cells derived from mosaic EBs, we found many TF perturbations exhibiting large and seemingly significant effects on the likelihood that individual cells would adopt certain fates, suggesting roles for these TFs in lineage specification. However, to our surprise, these results were not reproducible across biological replicates. Upon further investigation, we discovered cellular bottlenecks during EB differentiation that dramatically reduce clonal complexity, curtailing statistical power and confounding interpretation of mosaic screens. Towards addressing this challenge, we developed a scalable protocol in which each individual EB is monoclonally derived from a single mESC and genetically barcoded. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we show how these monoclonal EBs enable us to better quantify the consequences of TF perturbations as well as 'inter-individual' heterogeneity across EBs harboring the same genetic perturbation. Looking forward, monoclonal EBs and EB-derived organoids may be powerful tools not only for genetic screens, but also for modeling Mendelian disorders, as their underlying genetic lesions are overwhelmingly constitutional (i.e. present in all somatic cells), yet give rise to phenotypes with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}

To test this, we focused on HES1 and HES5, oscillatory, cross-repressive TFs that regulate neural progenitor maintenance and are expressed in adjacent dorsoventral domains in the developing spinal cord. Using live-cell imaging of fluorescent reporters and computational modelling, we show that HES1 and HES5 co-express and oscillate in-phase within single cells. Differences in protein stability result in distinct free-running periodicity, but co-expression results in entrainment and phase-locking. Modulating cross-repression strength and/or abundance shifts the system towards bistability and dominance of a single TF oscillator.

Recent advances in both sequencing and genotyping technologies has resulted in a considerable increase in the number of publicly available human ancient DNA datasets, creating new opportunities for development of methods for the inference of NFDS from time-sampled data. In this perspective, I present three brief simulation studies to show how time-sampled data can aid improve inference power. First, I show how multiple time points can help us distinguish between recent NFDS and partial selective sweeps based on allele frequency trajectories. I then demonstrate how selective effects can be distinguished from population history based on changes in genetic variation and the site frequency spectrum over time. Finally, I apply an approximate Bayesian computation approach to compare the power of multiple and single time point datasets in estimating the time for which NFDS has been shaping variation for. Thus, I show how data from multiple timepoints can facilitate the generation of new methodological approaches for better inference of NFDS.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}
{"title": "From Likelihood to Fitness: Improving Variant Effect Prediction in Protein and Genome Language Models", "doi": "10.1101/2025.05.20.655154", "authors": "Pugh, C. W. J.; Nunez-Valencia, P. G.; Dias, M.; Frazer, J.", "abstract": "Generative models trained on natural sequences are increasingly used to predict the effects of genetic variation, enabling progress in therapeutic design, disease risk prediction, and synthetic biology. In the zero-shot setting, variant impact is estimated by comparing the likelihoods of sequences, under the assumption that likelihood serves as a proxy for fitness. However, this assumption often breaks down in practice: sequence likelihood reflects not only evolutionary fitness constraints, but also phylogenetic structure and sampling biases, especially as model capacity increases. We introduce Likelihood-Fitness Bridging (LFB), a simple and general strategy that improves variant effect prediction by averaging model scores across sequences subject to similar selective pressures. Assuming an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of evolution, LFB can be viewed as a way to marginalize the effects of genetic drift, although its benefits appear to extend more broadly. LFB applies to existing protein and genomic language models without requiring retraining, and incurs only modest computational overhead. Evaluated on large-scale deep mutational scans and clinical benchmarks, LFB consistently improves predictive performance across model families and sizes. Notably, it reverses the performance plateau observed in larger protein language models, making the largest models the most accurate when combined with LFB. These results suggest that accounting for phylogenetic and sampling biases is essential to realizing the full potential of large sequence models in variant effect prediction.", "date": "2025-05-24", "journal": ""}
