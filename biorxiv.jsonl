To control the false discovery rate (FDR), these studies typically apply a statistical method called the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) method. However, BH can be overly conservative, particularly in small-sample studies, and it does not take advantage of relevant structural information among the hypotheses, such as groupings. Group structures can arise, for example, when genomic features located in close proximity are co-regulated. Recent statistical developments have yielded group-adaptive BH methods that can leverage pre-existing group information to improve statistical power while maintaining FDR control. However, these methods remain underutilized in bioinformatics practice. In this study, we illustrate the practical application of group-adaptive BH methods using a previously published, moderately scaled microRNA (miRNA) dataset. Even under simple groupings based on chromosomal location, these methods identified more miRNAs with significantly deregulated expression (FDR-adjusted p-value <0.05) compared to the traditional BH method. Most of the new discoveries are supported by prior literature and a related 2017 study. Although sensitivity to grouping strategy varied across methods, our control analysis indicated that, for most methods, the additional detections may be attributable to the incorporation of group information. Our results highlight the potential of specialized BH methods for controlling the FDR in omics studies with pre-defined group structures, and motivate further evaluation of their generalizability across diverse datasets.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

The interaction between TFs and their binding sites is highly specific and context dependent. Most of the existing TFBS finding tools are not accurate enough to discover these binding sites in plants. They fail to capture the cross-species variability, interdependence between TF structure and its TFBS, and context specificity of binding. Since they are coupled to predefined TF specific model/matrix, they are highly vulnerable towards the volume and quality of data provided to build the motifs. All these software make a presumption that the user input would be specific to any particular TF which renders them of very limited use for practical applications like genomic annotations of newly sequenced species. Here, we report an explainable Deep Encoders-Decoders generative system, PTF-V[a]c, founded on a universal model of deep co-learning on variability in binding sites and TF structure, PTFSpot, making it completely free from the bottlenecks mentioned above. It has successfully decoupled the process of TFBS discovery from the prior step of motif finding and requirement of TF specific motif models. Due to the universal model for TF:DNA interactions as its guide, it can discover the binding motifs in total independence from data volume, species and TF specific models. In a comprehensive benchmarking study across a huge volume of experimental data, it has outperformed most advanced motif finding deep learning (DL) algorithms. With this all, PTF-V[a]c brings a completely new chapter in ab-initio TFBS discovery through generative AI.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we discovered a strong intra-genomic correlation among bacterial pan-genes within each of Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Campylobacter jejuni. With a convolutional neural network assisted core genome knock-out simulation, we found that different combinations of fewer than 20 highly variable core genes could recover the sub-species type classified by complete core genome with accuracy >95%. This observation led us to test the genes-to-genes predictability: with more than 52,000 assemblies from each species, combinations of highly variable core genes could predict the sequence variants of other core genes (average accuracy >94%) within the same genome and could also predict sequence variants (average accuracy >91%) as well as the presence (average AUROC >0.91) of some accessory genes. Furthermore, combinations of highly variable core genes could also predict multiple antibiotic resistances (AUROC >0.80) in large published datasets of E. coli, S. aureus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Collectively, we propose that genes within the same genome can strongly correlate with each other. Therefore, the strain phylogeny and the status of other genes could be uniformly represented by combinations of highly variable core genes, which could further represent certain phenotypes including in vitro resistance.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Chunking can be learned over time for familiar inputs; however, it can also arise spontaneously for novel stimuli. Such on-the-fly structuring is crucial for cognition, yet the underlying neural mechanism remains unclear. Here we introduce a synaptic theory of chunking, in which short-term synaptic plasticity enables the formation of chunk representations in working memory. We show that a specialized population of \"chunking neurons\" selectively controls groups of stimulus-responsive neurons, akin to gating. As a result, the network maintains and retrieves the stimuli in chunks, thereby exceeding the basic capacity. Moreover, we show that our model can dynamically construct hierarchical representations within working memory through hierarchical chunking. A consequence of this proposed mechanism is a new limit on the number of items that can be stored and subsequently retrieved from working memory, depending only on the basic working memory capacity when chunking is not invoked. Predictions from our model were confirmed by analyzing single-unit responses in epileptic patients and memory experiments with verbal material.

Despite its comparatively simple composition relative to other human microbiota systems, the mechanisms underpinning the dynamics and stability of vaginal microbial communities remain elusive. A crucial, yet so far underexplored, aspect of vaginal microbiota ecology is the role played by nutritional resources. Glycogen and its derivatives, produced by vaginal epithelia, are accessible to all bacterial constituents of the microbiota. Concurrently, free sialic acid and fucose offer supplementary nutritional resources to bacterial strains capable of cleaving them from glycans, which are structurally integral to mucus. Notably, bacteria adept at sialic acid exploitation are often correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and are frequently implicated in bacterial vaginosis (BV). In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical model tailored to human vaginal microbiota dynamics to explore the interactions between bacteria and their respective nutritional landscape. Our resource-based model examines the impact of the relative availability of glycogen derivatives (accessible to all bacterial species) and sialic acid (exclusive to some BV-associated bacteria) on the composition of the vaginal microbiota. Our findings elucidate that the success of BV-associated bacteria is intricately linked to their exclusive access to specific nutritional resources. This private access fortifies communities dominated by BV-associated bacteria, rendering them resilient to compositional transitions. We empirically corroborate our model prediction with longitudinal clinical data on microbiota composition and previously unpublished metabolomic profiles obtained from a North American cohort.

We show that CASTER-DTA represents a state-of-the-art improvement on multiple benchmarks for predicting drug-target affinity and that it generates novel insights for several related tasks. We then apply CASTER-DTA to create a large resource of the binding affinities of every FDA-approved drug against every protein in the human proteome and make these predictions freely available for download.

Identification of genomic elements for immunity will enable future controlled crossbreeding programs using molecular breeding methods. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide comparison among Nelore, Gir, and Hereford breeds using their whole-genome sequences, majorly focusing on immune-related structural and sequence variation. Our aims were to catalog insertions, deletions, and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that intersect immune loci and known quantitative trait loci (QTLs), identify runs of homozygosity and selective-sweep signals, and prioritize candidate genes for follow-up functional studies. We retrieved whole-genome sequencing data for Nelore breed (n=14) and Gir breed (n=20) from NCBI using the SRA toolkit. Reads were checked with FastQC, filtered with fastp to remove low-quality bases and adaptors, and retained high-quality reads based on Q20 and Q30. The reads were mapped to the Bos taurus reference (ARS-UCD2.0) with BWA-MEM; alignments were processed with SAMtools for sorting, duplicate marking, and MAPQ [&ge;] 20 filtering. Variants (insertions, deletions, SNVs) were called with GATK HaplotypeCaller, hard-filtered, normalized with bcftools, and annotated with SnpEff and SnpSift. Common variants were identified via in-house Python scripts; immune loci were detected from InnateDB and keyword searches; QTL overlaps were identified using Animal QTLdb; DAVID was used for GO and KEGG enrichment (P < 0.05). ROH islands were defined in PLINK as regions shared by >50% of individuals or samples, and selective sweeps were detected with RAiSD; genes overlapping ROH islands and RAiSD peaks were prioritized as candidate selection signatures. GATK identified 1,884,058 indels and 13,997,533 SNVs in Nelore breed, and 1,457,337 indels and 11,627,881 SNVs in Gir breed, with Ti/Tv ratios of ~2.26 and ~2.25, respectively. Nelore breed has more number of variants than Gir. We observed frameshift insertions in TLR3 and LOC508441 (CD33) in both the breeds and frameshift deletions in JAM3 in Nelore breed and PAX5 in Gir breed. The variants are also identified in the regulatory regions of both breeds. The high-impact SNVs were in CD46 and IL26 genes in Nelore breed, and PLG gene in Gir breed. Genome-wide scans using RAiSD identified selective sweeps in 707 candidate genes in Nelore breed and 165 in Gir breed. Comparing the ROH and RAiSD results, we prioritized the genes ANKRD11, MAGI2, LOC132345096, FOXP2, TCF12, and ATP5PO in Nelore breed, and the genes MEFV and ORIF1 in Gir breed. These genes are found in QTLs linked to milk and health traits. Functional enrichment showed that the genes exhibiting all the three variants belong to immune pathways such as, NF-kappaB signaling, T-cell receptor signaling, and MAPK signaling in both breeds. These results reveal breed-specific genomic variation locating immune loci and its associated QTLs and provide a list of candidate genes and regions for experimental validation and marker development to improve disease resistance and productivity in Indicine cattle.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Increased cellular plasticity within the neoplastic compartment of tumors correlates with disease aggressiveness, often culminating in greater resistance to cytotoxic therapies or augmented metastatic potential. Here we report that subpopulations of dedifferentiated neoplastic breast epithelial cells express canonical leukocyte cell surface receptor proteins and have thus named this cellular program immune mimicry. We document neoplastic cells engaging in immune mimicry within public human breast tumor single-cell RNA-seq datasets, histopathological breast tumor specimens, breast cancer cell lines, as well as in murine transgenic and cell line-derived mammary cancer models. Immune-mimicked neoplastic cells harbor hallmarks of dedifferentiation and are enriched in treatment-resistant and high-grade breast tumors. We corroborated these observations in aggressive breast cancer cell lines where anti-proliferative cytotoxic chemotherapies drove epithelial cells toward immune mimicry. Moreover, in subsequent proof-of-concept studies, we demonstrate that expression of the CD69 leukocyte activation protein by neoplastic cells confers a proliferative advantage that facilitates early tumor growth and therefore conclude that neoplastic breast epithelial cells upregulating leukocyte surface receptors potentiate malignancy. Moving forward, neoplastic immune mimicry should be evaluated for prognostic utility in additional breast cancer cohorts to determine its potential for patient stratification. Future research should evaluate correlates with distal metastases, progression-free survival, overall survival, and therapeutic response/resistance.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

In rats, cortical motor control first appears around postnatal day (P) 25, prior to which movements are generated by subcortical motor nuclei such as the red nucleus (RN). While these subcortical movements are thought to provide the activity that guides the development of M1, the types of movements that drive M1 activity and their somatotopic and temporal precision remain unknown. Here, we recorded activity in the forelimb region of M1 of P12-24 rats as they cycled between sleep and wake, and compared M1 and RN activity in P24 rats. At every age, M1 neurons showed somatopically precise activity to REM sleep twitches, along with strong responses to wake movements. From P12 to P24, the proportion of neurons that showed twitch-related activity decreased, twitch-related activity became more temporally refined, and a larger fraction of spikes occurred before movement onset. At P24, M1 showed less premovement activity than RN. Further, in contrast to the non-selective activity seen in M1, some RN neurons showed selective movement-related activity during wake, firing only during particular wake movements. These findings reveal that movement-related activity in M1 is somatotopically precise by P12 and temporally precise by P24. But M1 still lacks the strong premovement activity and selectivity characteristic of RN, suggesting that at P24, subcortical outputs remain the main drivers of M1's movement-related activity.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

This timeframe extends beyond the scope of traditional experimental or longitudinal studies commonly used to investigate microbiome dynamics. Despite their vast potential, historical samples available in museums and herbaria worldwide remains underutilized for studying host-microbiome interactions across broad temporal and spatial scales. It is due to incompatibilities with standard analytical pipelines and limited understanding of optimal classification parameters. While host DNA removal has traditionally been considered essential for accurate taxonomic assignment of metagenomic reads, this step is impractical for many historical samples because host reference genomes are unavailable for their species. Here, we show that host DNA content does not significantly affect microbial ecological analyses based on contemporary and historical samples. Additionally, DNA molecules from historical samples are highly fragmented and uneven in length. Conventional analysis workflows may be inefficient in this situation. To address this, we carried out detailed analyses on the impact of k-mer size on the accuracy of metagenomic assignments in historical samples. We propose a simple two-step approach in which reads are classified using two annotation databases constructed with k=24 and k=31. Through a simulation study, we demonstrated that this approach outperforms conventional workflows in effectively recovering microbial signals from a wide range of read lengths, including fragments as short as 24 bp (21 bp if k=21 is used).

Synthesized in the liver and intestine and excreted in the blood, ApoA-I undergoes complex, cooperative, and dynamic self-assembly with membrane lipids, producing unlipidated (or weakly lipidated), nascent discoidal, and mature HDL states. In vitro studies demonstrate that the reconstitution of purified protein and lipids restores this cooperative self-assembly. However, the kinetic pathways by which these mesoscopic, proteolipidic assemblies form remain incompletely understood. Here, we monitor the dynamics of ApoA-I-membrane interactions through real-time monitoring of morphological changes, which ensue when ApoA-I is incubated with minimal giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) composed of single phospholipids or phase-separating phospholipid-cholesterol mixtures. Our fluorescence microscopy measurements reveal that the interaction initiates a gross, morphological remodeling of the parent vesicle proceeding through discrete stages involving membrane poration, solute leakage, vesiculation, and lipid-lipid phase separation. Our atomic force microscopy measurements confirm that the outcome includes discoidal nanoparticles. This qualitative phenomenology is robust and fully reproducible for different protein mutants and alleles (WT APOA-1, {Delta}49ApoA-I, ApoE-3, and ApoE-4) and other lipid mixtures (including mixtures containing phosphoserine lipids).

Consequently, clinicians usually prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics, promoting the selection of multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, we investigate the application of machine learning techniques to detect ampicillin susceptibility directly from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This technique could enable an earlier optimised treatment in infections with ampicillin-susceptible E. faecium. Methods Two datasets of clinical E. faecium MALDI-TOF spectra and their resistance phenotype were analysed: our own Technical University of Munich (TUM) dataset and the publicly available MS-UMG dataset. We tested logistic regression (LR) and LightGBM models on each dataset via nested cross-validation and explored transferability on the respective other dataset. Results LightGBM demonstrated slightly better performance than LR in identifying susceptible isolates in the TUM dataset (area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) 0.907 +- 0.016 vs 0.902 +- 0.030) as well as in the MS-UMG dataset (AUPRC 0.902 +- 0.029 vs 0.899 +- 0.054).

J.; Tejero, J.", "abstract": "Cytoglobin and Neuroglobin are heme-containing proteins expressed in most vertebrates, including mammals, with still not completely defined physiological roles. Most of the putative functions of cytoglobin/neuroglobin, such as oxygen binding or nitric oxide dioxygenation, rely on the heme iron being in the ferrous (Fe2+) oxidation state. Therefore, it is very possible that reducing systems are active in the cell to maintain both proteins in the ferrous state. We have previously shown that the cytochrome b5 reductase isoform 3/ cytochrome b5 system, the canonical reductase of hemoglobin and myoglobin, can reduce cytoglobin at very fast rates, consistent with a possible physiological role. However this reducing system is unable to reduce neuroglobin, which to date lacks a validated, physiologically feasible reducing system. Here we have studied the interaction of cytochrome b5 reductase isoform 4 with cytoglobin and neuroglobin and found that cytochrome b5 reductase 4 can reduce cytoglobin at rates comparable to those observed with cytochrome b5 reductase 3/ cytochrome b5. Remarkably, it can also reduce neuroglobin efficiently. Studying different surface mutations of cytoglobin and neuroglobin we note that some cytoglobin mutations, in particular R84E and K116E decrease reduction rates by more than 10-fold, whereas surface mutations in neuroglobin that were shown to impair the interaction of neuroglobin with cytochrome c (E60K/D73K/E87K) show little effect on the reduction rates. We conclude that cytochrome b5 reductase 4 can supplement cytochrome b5 reductase 3/ cytochrome b5 roles for cytoglobin reduction in vivo and is a strong candidate for a physiological role as neuroglobin reductase.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Accurate identification of IAV subtypes is essential for effective epidemic surveillance and precise disease control. Here, we present Influ-BERT, a domain-adaptive pretrained model based on the Transformer architecture. Optimized from DNABERT-2, Influ-BERT was developed using a dedicat-ed corpus of approximately 900,000 influenza genome sequences. We constructed a custom Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer, and employed a two-stage training strategy involving domain-adaptive pretraining followed by task-specific fine-tuning. This approach significantly enhanced identification performance for IAV subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that Influ-BERT outperforms both traditional machine learning approaches and general genomic language models, such as DNABERT-2 and MegaDNA, in the task of IAV subtype identification. The model achieved F1-scores consistently above 97% and exhibited stable performance gains for subtypes that are underrepresented in sequencing data, including H5N8, H5N1, H7N9, and H9N2. Beyond subtype identification, Influ-BERT was successfully applied to additional tasks including respiratory virus identification, IAV pathogenicity prediction, and identification of IAV ge-nomic fragments and functional genes, demonstrating robust performance throughout. Further interpretability analysis using sliding window perturbation confirmed that the model focuses on biologically significant genomic regions, provid-ing insight into its improved predictive capability.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Extending our analyses to a set of haplotype-resolved great-ape genomes, we characterize the structure of an independent inversion in chimpanzees which extends an additional 650kb, encompasses 5 additional genes, and is ~2 million years younger than the human inversion. We further determine that gorillas exhibit an independent duplication of the KANSL1 gene which may predispose them to Koolen-de Vries syndrome causing microdeletions. Using short read sequencing data we characterize 17q21.31 haplotype diversity worldwide in ~5174 individuals from 107 populations finding increased frequencies of KANSL1 duplication-containing haplotypes in both European and South Asian populations as well as 8 double recombination events between inverted and non-inverted haplotypes ranging in size from 20-180kb. Finally, using 626 ancient Eurasian human genomes we show the frequency of haplotypes containing KANSL1 duplications has increased ~6-fold over the past 12 thousand years in Europe.

Drug efficacy is often attributed to drug response, commonly measured as the concentration of a drug required to inhibit a biological activity.

Machine learning-based drug response prediction has the potential to accelerate biomarker discovery and facilitate the development of more effective therapeutics. In this study, we present PathPCNet, a novel interpretable deep learning framework that integrates multi-omics data (copy number variation, mutation, and RNA sequencing) fused with biological pathways, drug molecular structure, and Principal Component Analysis for drug response prediction. Our model achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.941 and an R-squared of 0.885, outperforming the existing pathway-based approaches. We employ SHAP-based model interpretation to quantify the contributions of omics and drug features, uncovering key pathways and gene-drug interactions associated with resistance mechanisms. These results demonstrate the utility of integrative deep learning models not only for accurate prediction but also for generating biologically meaningful insights, which can advance drug discovery and precision oncology.

To validate our framework, we conducted a proof-of-concept study. We first generated synthetic biodiversity data for marine invertebrates using INDITEK-2.0 with known parameter values. To mimic field data, some realistic random Gaussian errors were added to the data. We then used our Bayesian inverse modelling framework to recover these original parameter values from the dataset of current biodiversity distributions after 500 million years of diversification. Our solution is a probability distribution on the parameter space, and we show that the method successfully recovered the target parameters values with a relatively low degree of uncertainity.

The role of this modification in epigenetics and gene regulation is relatively well understood, but our understanding of the extent and the role of lysine methylation of non-histone substrates remains fairly limited. Several lysine methyltransferases which methylate non-histone substrates are overexpressed in a number of cancers and are believed to be key drivers of cancer progression. There is great incentive to identify the lysine methylome, as this is a key step in identifying drug targets. While numerous computational models have been developed in the last decade to identify novel lysine methylation sites, the accuracy of these model has been modest, leaving much room for improvement. In this work, we leverage the most recent advancements in deep learning and present a transformer-based model for lysine methylation site prediction which achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. In addition, we show that other post-translational modifications of lysine are informative and that multitask learning is an effective way to integrate this prior knowledge into our lysine methylation site predictor, MethylSight 2.0.

Here we developed AiPP, a multimodal AI platform that predicts and characterizes ligand interaction sites directly from protein sequence. AiPP is powered by the evolutionary-scale protein large language models (LLMs) and leverages two harmonized ML training sets derived from the new databases comprising cysteine ligandability from activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) studies and reversible binding evidenced from co-crystal structures. We developed a LLM representation based clustering framework to interrogate, reconcile, and augment experimental labels in both databases. Two complementary protocols were implemented to iteratively expand the training data while improving model performance. Although trained exclusively on ABPP data, AiPP recovers 80% (Top-1) of cysteine liganding events from co-crystal structures, with 84% AUPRC and 89% AUROC. AiPP recapitulates consistently and heterogeneously liganded cysteines across cancer cell lines and reliably identifies dynamic, ligandable pockets in traditionally undruggable transcription factors. Remarkably, AiPP accurately predicts active-site and allosteric cysteines in protein tyrosine phosphatases that were undetected by ABPP. Finally, we applied AiPP to the entire human proteome, identifying ligandable sites in proteins that were undetected or unliganded by ABPP, including an allosteric site in MC3R, a new target for treatment of eating disorder and obesity. This proteomewide covalent ligandability atlas (version 1.0) is anticipated to guide future development of chemical probes and pharmaceutical modulators, particularly for understudied proteins and currently undruggable targets.

Organisms are particularly susceptible to the deleterious effects of stress during critical periods, when neuroplasticity is heightened, and initial representations of the sensory environment are mapped to cortex. When ELS is induced during the auditory cortical (ACx) critical period, it impairs both neural and behavioral responses to a variety of auditory stimuli that rely on temporal processing. Mechanisms by which ELS may alter critical period plasticity are of particular interest in understanding ELS-related pathology, including the 5-HT3R interneuron system, which has been implicated in regulating neural activity during critical periods. Here we examined two principal subpopulations of interneurons in primary ACx: VIP and NDNF cells, which account for a majority of cortical neurons expressing 5-HT3R. The expression of the Htr3a gene during normal development and under ELS conditions was quantified using multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization. We show that densities of cells expressing NDNF and VIP decrease following ear opening and across the ACx critical period, and that ELS results in the maintenance of elevated cell densities compared to age-matched controls. Further, Htr3a in VIP neurons is developmentally upregulated, and its expression is further increased by ELS beyond normal physiologic levels. Stress-induced shifts in these serotonergic interneurons may contribute to deficits that arise in auditory cortical and perceptual responses via effects on local cortical circuitry.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

While the origins of these conformational variations remain unclear, increasing evidence points to membranes as key modulators of fibrils conformations. In this study, we investigated how age-related alterations in membrane composition and fluidity influence -syn fibril formation and cellular outcomes. Using complex mixture membranes that mimic normal neuronal membranes and their age-related modifications in fatty acid chains, we found that -syn fibrils grown with these membranes displayed distinct 2D ssNMR spectral patterns compared to lipid-free -syn fibrils, reflecting differences in rigid fibril cores. Moreover, fibrils grown with aging-related membranes exhibited weaker membrane association than those grown with normal neuronal membranes. These membrane-associated fibrils induce stronger neuronal pathologies than lipid-free fibrils, though the severity differed in intraneuronal aggregation and inflammation responses.

From a prior machine-learning-guided screen of 875 candidate AMPs, 62 exhibited activity against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) and low in vitro hemolytic and cytotoxic activity.

In animal experiments, AMPs were administered via in ovo injection on day 18 of embryonic development. In APEC challenge trials, yolk sacs were inoculated with APEC post-hatch to assess early chick mortality, while in pen trials, birds were raised in a commercial production setting for 35 days. For challenged birds, TeBi1 (10 g/egg) significantly reduced bacterial detection in the air sac and pericardium, increased body weight by 50% and reduced cytokine transcript levels by 10-30% on day 7 post hatch. In HD11 chicken macrophage-like cultured cells, TeRu4 (16 g/mL) suppressed LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine transcript levels.

Historically, concerns around adolescent marijuana use focused on the development of psychosis later in life, however recent findings indicate that cognitive domains may also be at risk. CB1R was shown to interfere with neuronal network oscillations and to impair sensory gating and memory function. Neuronal oscillations are essential in multiple cognitive functions and their impairment was documented in neurological and psychiatric diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate how adolescent pre-treatment with the CB1R selective agonist CP-55940 may lead to abnormalities in theta synchronization in adulthood. Rats were pre-treated with CP-55940 (n=11, 6 males, 5 females) or vehicle (n=8, 4 males, 4 females) during adolescence (daily i/p injections between PND 32-36 or PND 42-46, n=10 and 9, respectively). They were then tested in adulthood (PND 70-88, n=17 or PND 111-115, n=2) under urethane anesthesia. Hippocampal theta rhythm was elicited by brainstem stimulation at 5 intensity levels one hour before and up to 5 hours after injection. We found a lasting significant decrease in theta power after CP-55940 in adult rats which was aggravated further in rats pre-treated in adolescence with the CB1R agonist. The effect was significantly larger (p=0.0462) in rats pre-treated during early adolescence (PND 32-36) compared to the group pre-treated during late adolescence (PND 42-46). We conclude that 1.

To derive meaning from written words, visual input is first processed in unimodal (i.e., sensory-specific) visual streams and then engages a distributed language network (LANG) that includes classic perisylvian language areas and supports transmodal (i.e., sensory-nonspecific) functions. A reading-relevant region in the inferotemporal cortex (ITC), sometimes called the visual word form area (VWFA), has been the subject of controversy because it displays properties of both systems: it responds to meaningless written pseudowords, implying a unimodal visual function, but also responds to meaningful speech, implying a transmodal function. We investigated whether precision functional mapping could help clarify this regions role in reading. We characterized a stream of visual regions along the ITC that responded preferentially to visual orthographic forms (i.e., written pseudowords, consonant strings, and real words). Network mapping revealed that only the most anterior region of this \"orthographic stream\" was connected to the LANG network and accordingly showed responses to meaningful speech. Furthermore, this anterior region was more selective, responding preferentially to text-based stimuli, whereas the more posterior regions of the stream were additionally activated by perceptually similar images (i.e., number strings, foreign script). Our results support that connections to the LANG network may drive specialization along the orthographic stream for writing.

To investigate how these two factors contribute to the composition of typical scene drawings, we analyzed 1,192 drawings of six indoor scene categories, obtained from 303 participants. For each object featured in the drawings, we estimated its visual occurrence frequency from the ADE20K dataset of annotated scene images, and its semantic relatedness to the scene concept from a word2vec language processing model. Across all scenes of a given category, generalized linear models revealed that visual and conceptual factors both predicted the likelihood of an object featuring in the scene drawings, with a combined model outperforming both single-factor models. We further computed the visual and semantic specificity of objects for a given scene, that is, how diagnostic an object is for the scene. Object specificity offered only weak predictive power when predicting the selection of objects, yet even infrequently drawn objects remained diagnostic of their scenes.

Administration of this mRNA mixture transforms somatic cells into designer antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in vivo, that simultaneously express the antigen, a co-stimulatory molecule, and a cytokine. These designer APCs activated tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells more effectively than mRNA encoding the antigen alone and elicited robust anti-tumor immune responses.

The resulting data were used to characterize and compare the species composition, multi-locus sequence types (STs), and resistance-associated mutations present within each sample type. Single-isolate sequencing showed that each patient was infected with a single P. aeruginosa strain that accumulated mutations and became increasingly antibiotic-resistant over time. Mutations in genes associated with {beta}-lactam resistance, including ampC, ftsI, and oprD, arose over time and corresponded with changes in antimicrobial susceptibility in single isolates. Species profiling of culture-enriched metagenomic populations revealed that all samples contained P. aeruginosa, but several also contained additional Gram-negative pathogens. Metagenomic analysis of culture-enriched populations identified resistance-associated mutations at variable frequencies, many of which were not identified in single isolates from the same sample. In some cases, resistance-associated mutations initially detected at low frequency rose to fixation after antimicrobial treatment. Overall, this study shows that population-based metagenomic sequencing effectively captures within-patient genomic diversity of P. aeruginosa during antimicrobial therapy, and could aid in the detection and interpretation of resistance-associated mutations in this pathogen.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

The nuclear receptor NR4A1 emerged as a key regulator within the inflammatory response of several immune diseases by regulating immune cell activation. In this study, we investigated the role of NR4A1 in the activation and recruitment of brain resident and peripheral immune cells after cerebral ischemia. Here, we show that NR4A1 mediates an anti-inflammatory and damage-limiting effect after stroke. This effect is largely mediated by neutrophil recruitment and importantly, NR4A1 activation with its ligand Cytosporone B improves functional outcome and reduces brain damage. Modulation of NR4A1 is therefore a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of the nuclear receptor NR4A1 in the activation and recruitment of peripheral and brain resident immune cells after cerebral ischemia and its consequences for stroke outcome. We demonstrate that NR4A1 ablation augments neutrophil activation and CNS recruitment within days after stroke thereby increasing infarct size, CNS inflammation, neuronal damage and deteriorating functional outcome. This effect is mediated via modulation of cell-intrinsic neutrophil function and maturation as illustrated by neutrophil-specific NR4A1 ablation and mixed bone-marrow chimera experiments. Notably, the NR4A1 agonist Cytosporone B reduced CNS neutrophil infiltration, infarct size and functional outcome after stroke in a bicentric preclinical stroke trial, demonstrating that NR4A1-mediated control of neutrophil reactivity is amenable to pharmacological modulation. In humans, NR4A1 expressing neutrophils are present in the peripheral blood of stroke patients and neutrophil NR4A1 expression correlates with improved long-term outcome after 3 months. Furthermore, NR4A1 expression in brain parenchyma neutrophils is negatively correlated with neuronal cell loss, illustrating a role of NR4A1 in regulating neutrophil mediated neuronal cell death in human stroke. Together our data reveal the nuclear factor NR4A1 as a brake of intrinsic neutrophil activity controlling neutrophil-mediated brain inflammation and neurotoxicity in stroke which may serve as a novel therapeutic target to limit inflammation-associated augmentation of ischemic damage after stroke.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

This fundamental question has major implications for neuroscience and medicine, as stimulation outcomes remain highly variable even when identical parameters (\"how\") and target sites (\"where\") are used. Such unpredictability undermines reproducibility, limits clinical reliability, and forces current protocols to rely on empirical trial-and-error rather than principled, evidence-based strategies. Mounting evidence suggests that the brain's state prior to stimulation--a crucial \"when\" factor--shapes responses, yet the most reliable predictive markers remain unknown. Here, we systematically characterize the links between pre-stimulus (spontaneous) activity and post-stimulus (evoked) responses using simultaneous high-density EEG and stereotactic EEG from 36 epilepsy patients across ~320 sessions (>10,000 individual stimulations). We show that large-scale neural dynamics robustly predict stimulation outcomes, with a subset of measures--particularly network synchronization, functional connectivity, and spatiotemporal signal diversity--consistently forecasting responses across sessions. Whole-brain activity enhanced prediction compared to local assessments, and predictability varied across networks, being strongest in sensorimotor and visual regions. These findings establish a quantitative framework for state-dependent brain stimulation: by timing interventions to optimal pre-stimulus states, variability can be reduced and reproducibility enhanced. Our results directly address the fundamental question of where and when to stimulate, providing a pathway toward evidence-based protocols with improved therapeutic precision.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

As the wall is extended due to turgor pressure, the wall mechanical response, specifically the walls elastic properties, are not well understood. In this study, we introduce a new surface morphology-based method to measure the elasticity of the cell wall in tip-growing cells. Previous work is based on the wall meridional outline on the assumption the cell is axisymmetric, an idea that does not align well with the reality of the cells. Instead, we developed a way to triangulate the surface of the cell using marker point locations that could be achieved experimentally with fluorescent labeling. After measuring the elastic stretch and curvatures from our triangulation, a mechanical model is used to measure the tensions and surface bulk modulus distribution. We simulated moss tip cells from experimental Physcomitrium patens plants to challenge the method with noise estimated from experiments. We discovered that increasing the discretization of the triangulation improved robustness against noise. With multiple cell sampling, we found that around 10 cells were sufficient to recover the elasticity distribution with noise, but only when the elastic stretches were high enough at the tip. With low elastic stretch at the tip, the appearance of non-physical modulus values led to underestimated inference values there, causing false-positive gradient results. This compelled us to study a range of cases, leading us to a dimensionless global phase map showing areas of good inference. This technique will open the field to more comprehensive measurements of tip cell elasticity, providing a key step in understanding tip cell growth and morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Using MicFLY, we can identify all major intestinal taxa, discriminate live from dead bacteria, perform single cell measurements of heterogeneous bacterial mRNA expression and concurrently quantify Immunoglobulin (Ig) A and G binding to intestinal bacteria.

Here, we show that Xenopus wdr5 is expressed in blastula stem cells and enriched in neural crest cells during neurulation. Morpholino mediated depletion of wdr5 abolished neural crest marker expression both in embryos and in reprogrammed explants while unexpectedly expanding neural plate border and neural plate domains. Gain of function experiments revealed a striking dose-dependent effect: low levels of wdr5 enhanced neural crest formation, whereas high levels suppressed it, suggesting a requirement for precise stoichiometry with interacting partners. We identify myc as a critical cofactor for wdr5 in neural crest specification. wdr5 and myc physically interact in early embryos, and coexpression at defined ratios rescues neural crest formation while either, individually, is inhibitory. Domain specific mutagenesis showed that the WBM site of wdr5 is required for myc-dependent activation of neural crest genes, while the WIN site regulates myc expression itself; both domains are necessary to rescue wdr5 loss of function phenotypes. Moreover, modulation of myc levels phenocopied wdr5s dose-sensitive effects, reinforcing the importance of balanced wdr5/myc activity. These findings reveal that wdr5 orchestrates neural crest development through multiple, domain-specific mechanisms, integrating stoichiometric control with partner-specific transcriptional regulation and highlighting parallels with Wdr5/Myc cooperation in cancer, underscoring the broader relevance of precise cofactor ratios in cell fate decisions.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Plasticity can be a valuable tool in the arsenal of an animal trying to maintain physiological function under rapidly changing conditions and can be an important contributor to thermal tolerance. In this work, we characterized the transcriptomic response to elevated developmental temperature, and subsequent acute exposure to two higher temperatures using the widespread and ecologically important copepod, Acartia tonsa. Using a split brood experimental design, we found that copepods that developed at 22C had higher upper lethal temperatures compared to those reared at 18C, demonstrating developmental plasticity in thermal tolerance. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that developmental temperature strongly influenced gene expression both at baseline and in response to acute thermal stress. Exposure to a moderate heat challenge (28C) elicited divergent transcriptional responses between developmental treatments, suggesting developmental preconditioning, whereas exposure to extreme heat (33C) triggered a more conserved stress response across groups. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified gene modules associated with upper lethal temperature, highlighting stress response, cellular regulation, and metabolic pathways as key contributors to thermal tolerance.

Yet it remains a major bottleneck, as the current gold standard relies on manual counting by multiple blinded observers. This process is slow, labor intensive, and prone to variability. While some software can measure total neurite length, they aren't made to specifically measure new growth in complicated images from real-life injury models, like the thoracic crush and pyramidotomy model. Existing software can measure total neurite length in culture, but it is not designed to capture new growth in complex images from injury models, such as thoracic crush or pyramidotomy. Crucially, these tools lack the ability to selectively analyze growth within user-defined regions, a key requirement for injury paradigms. To address this need, we developed the Deep Neurite Analysis Tool (DeNAT), an accessible deep-learning based platform that automatically measures neurite outgrowth after injury. DeNAT allows users to define regions of interest to specifically quantify sprouting in images from common spinal cord injury paradigms. We benchmarked its performance against manual scoring and conventional automated approaches. DeNAT achieved 87 percent accuracy in detecting neurite sprouts relative to manual counts, while reducing variability and labor.

Methods: We investigated the direct and early effects of IH on BAT using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. Differentiated mouse brown adipocytes were exposed to IH for 48 hours and analyzed for {beta}3-adrenergic signaling, lipolysis, and thermogenic activation. Complementary in vivo studies assessed transcriptomic, morphological, and functional changes in BAT, white adipose tissue (WAT), and liver after 1 or 4 weeks of IH exposure in mice. Results: IH blunted {beta}3-adrenergic signaling in cultured brown adipocytes, leading to reduced phosphorylation of key signaling proteins, impaired lipolytic response, and decreased expression of UCP1. In vivo, BAT exhibited early and sustained transcriptomic rewiring characterized by downregulation of pathways related to fatty acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and peroxisomal function. These molecular changes were accompanied by abnormal lipid droplet enlargement and a reduced lipolytic response to adrenergic stimulation. In contrast, WAT showed transient gene expression changes, and the liver displayed a delayed and robust transcriptomic response evident only after four weeks of IH exposure. Despite these metabolic alterations, thermogenic responses to cold challenge remained intact in IH-treated mice. Conclusions: BAT is uniquely and rapidly affected by intermittent hypoxia, undergoing functional, molecular, and morphological changes within one week of exposure. These alterations precede systemic inflammation and metabolic dysfunction, positioning BAT dysfunction as an early event in the pathogenesis of OSA-associated metabolic disease.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

To address these issues, we developed a highly sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method capable of quantifying cannabinoids in 50 {micro}L of liquid whole blood, providing a practical microsampling alternative to dried blood approaches. Using liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with sodium hydroxide alkalinization and acetonitrile precipitation, followed by quantitative analysis on an Agilent 6495 liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole (LC-TQ) mass spectrometer, we achieved lower limits of quantitation (LLOQs) of 0.10 ng/mL for {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabinol (CBN), 0.20 ng/mL for cannabigerol (CBG), 0.30 ng/mL for cannabidiol (CBD), 0.50 ng/mL for 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC), and 5.0 ng/mL for 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH).

To our knowledge, this is the first validated approach for cannabinoid quantitation in less than 100 {micro}L of liquid whole blood with an LLOQ for THC comparable to that with the most sensitive LC-MS/MS methods using standard blood volumes. The achieved LLOQs for other cannabinoids are also suitable for forensic toxicology applications. We anticipate particular utility for obtaining evidence from suspected impaired drivers at the roadside when paired with finger-prick sampling and liquid blood microcollection tubes.

Their health and survival are threatened by diminishing floral resources, pesticide exposure, parasitic mites, and microbial and viral diseases. Among these stressors, viral infections are particularly challenging, often exacerbated by the parasitic mite, Varroa destructor, a competent vector of multiple honey bee viruses. Understanding the mechanisms underlying honey bee-virus interactions is critical for mitigating the negative impact of infections on colony health. One understudied aspect is the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in viral pathogenesis and antiviral defense. miRNAs are short, non-coding RNAs produced by both hosts and pathogens that act as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and can influence host-pathogen dynamics during infection. In this study, we used a honey bee-derived cell line to test the hypothesis that viral infection perturbs honey bee- and viral-encoded miRNA expression. Methods: Small RNA libraries from honey bee AmE-711 cells subjected to one of four treatments: media change only (uninfected), heat-killed Acute bee paralysis virus (ABPV), the viral mimic Poly(I:C), or infectious ABPV, were prepared using an Illumina Truseq kit. Sequencing data were analyzed using miRDeep2 and sRNAtoolbox to identify differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs, which were subsequently validated by RT-qPCR assay. Results: Sequencing yielded > 3.6 x 108 raw reads that were assigned to 12 small RNA libraries, from which, 481 unique miRNAs were identified. Moreover, 15 miRNAs were DE in ABPV-infected cells compared to uninfected cells: miR-2b-5p, miR-33-5p, miR-133-3p, miR-6001-3p, miR-996-3p, miR-965-3p, miR-125-5p, miR-13b-3p, miR-79-3p, miR-971-3p, miR-277-3p, miR-92c-5p, miR-6065-3p, miR-965-5p, and miR-3786-5p. We highlight some of the DE miRNAs identified in ABPV-infected cells that show regulatory effects in other systems in response to infection. Conclusion: This study identified miRNAs differentially expressed in ABPV-infected cells, suggesting roles in either antiviral defense or in promoting viral pathogenesis through suppression of host immune responses.

In this study, we examined the distribution of cardiac iNKT subsets and their response to TCR-directed alpha Galactosyl ceramide/cluster of differentiation 1d (GalCer/CD1d) complexes in a mouse model of Doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiotoxicity. In healthy mice, the heart harbored distinct iNKT subsets, dominated by pro-inflammatory iNKT1 cells, followed by iNKT2 subsets.

In Dox-induced cardiotoxicity, this treatment unexpectedly increased both IFN-{gamma}, a hallmark cytokine of iNKT1 cells, and IL-10, a key anti-inflammatory mediator typically associated with regulatory iNKT subsets.

Sustained production of IgE antibodies, even in the absence of allergen exposure in persistent allergy, suggests the existence of long-lived IgE PC. However, the ability of IgE PC to undergo terminal differentiation and become long-lived has been questioned. Here, we demonstrate that IgE PC undergoes swift maturation into non-dividing MHCIIlowCD93+CD98high PC in immunized mice. Mature IgE PC have a distinct transcriptional profile for adaptation to high protein synthesis, glycosylation, and survival. Using PC timestamping, long-lived IgE PC could be found several months after immunization in mice. Remarkably, the spleen rather than the bone marrow, was the main tissue of residence of mature long-lived IgE PC.

Receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a multifunctional regulator of cell fate with kinase and scaffolding functions, and we previously identified RIPKs as regulators of beta-cell cytotoxicity in vitro. Here we report that Ripk1 expression is increased in islets from aged non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice and beta-cells from T1D donors, suggesting that RIPK1 may drive cytokine- and autoimmune-mediated beta-cell demise in T1D. Using NIT-1 beta-cells derived from NOD mice, we observed that TNFa+IFNg increase RIPK1 phosphorylation, caspase 3/7 activity, and cell death. In contrast, this cytotoxicity was blocked with small molecule RIPK1 inhibition or in Ripk1 gene-edited (Ripk1-delta) beta-cells. Co-labeling of caspase 3/7 activation and cell death in single cells revealed protection from caspase-dependent and -independent forms of death in NIT-1 Ripk1-delta cells. RNAseq uncovered differential cell death-, immune-, and identity-related gene expression, and kinome profiling identified changes in MAPK, Eph, JAK, and other kinase activity associated with protection from cell death in RIPK1 deficient beta-cells. Furthermore, in vitro co-culture assays and in vivo adoptive transfer experiments revealed that NIT-1 Ripk1-delta cells were protected from autoimmune destruction by splenocytes isolated from diabetic NOD mice. Collectively, our findings indicate that RIPK1 promotes beta-cell demise in response to cytokine and autoimmune stress via actions on gene expression and kinase signaling.

On four survey dates in 2017, the number of accompanying brown boobies and their plunge-diving behavior were recorded visually from the upper deck using only handheld counters. Birds were more frequently observed following ferries traveling from the nesting-rich island of Hahajima toward Chichijima, with diving activity peaking midway along the route. These patterns suggest that the ferry may function as a fish finder, disturbing prey such as flying fish, which are then exploited by the birds. This report illustrates how natural history observations conducted without high-tech equipment or tracking devices, using only the platform of regular public transport, can yield new insights into seabird behavior. The findings also highlight the potential for expanding citizen science approaches in behavioral ecology. The manuscript is currently under peer review.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

In this study we show that presence of sequence divergence (polymorphism) between homologous chromosomes increases the local recombination rate in Arabidopsis thaliana. This effect is observed genome-wide, turning cold regions of the genome hot. This relocation of COs towards polymorphic regions occurs at the expense of non-polymorphic ones, which become colder. This global overhaul of the CO landscape is dependent on the mismatch repair (MMR) machinery. This suggests that MMR has a pro-CO role, driving COs to regions of the genome where it could detect sequence differences between homologous chromosomes.

In many insects, reproductive diapause shows clinal variation along environmental gradients such as photoperiod and temperature. How such continuous trait variation may be encoded at the molecular level and maintained in the presence of gene flow remains largely elusive. The fruit fly Drosophila triauraria, distributed across a wide latitudinal range of the Japanese archipelago. Northern strains exhibit a strong photoperiodic reproductive diapause in females, whereas southern strains fail to arrest ovarian development even under short-day conditions at low temperatures. These distinct phenotypes and the presumable clinal variation in between, provide an ideal opportunity to examine the molecular basis of latitudinal divergence. We first investigated diapause induction in both females and males from previously reported and newly tested strains collected from the regions spanning ~26-43{degrees}N. The assessment revealed continuous geographic variation in sensitivity to photoperiod and temperature. We then analyzed the whole-genome sequences of 21 strains, including 14 newly sequenced, to identify genomic regions underlying this divergence. In addition to the conventional FST analysis, we applied a \"monophyletic window\" approach suitable for limited sample sizes. The analysis identified a candidate region containing putative E-box and TER-box sequence motifs of the timeless (tim) gene, which has been previously implicated in diapause regulation in multiple insect species. The quantitative PCR analysis further supported a partial association between the tim expression and the incidence of female diapause.

We hypothesized that thymic B cells acquire survival mechanisms that bypass normal tolerance checkpoints, enabling persistence independent of antigen-specific selection. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, V(D)J repertoire analysis, and spatial transcriptomics from human thymic samples, representing the largest MG atlas to date (237,661 cells), we discovered a previously unrecognized tolerance checkpoint swap in MG pathogenesis. Pathological class-switched B cells within thymic germinal centers exhibited reduced antigen presentation capacity (decreased CD74, CD1C expression) and diminished CD40 co-stimulation while upregulating TNFRSF17 to engage BAFF survival signals. This shift from T cell-dependent activation to BAFF-driven survival allowed polyclonal autoreactive B cells to persist without stringent selection and seed peripheral sites. T follicular helper cells supported this reprogramming through increased TNFSF13B and CHGB expression, the latter enabling dopamine-mediated acceleration of B cell synapses. These findings resolve longstanding clinical paradoxes in MG and identify the BAFF-BCMA axis as an actionable therapeutic target. Measuring serum BAFF and soluble BCMA could provide superior biomarkers to antibody titers, while BAFF inhibition or CD40 agonism could restore normal tolerance checkpoints, offering new therapeutic strategies for MG and potentially other autoimmune diseases.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

We propose a hierarchical framework integrating oncogenes within cellular context by examining canonical EGFR mutations. We defined an EGFR mutation signature (mSig) by identifying differentially expressed genes in EGFR-mutant LUADs. Semi-supervised clustering and machine learning models were used to test performance and reproducibility across independent datasets. We analyzed molecular subtypes, lineage markers, co-occurring mutations, and candidate drug targets in EGFR mSig positive (+) versus negative (-) tumors. The EGFR mSig showed robust classification performance across datasets (AUROC = 0.83 - 0.95; mean NPV = 96.3%). Validated unsupervised gene expression subtypes and lung lineage markers were closely aligned with EGFR mSig status. mSig(+) tumors were identified, even in tumors without EGFR mutations. A subset of canonical RAS mutations mirrored the EGFR mutation pattern. EGFR-mutant/mSig(-) tumors were enriched for non-Bronchioid subtypes and had co-mutations in TP53 or RAS. Coordinated mutations were identified including RAS, KEAP1, STK11, TP53, and CDKN2A, supportive of prior reports. In sum, novel EGFR mSig that captures the transcriptional footprint of EGFR activation, revealed a subset of EGFR wildtype LUADs with \"mutant-like\" features.

Seaweeds such as Kappaphycus alvarezii synthesize diverse bioactive compounds, but their endogenous hormone pathways have been largely uncharacterized. Phytohormones, essential regulators of plant growth, reproduction, and stress responses, are central to the beneficial effects of these biostimulants. To uncover these mechanisms, we performed a genome-wide analysis of hormone biosynthesis and recognition pathways across thirteen algal species, focusing on nine classes of phytohormones. By integrating KEGG annotation, structural modeling, and eggNOG-based orthology, we assessed the completeness and conservation of hormone-associated pathways. Our results revealed consistent retention of key biosynthetic entry points, including IAM-related enzymes for auxin, TRIT1/CYP735A for cytokinins, GA oxidases for gibberellins, and pchA for salicylic acid, alongside divergent or absent canonical upstream enzymes. In parallel, partial but conserved signaling modules were identified for abscisic acid, ethylene, and other classes. This mosaic pattern, fragmented biosynthesis coupled with selectively retained signaling, suggests that algae employ noncanonical enzymatic routes or microbial complementation to sustain hormone activity. Expression profiling in K. alvarezii further revealed light-responsive regulation of auxin, cytokinin, GA, and ABA genes, highlighting their role in environmental adaptation. Together, these findings provide new genomic insights into algal hormone biology, establish the first structural and functional evidence for GA metabolism in red algae, and identify candidate phytohormones likely to contribute to the biostimulant activity of K. alvarezii extracts.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

However, identifying protein-coding genes in newly assembled genomes remains complex, time-consuming, and labour-intensive. As a result, many eukaryotic genome sequences in public databases lack comprehensive gene annotations, limiting their use in ortholog identification and restricting their value for evolutionary and functional genomics. Here, we present fDOG-Assembly, a novel tool for targeted, feature architecture-aware ortholog searches directly in unannotated genome assemblies. Our benchmarks show that fDOG-Assembly performs similarly to BUSCO in genome mode in the identification of orthologs, while offering the added advantage of not being limited to universal or single-copy genes. When applied to identify orthologs for 5,000 human genes in Nematostella vectensis and Rattus norvegicus, fDOG-Assembly approaches the performance of traditional ortholog search tools that rely on pre-annotated proteomes. Importantly, it can also uncover orthologs that escape detection by conventional methods due to incomplete gene annotations, helping to fill gaps in phylogenetic profiles. As a case study, we screened 176 soil invertebrate genome assemblies for genes involved in antibacterial compound production. Notably, we found that orthologs of genes involved in beta-lactam biosynthesis are widespread in springtails. With one exception, individual springtail species contain the full gene repertoire for cephamycin synthesis, suggesting they are significant natural producers of beta-lactams.

These characteristics play an important role in terms of the functional robustness of proteins against mutations, and are pivotal for the study of protein function and evolution. Proteins exhibiting internal symmetry often demonstrate enhanced functional benefits, such as increased binding affinity due to repeated structural motifs, and evolutionary advantages that may result from gene duplication or fusion events, leading to more robust and adaptable molecular architectures. Similarly, circular permutations have been linked to improved catalytic activity and enhanced thermostability, opening new avenues in the design of enzymes and other functional proteins. In this study, we introduce a novel computational pipeline that leverages secondary structure elements (SSEs) as a compressed yet informative representation of protein structure to detect both symmetry and structural rearrangements effectively. Our method shows strong advantages against the Combinatorial Extension with Circular Permutations (CECP) for computational cost and identifies 17,130 circularly related proteins. Additionally, it detects 26,739 proteins associated with indel mutations. Notably, 8,855 of these exhibit both circular permutation and indel mutations- highlighting a potential co-evolutionary relationship between these two types of structural variation.

Hence, de novo assemblies can benefit from misassembly detection and correction, to produce a more optimal assembly. Results: We present Stash, a novel hash-based data structure designed for storing and querying large sequencing data.

Through integrative genomic, proteomic, and functional analyses, we demonstrate that SYCP1 is aberrantly re-expressed in tumor cells, where it actively promotes DNA damage repair, cell cycle progression, and malignant growth. SYCP1 binds chromatin at regulatory elements and directly controls transcriptional programs governing genome maintenance, including key effectors such as CCNB1, PCNA, RAD51C, and H2AX. Loss of SYCP1 impairs DNA repair kinetics, attenuates tumor cell proliferation and migration, and increases sensitivity to chemotherapeutics cisplatin and gemcitabine. Mechanistically, SYCP1 interfaces with chromatin remodeling complexes and transcription factors SP1 and SP2, modulating their genomic occupancy and facilitating oncogenic transcriptional outputs. Clinically, high SYCP1 expression stratifies patients with poor prognosis and therapy resistance across multiple cancer types.

For instance, environmental justice studies have shown that green space acreage and quality are typically lower in low-income neighbourhoods. However, more detailed assessments integrating a range of ecosystem services and the diverse needs of multiple groups are needed to effectively inform equitable urban planning.

These findings highlight the importance of integrating social needs and vulnerabilities into urban greening strategies. Policies that move beyond generic measures of green space provision and explicitly consider multiple ES can help ensure that urban green infrastructure delivers fair and effective benefits across diverse communities.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

M.; Bhattacharyya, S.; Moser Tralamazza, S.; Croll, D.", "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications influence the expression of phenotypic traits by modulating gene expression and responses to environmental cues. In plant pathogens, the expression of virulence-associated genes such as effectors and gene clusters encoding the production of secondary metabolites are known to be regulated by epigenetic modifications. Modulating epigenetic patterns of such genes is considered a key adaptation for pathogens to successfully attack hosts. Gene expression variation within pathogen species are regulated by extensive cis-regulatory polymorphism and insertion activities of transposable elements. However, whether pathogens vary in epigenetic profiles among members of the same species remains largely unexplored. Here, we focus on the major fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and establish histone methylation profiles for 45 isolates of an extensively characterized wheat field population. We analyzed the facultative heterochromatin mark H3K27me3, a histone methylation that is thought to regulate effector and gene cluster loci in the genome. H3K27m3 coverage was increased in transposable element rich regions, with newly inserted long-terminal repeat retrotransposons contributing to epigenetic variation among pathogen genotypes. Overall, nearly 20% of all genes showed within-population variation in H3K27me3 marks, which likely contributes to the substantial within-population variation in gene expression. Effector candidate genes and members of gene clusters showed higher than average variation in repressive histone marks among isolates. Taken together, our study provides among the first insights into intra-species epigenetic variation of a fungal pathogen. Such population-level variation in histone methylation patterns opens avenues to recapitulate epigenetic mechanisms of pathogen adaptation.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

H.; Stegmayer, G.", "abstract": "The challenge of establishing the relationship between protein sequences and their function cannot yet be considered completely solved. State-of-the-art annotation of Pfam domains is based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) built from hand-crafted sequence alignments. However, while this approach has been highly successful during the last decades since its proposal, there is yet a very large number of proteins that remain unannotated because there is no possible alignment to already known and functionally characterized sequences, or HMM fails to discriminate between similar domains. Adding structural information using deep and graph neural networks (GNNs) presents an opportunity to build upon existing models in those more challenging cases. GNNs excel at capturing complex relationships in data and can learn a model that shares information across all existing families, thus being able to generalize Pfam domain predictions to novel sequences. In this work we propose GNN2Pfam, an end-to-end GNN-based method for Pfam family domain annotation. Our strategy allows one single model to be trained for all species and families. This novel proposal uses the protein 3D structure together with a sequence representation obtained from a large pre-trained model. The GNN2Pfam model is based on a graph derived from amino acid interactions in the 3D structure, learning both sequential and structural features from this representation. Experiments show that the proposed GNN-based model can clearly outperform the HMM state-ofthe-art predictive performance in Pfam domains annotations.

Reconstruction of metastatic phylogenies in mouse models and patients suggests that LN and distant organ metastases are often seeded by independent clones, yet no genetic alterations have bene found to account for this divergent seeding. Here, we discover opposing roles for interferon signaling in metastasis to LNs and distant organs. We uncover that exposure to leukocyte-derived type I interferon promotes LN metastasis while impairing spread to distant organs by inducing interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Further, while LN metastases have previously been demonstrated to disrupt anti-tumor immunity, we find that ISG expression induced during LN metastasis sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). By mimicking the phenotype of LN metastases through delivery of type I interferon, ICB refractory primary tumors and distant metastases can be sensitized to ICB. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the immune system conditions tumors for LN metastasis through type I interferon secretion while impairing distant spread and that this axis can be exploited to render immunotherapy resistant tumors sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade therapy.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

PTH1-34 treatment totally reversed the deleterious effects of Ovx on trabecular bone microarchitecture, material properties and strength, while Sr had no significant beneficial effects. Co-treatment with Sr and PTH1-34 further increased trabecular thickness, bone material properties (higher force and working energy) and trabecular bone strength in comparison to PTH1-34 treatment alone. Whereas PTH1-34 treatment enhanced cortical bone volume and thickness, co-treatment with Sr and PTH1-34 further elevated cortical thickness and demonstrated a significant beneficial effect on cortical bone strength. Stimulations of osteoblast cultures with Sr, PTH1-34 or both agents increased Rankl expression and decreased that of Opg, which was consistent with elevated urinary deoxypyridinoline levels reflecting higher bone resorption in Ovx rats receiving the same treatments. Finally, Sr and PTH1-34 alone augmented Igf1 and Alpl expressions in osteoblast cultures, whereas co-stimulation with both agents further enhanced those gene expressions.

Physiological and transcriptomic profiling across source and sink tissues revealed that biomass partitioning to flowers shifted only under complete phosphate withdrawal. Analyses of key phosphate-responsive genes highlighted the involvement of lipid biosynthesis, glycolysis, and phosphate mobilization from organic pools. In contrast to source tissues, phospholipid biosynthesis remained active in sink organs. While the transcriptional response of key regulators, such as SPX DOMAIN GENE (SPX), PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 (PHR1) and NITRATE-INDUCIBLE, GARP-TYPE TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR1 (NIGT1) followed canonical patterns, high-affinity nitrate and phosphate transporters remained expressed at elevated Pi. Our data suggest a lack of suppression of phosphate uptake and root-to-shoot translocation at higher supply levels, with excess phosphate supply resulting in depletion of nitrate pools restricting further growth.

Yet, whether MR exerts an anti-tumor effect in the presence of an immune-competent background remains inconclusive. Accumulating evidence has shown an essential role of methionine in immune cell differentiation and function. Thus, competition for methionine between tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment may drive tumor growth and tumor response to therapy. Here, we aim to define the impact of MR on tumor growth and associated immunity. We first assessed the effect of MR in a series of immunocompetent mouse models of melanoma, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and lung. MR led to a broad tumor inhibition effect across these models and such tumor inhibition was not sex- or genetic background-dependent but appears to be fully or partially immune-dependent. Through flow cytometry analysis, we found a consistent increase in intratumoral activated CD8+ T cells across different tumor models and depletion of CD8+ T cells partially or completely reversed MR-induced tumor inhibition in a model dependent manner. Interestingly in young healthy non-tumor-bearing mice, MR increased spleen CD3+ and CD8+ T cell populations. Metabolomics and RNAseq analysis of spleen-derived CD8+ T cells revealed significant increase in purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism and that are in line with the metabolic feature of activated T cells. Furthermore, MR improved the efficacy of anti-PD1 immune checkpoint blockade. Together, MR primes T cell metabolism for its anti-tumor effect and improves the efficacy of anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Its surface waters are capped by the warm, low saline, nitrate-depleted Pacific Ocean outflow, that leads to intense water column stratification and chronic nutrient scarcity. During the BLOOFINZ campaign (R/V Roger Revelle, January-March 2022), we combined high-resolution underway surveys with Lagrangian experiments to examine hydrography, nutrient stoichiometry, and phytoplankton photophysiology across the basin. This study was motivated by the need to: 1) identify the phytoplankton communities capable of persisting in this nutrient-impoverished region, and 2) uncover the unique photophysiological traits that underpin their survival and growth, particularly under acute nitrate limitation. Nutrient fields revealed strongly negative N*, positive Si*, and elevated Si:P ratios, indicating a system of acute nitrate scarcity but with residual phosphate and latent silicate availability. Phytoplankton communities were dominated by the cyanobacteria, Prochlorococcus, whose survival strategies included small functional absorption cross section of PSII ({sigma}PSII), enhanced PSII connectivity (p), highly elastic and reversible diel photophysiology that balanced high-light stress and nitrogen scarcity. Longer turnover times especially {tau}2 (micro sec); PSII-PSI electron transport) seen in the region around 115o and 120oE and at 15oS, and during Cycles 3 and 4 are indicative of populations that were being stressed by Fe limitation as well. Our inference of Prochlorococcus is supported by complimentary measurements of flow cytometry, phytoplankton pigment composition and microscopy all of which confirmed the dominance of Prochlorococcus in these nutrient impoverished waters. Our observations further indicate that mesoscale eddies generated by ITF-SICC (South Indian Counter Current) interactions, can episodically shoal the nutricline, triggering transient pulses of larger eukaryotes. Collectively, these results demonstrate how acute nitrate depletion, compounded by Fe stress, structures a microbial community finely tuned to oligotrophy and capable of sustaining a short food chain involving appendicularians that directly support larval tuna.

We implement a human upper limb reaching model with muscles consisting of multiple rate-coded MUs and demonstrate its ability to generate accurate reaching movements under online control. Using this model, we investigate how reaching performance is influenced by two key features of MU pools, the number of MUs and their maximum firing rates. Our simulations suggest that very small MU pools with low firing rates tend to produce less accurate reaching movements compared to larger pools with higher firing rates. Increasing either the size of the pool or the maximum firing rate generally improves performance, but benefits become negligible beyond about 10-20 MUs and firing rates of 25-50 Hz. This pattern holds for the entire workspace but targets on the distal boundaries appear more sensitive to MU pool properties.

Deciphering how cells integrate this information is particularly important in the context of wound healing, where the timing and duration of the fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition can determine healing outcomes. Here, we discovered that fibroblasts in engineered tissues respond to directional anisotropy in stress through a hierarchical temporal cascade, with individual cell elongation (24 hr) preceding collective alignment (40 hr), which then drives -smooth muscle actin expression and myofibroblast transition (96h). To enable this discovery, we developed a modified hydrogel-assisted stereolithographic elastomer (HASTE) prototyping platform to incorporate a detergent that improves wettability of template agar hydrogels by poly(dimethylsiloxane) elastomer. HASTE allowed rapid prototyping of intricate 3D micropost arrays that provides isotropic (8-post) versus anisotropic (4-post) boundary conditions. Fibroblasts sensed and responded to stress directionality before bulk tissue reorganization occurs. Computational modeling predicted steady-state activation patterns based on initial stress anisotropy rather than magnitude, and our experiments reveal that reaching this state requires sequential mechanosensitive processes operating across distinct timescales. This temporal hierarchy persists even when extensive cell-cell contacts might be expected to mask matrix-mediated mechanical signals. Our findings demonstrate that fibroblast mechanosensing involves adaptive responses encoded through progressive cell and tissue reorganization.

However, this method can obscure subtle group overlaps or atypical cases. Voronoi tessellation, which is widely used in crystallography to analyze local structure, offers a parameter-free geometric alternative that may improve the evaluation of group structure in projected data. We compared the use of confidence ellipses and Voronoi tessellation as visualization tools for two-dimensional data projections on three artificial datasets and three biomedical datasets. For datasets with well-separated classes, both visualization techniques effectively delineated groups. Voronoi tessellation more clearly highlighted cases with projections overlapping the opposite group and revealed internal group heterogeneity. In datasets with moderate or absent group separation, Voronoi tessellation more effectively exposed the lack of meaningful structure. Meanwhile, confidence ellipses more clearly indicated distant outliers. Voronoi tessellation also facilitated the identification of clustering failures. Thus, Voronoi tessellation enhances the detection of deviations from expected group patterns and provides geometric insights that complement statistical summaries from confidence ellipses. Therefore, integrating Voronoi tessellation into standard data analysis workflows is a valuable addition for visualizing projected biomedical data and supports hypothesis validation and exploratory analyses in dimensionality reduction and clustering.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

E.; Molina, P.; Tian, L.; Plevritis, S.", "abstract": "Advancements in single-cell spatial omics technologies allow unprecedented exploration of tissue microenvironments and the discovery of tissue-specific and cell type-specific, spatially-resolved molecular patterns associated with development, pathogenesis, and drug response. However, the process of pooling spatial estimates and findings across samples while hypothesis testing for meaningful differences between groups poses challenges under limited sample size and when the degree of heterogeneity within and between samples is high. To address this challenge, we introduce DC-SPOMIC, a tool for identifying differentially colocalized cell type pairs between groups of spatial omics samples. DC-SPOMIC uses local spatial statistics of each cell in a sample to calculate colocalization between pairs of cell types and spatial bootstrapping to estimate the degree of intra-sample variation of the colocalization estimate. The estimated intra-sample variances per sample are used in a random-effects meta-analysis model, which pools cell type pair colocalization estimates across samples while estimating the overall inter-sample heterogeneity. The random-effects output provides a pooled estimate of colocalization and its precision, which can be used for downstream analysis such as hypothesis testing of differential colocalization between groups of spatial omic samples. We demonstrate the robustness of colocalization estimation and pooling across samples using DC-SPOMIC on simulated data from spatial point process models. When used to analyze distinct histological groups of colorectal cancer samples generated by CODEX, DC-SPOMIC identifies seven statistically significant pairwise spatial colocalization differences amongst immune cell populations and network analysis revealed a subnetwork of four immune cell types exhibiting higher group colocalization. By quantifying both intra- and inter- sample variability, DC-SPOMIC offers potential to uncover significant spatial interactions in complex tissues and across heterogeneous datasets.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

As ecDNA lack centromeres, their mitotic segregation does not follow traditional inheritance principles. However, the mechanisms that govern ecDNA fate following mitosis remain unclear. We found that ecDNA undergo numerical and structural optimization under increased selective pressure, with mitotic chromosomal tethering, or detachment, dictating ecDNA fate. When tethered, ecDNA aggregates promote uneven distribution into the newly formed daughter cells, thereby driving inter-cellular numerical heterogeneity and rapid increase of amplification under selective pressure. Mitotically detached ecDNA frequently encapsulate within micronuclei of variable size and content that appear to be highly fragile. Strikingly, ecDNA enclosed in very small micronuclei, which we term nanonuclei, are being actively degraded through autophagy. Together with ongoing structural rearrangements, nanonuclear ecDNA degradation promotes their structural evolution, which facilitates cancer cell adaptation.

Dimensionality reduction revealed distinct transcriptional programs, with principal component analysis (PCA) capturing key axes of heterogeneity driven by highly variable genes across clusters. These data enabled functional annotation of epithelial, immune, and stromal subpopulations and highlighted dominant patterns of regulatory T cells, activated fibroblasts, and macrophage polarization toward tumor-supportive phenotypes.

Methods: Using a highly sensitive and robust 5hmC sequencing approach on genomic DNA isolated from peripheral blood samples, we developed predictive models to identify biomarkers for peritoneal metastases. Results: We obtained genome-wide 5hmC profiles from 71 CRC/AA patients with PM, 41 without PM, and 73 non-cancer controls. Predictive models trained on genomic region 5hmC levels in patients with cancer could distinguish PM status with high sensitivity and moderate specificity (AUC 0.827, sensitivity 92.4%, specificity 46.1%). Pathway enrichment analysis identified epigenetically dysregulated cancer, cell migration, adhesion, and immune-related pathways in PM.

Although E2f is active in almost all cancer cases as a result of this disruption, the consequence of its unrestricted activity for cancer initiation remains mostly unknown. To address this question, we genetically inactivated the entire Rb family of genes (Triple Knock Out, TKO) in specific cell lineages in the liver. Strikingly, this unbiased approach reveals that Rb family inactivation initiates a phenotypically similar hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from either periportal hepatocytes or Sox9+ bile duct cells. In the latter population, Rb family inactivation results in unrestricted proliferation as well as the E2f-driven transactivation of the pioneer factor Foxa3, which activates a periportal hepatocyte-like metabolic program to ensure transdifferentiation into hepatocytes. Notably, single or compound inactivation of E2f1 and E2f3 in the TKO background is sufficient to suppress Foxa3 expression and HCC initiation, without altering the proliferative status of Sox9+ bile duct cells. Collectively, our results reveal that derepression of a cell cycle gene program and activation of non-cell cycle oncogenic features by E2f are distinct consequences of disrupting the Rb/E2f interaction, and that coordinated activation of these two functions are essential for HCC initiation from a founder liver bile duct cell lineage.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

The previous study demonstrated that HEV genotype 3 (HEV-3) inhibits complete autophagic flux in both mouse placental tissue and human trophoblast cells (JEG-3), evidenced by reduced expression of ATG proteins (including LC3, Beclin1, ATG4B, ATG5, and ATG9A) and accumulation of p62. However, the specific regulatory pathway involved remains unclear. Thus, eukaryotic expression vectors for HEV open reading frames (ORFs) were constructed, and ORF2 and ORF3 proteins were transiently overexpressed in JEG-3 cells via liposome transfection. While both ORF2 and ORF3 significantly reduced LC3B protein levels (p < 0.01), only ORF2 induced p62 accumulation (p < 0.01), indicative of autophagic inhibition, which indicates that ORF2 was the key viral protein mediating autophagy suppression in JEG-3. The results of WB and RT-qPCR show that ORF2 suppressed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway while enhancing nuclear translocation of TFEB (p < 0.01) and AMPK phosphorylation (p < 0.01), suggesting paradoxical activation of upstream autophagy regulators. Through co-transfection of mCherry-LC3 with ORF2, co-localization studies, and AlphaFold 3-based intermolecular interaction predictions, we proposed that ORF2 directly binds LC3B to block autophagosome formation. Finally, co-immunoprecipitation confirmed physical interaction between HEV ORF2 and LC3B, elucidating the molecular mechanism of HEV-induced autophagy suppression in trophoblasts.

Given its pro-inflammatory roles, we hypothesized that cathepsin S would drive other symptoms associated with IBD. Using activity-based probes, we investigated cysteine cathepsin activation in human and murine colitis. We observed a significant increase in fecal cathepsin S in patients with ulcerative colitis compared to healthy controls, while cathepsin S in mucosal biopsies was unchanged. Mice with experimental colitis exhibited a modest increase in mucosal activity of both cathepsin S and X compared to naive mice. Luminal secretion of cathepsin S was dramatically increased upon colitis induction, although differences between mouse colonies were observed. To investigate the contribution of cathepsin S and cathepsin X to colitis, we induced colitis in cathepsin-deficient mice. Cathepsin X-deficient mice exhibited no clear differences in disease indicators compared to wild-type mice. While cathepsin S-deficient mice exhibited less rectal bleeding, less splenomegaly and marginally improved histological scores, weight loss, diarrhea, colon shortening, and myeloperoxidase activity were not significantly different from wild-type mice. To determine whether pharmacologic inhibition of cathepsin S activity would ameliorate symptoms of colitis, a reversible inhibitor LY3000328 was administered to mice at the initiation of colitis. LY3000328 provoked a clear upregulation of cathepsin S and L activity in the mucosa, most likely through a compensatory mechanism. This increase in protease activity was associated with exacerbated histological scores and splenomegaly. Collectively, these results suggest that cathepsin S, but not cathepsin X, may contribute to some of the symptoms of experimental colitis. While cathepsin S has potential to be a therapeutic target in colitis, improved strategies to sustain its inhibition are required in future.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Core and accessory components of the polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), the epigenetic regulatory machineries, repress the transcription of genes that positively regulate the somatic embryogenesis in seedlings. Recent studies revealed that Arabidopsis thaliana SEED DORMANCY 4-LIKE (AtSDR4L), as an accessory protein to the PRC regulatory module, represses the embryo developmental program for a successful switch from seed to seedling. However, little is known about the regulation of cell differentiation by AtSDR4L in seedlings.

We further demonstrate that mutations in AtSDR4L and DIG2 lead to the formation of somatic embryo-like structures and a delay in cellular differentiation. Thus, transcriptional changes reflected by morphological defects associated with somatic embryogenesis in Atsdr4l dig2 mutants suggest that AtSDR4L and DIG2 prevent the dedifferentiation of cells for proper seedling growth through the transcriptional control of cell identity.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Drift was the primary driver of community assembly in polar communities. The polar microbial communities exhibited the highest modularity and network robustness, but were more vulnerable to hub removal.

However, its role in astrocytes remains poorly defined. Given the genetic and pathological links of BAG3 to proteostasis and neurodegenerative diseases, we investigated how BAG3 contributes to astrocyte function and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: SnRNA-seq of the human brain determined cell type expression of BAG3. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in human iPSCs, followed by tandem mass tag-mass spectrometry and RNA-sequencing was performed to assess proteomic and transcriptomic changes following BAG3 loss. Co-immunoprecipitation of BAG3 in human astrocytes defined the interactome, with top interactors being validated by western blot (WB), AlphaFold modeling, and proximity ligation assays. In astrocytes, autophagic flux, lysosomal phenotypes, proteasome activity, and endocytic uptake were measured in BAG3 KO and BAG3 WT. Finally, BAG3 expression was assessed in postmortem AD brain by WB and snRNA-seq, and its functional relevance to amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) degradation was tested in co-cultures of BAG3 KO iAs with familial AD neurons. Results: In human brain and iPSC models, BAG3 was most highly expressed in astrocytes. Further, BAG3 loss caused greater proteomic disruption in astrocytes than in neurons. In the absence of BAG3, astrocytes showed reduced autophagy, diminished lysosome abundance and activity, and decreased proteasome function. To uncover molecular binding partners of BAG3 that might influence these phenotypes, we performed co-immunoprecipitation, revealing interactions with HSPB8 and other heat shock proteins, proteasome regulators (PSMD5, PSMF1), and the retromer component, VPS35. Integration of BAG3 KO transcriptomic and proteomic datasets pinpointed AD-relevant proteins under post-translational control of BAG3, which included GFAP, BIN1, and HSPB8. HSPB8 levels were markedly reduced in BAG3-deficient astrocytes with overexpression partially rescuing its levels. Loss of astrocytic BAG3 impaired A{beta} clearance in co-culture with APP/PSEN1 mutant neurons, directly linking BAG3 to a disease-relevant astrocyte function. Finally, analysis of postmortem brain tissue revealed BAG3 marks a stress-responsive astrocyte subtype in the brain of aged individuals with AD.

However, there is a lack of research in the progression of AD through the neurofibrillary tangle mechanism. Tau is a microtubule stabilizing protein that becomes unstable when hyperphosphorylated. Hyperphosphorylated tau misfolds, resulting in toxic aggregates that accumulate to create neurofibrillary tangles.

In a murine micro-aspiration model, the combination of oral commensals and Mycobacterium led to a sustained pro-inflammatory immune response marked by an increase in Th17, gamma delta T cells, PD-1+ T lymphocytes as well as higher NET levels. Conclusions: Our analyses showed that distinct microbiome features beyond the primary pathogen can contribute to neutrophilic inflammation and severe disease phenotypes in bronchiectasis/ NTM-LD.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Unlike conventional antibodies, TCRms are designed to recognize peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) complexes that present intracellular tumor-derived peptides on the cell surface. Due to the typically low surface abundance and high sequence similarity of pHLAs, TCRms require high affinity and exceptional specificity to avoid off-target toxicity. Conventional methods for off-target identification such as sequence similarity searches, motif-based screening, and structural modelling focus on the peptide and are limited in detecting cross-reactive peptides with little or no sequence homology to the target. To address this gap, we developed EpiPredict, a TCRm-specific machine learning framework trained on high-throughput kinetic off-target screening data. EpiPredict learns an antibody-specific mapping from peptide sequence to binding strength, enabling prediction of interactions with unmeasured pHLA sequences, including sequence-dissimilar peptides. We applied EpiPredict to two distinct TCRms targeting the cancer-testis antigen MAGE-A4. The model successfully predicted multiple off-targets with minimal sequence similarity to the intended epitope, many of which were experimentally validated via T2 cell binding assays. These findings establish EpiPredict as a valuable tool for lead optimization of TCRms, enabling the identification of antibody-specific off-targets beyond the scope of traditional peptide-centric methods and supporting the preclinical de-risking of TCRm-based therapies.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is its most common form. Higher intraocular pressure (IOP), resulting from impaired aqueous humour outflow, is the cardinal mediating factor, and all proven treatments aim to lower IOP. POAG is a complex genetic disease with numerous loci linked to POAG and higher IOP. The mechanisms by which risk alleles cause disease remain unclear. Here, using primary trabecular meshwork (TM) cells, a cell type controlling outflow, and mice, we found that the POAG-associated gene KALRN encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated Rac regulator essential for TM homeostasis and normal IOP. KALRN loss caused widespread disruption from ER to calcium homeostasis and energy metabolism, leading to induction of cell senescence. KALRN-depletion also led to suppression of the ER translocase and calcium regulator TMCO1, encoded by a gene at one of the most significantly associated genomic loci for POAG. TMCO1-depletion in vitro and in vivo phenocopied KALRN-induced phenotypes, and reduced KALRN expression. These findings establish KALRN and TMCO1 as interdependent regulators of TM homeostasis and IOP, that link regulation of ER and intracellular calcium homeostasis to cell and tissue physiology, and illustrate how different genes linked to glaucoma can form regulatory pathways.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

As a highly conserved membraneless organelle present across all three domains of life, cytoophidia display dynamic behaviors that are crucial for cellular homeostasis and function. Previous research has shown that cytoophidia are actively transported from nurse cells to oocytes, implicating their potential role in Drosophila oogenesis. Nevertheless, the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing cytoophidium dynamics remain largely unclear. In this study, we employ live-cell imaging to systematically characterize the spatiotemporal dynamics of cytoophidia and to explore the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that cytoophidium dynamics are dependent on the cytoskeletal components -- microtubules, microfilaments (actin filaments), and myosin II. Notably, disruption of either microtubules or microfilaments resulted in the disassembly or depolymerization of large cytoophidia (macro-cytoophidia), highlighting an essential role of the cytoskeleton in maintaining cytoophidium integrity and assembly. Together, these results indicate that microtubules, microfilaments, and myosin II play pivotal roles in regulating cytoophidium dynamics. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying cytoophidium transport and assembly, and lays a foundation for further investigation of their functional significance in Drosophila oogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

We and others recently discovered a mitotic role for the CIP2A oncoprotein, which is critically implicated in chromosome stability maintenance and chromosome fragment clustering during mitosis. In addition, in homologous recombination deficient (HRD) cells, CIP2A is essential and may thus constitute a new drug target in HRD cancers. Yet, the precise mechanisms by which CIP2A suppresses chromosomal instability during mitosis and thus allows for the survival of HRD cancer cells remain largely elusive. Here we characterize CIP2A's role in DNA replication stress responses. We show that upon replication stress, wild-type cells show an elevated accumulation of CIP2A foci during mitosis, indicating its involvement in the mitotic response to replication stress. Defective DNA replication leads to the accumulation of under-replicated DNA, which can be carried into mitosis. We demonstrate that in the absence of CIP2A, cells fail to recruit the SLX4-MUS81-XPF (SMX) tri-nuclease complex to sites of under-replicated DNA in mitosis, resulting in a high incidence of lagging chromosomes during anaphase and subsequent micronuclei formation. In a subset of cell lines, we also observed CIP2A-dependent mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS) upon replication stress. However, our data suggest that MiDAS and SMX recruitment are not functionally linked. This novel role of CIP2A in managing under-replicated DNA may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic vulnerabilities in cancer cells.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we examined functional redundancy and potential for insurance in soil microbial communities disturbed by an ongoing underground fire in Centralia, Pennsylvania, USA, using seven years of deep metagenome sequencing from heated and reference sites. Analyses of taxonomic and functional diversity showed that functional redundancy increased with disturbance intensity, driven by declines in both diversity and average genome size. Biogeochemistry-relevant metabolisms, such as carbohydrate and nitrogen pathways, showed greater per-genome investment with disturbance intensity, indicating enhanced redundancy. However, transcription factor evenness, linked to community environmental responsiveness, was lower in heated soils. Thus, prolonged disturbance that imposes a strong selection can increase redundancy and near-term stability while simultaneously diminishing insurance potential against future stress, revealing tradeoffs between these mechanisms in microbial community resilience.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Marine fisheries are a critical source of protein and essential micronutrients for billions of people worldwide, supporting both local diets and global food security. International trade shapes modern blue food systems, influencing broader distributions and availability of these \"blue nutrients.\" Yet, the structure of these trade networks, the nutritional composition of exported fisheries, and the implications for local food security remain poorly understood. Using global marine fisheries trade data from 1996-2020 combined with species-level nutrient compositions, we analyzed production, consumption, and nutrient balances for 12 PICs and used network analysis to characterize the structure of international blue nutrient flows. Here we show that many PICs experience persistent net losses of essential nutrients, particularly vitamin B12, protein, and fatty acids. This results in nutrient yields far below population needs, with only a few PICs (Vanuatu and Kiribati) meeting average requirements. Compared to global trade networks, the regional PICs trade is more modular, less reciprocal, and less clustered, implying reliance on a few intermediaries (Papua New Guinea and Fiji). Despite high domestic production and consumption, 54% of blue nutrients are exported from PICs rather than retained locally, leaving local nutritional deficits unaddressed even as PICs supply global seafood markets. Combining trade, nutrient, and network analyses can help inform strategies to increase nutrient retention, strengthen food security, and support resilience for PICs in the modern blue food economy.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

However, disentangling these drivers has been challenging due to the lack of comprehensive datasets across multiple lineages in the same geographical arena. The flora of the Canary Islands includes hundreds of plant lineages with contrasting species richness and harbours the highest number of species that evolved their woodiness in-situ ('insular woodiness'). Here, we present a phylogenomic reconstruction for Canary Island angiosperms and show that diversity unevenness in the flora is not driven by lineage age but by trait-dependent diversification and spatio-ecological limits. Our phylogenomic dataset, based on 1,244 newly generated and 501 published DNA sequences for 669 Canary Island species and 771 closely related mainland taxa, allows us to simultaneously study 435 plant lineages (~50% of total). Applying dynamic stochastic modelling, we find the flora is shaped by high extinction and colonisation rates, maintaining a macroevolutionary equilibrium. Additionally, insular woody lineages exhibit higher diversification rates than the remaining flora. Our results suggest the uneven diversity of a highly dynamic insular region can be explained by the interaction of trait evolution and ecological constraints, providing insights into island biodiversity dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

From haplotype-resolved phylogenies of >500 wild-caught individuals, we infer a single, recent (~8,000 years) origin of all hybrids. The ancestral hybrid reproduced via hybridogenesis, which subsequently diversified into parthenogenesis and, twice independently, into triploid lineages.

Predictive models, called epigenetic clocks, are being built across the tree of life, including humans, other mammals and vertebrates and, recently, invertebrates. However, it always involves cross-fertilizing organisms, thus presenting a high level of genetic diversity. To decipher the exact role of epigenetics in adaptation and evolution, distinguishing true epigenetic variation from changes that reflect genetic variation is essential. Results: Here, we used the mangrove rivulus, the only self-fertilizing vertebrate, to study epigenetic aging in the brain and construct an epigenetic clock. We generated a reduced representation bisulfite sequencing dataset of 90 brain tissues from individuals aged 60-1100 days to construct a highly accurate age predictor using 40 CpG sites (R squared > 0.96, mean absolute error of 28.7 days). We associated the CpG sites with their respective closest genes and explored their biological functions. Genes relevant to aging include lamin-A (responsible for several age-related processes), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (whose absence causes premature aging) and several genes associated with Alzheimer's disease identified in human studies. We also propose several methods to improve classic epigenetic clock regression. Conclusions: This study is the first construction of an epigenetic clock in a self-fertilizing species, demonstrating that DNA methylation patterns undergo consistent changes across the lifespan of isogenic individuals. These findings emphasize putative changes in DNA methylation related to functional changes across aging in the brain.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

While the ascaroside family of small molecules that mediate short-range attraction is well characterized, the identities and roles of volatile sex pheromones (VSPs) that act over longer ranges remain unknown. Using GC-MS analysis of crude VSP extracts, we identified cyclohexyl acetate (CA) as a candidate mimic, sharing retention time and mass spectral features with natural VSPs. Behavioral assays demonstrated that CA acts as a concentration-dependent, male-specific attractant in Caenorhabditis. Pre-exposure to VSPs induced cross-adaptation to CA, suggesting shared sensory processing. Surprisingly, genetic and calcium imaging analyses revealed that CA perception is mediated primarily by AWCon (str-2-expressing) neurons and involves VSPs chemoreceptor srd-1-independent pathways, which are distinct from the neural pathways involved in natural VSPs perception. These findings establish that CA is not a major component of VSPs but a structural and functional mimic of nematode VSPs, operating through a parallel sensory circuit. Although the endogenous source of CA remains unknown, its structural and behavioral mimicry provides new insights into the complexity of chemosensory signaling and the potential for interspecies chemical eavesdropping in nematode ecology.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

The spine's intervertebral disc's (IVD) load-bearing capacity depends on a hierarchical extracellular matrix, where plywood-like lamellae of collagen fibres in the annulus fibrosus contain nanometre-scale fibrils built from staggered triple-helical monomers. How intact IVDs couple fibril-scale mechanics to fibre-scale organisation under load remains unresolved. Here we introduce TomoSAXS, a full-field 3D small-angle X-ray scattering tomography that maps fibril-to-fibre mechanics across an intact tissue. We show that intrafibrillar molecular pre-strain (D-period stagger) is lamellar textured and tightly correlated with microscale fibre strain. Pre-strain is inversely related to fibril strain and its variability, consistent with load-sharing through molecular unwinding. Radial strain bridges and high-curvature zones at the annulus fibrosus-nucleus pulposus interfaces emerge as critical regulators of local mechanics. These findings reveal concerted fibril-fibre interactions that sustain mechanical equilibrium in the IVD, preserving elasticity and shape.

Clinical studies with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are encouraging for immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy (anti-PD-1 with paclitaxel and/or carboplatin). However, additional clinical advances may be accelerated by leveraging preclinical TNBC models including syngeneic mammary tumor cell lines. Here, we report two syngeneic mammary tumor cell lines that exhibit differential responsiveness to immunotherapy in vivo. Methods: Spontaneous mammary tumors from C57BL/6J MMTV-Cre Trp53fl/+ animals were passaged serially in cell culture and in vivo in the mammary fat pad of fully wildtype animals. The resulting lines, MM001i and MM008i, lost Trp53 and formed 1000 mm3 tumors in the mammary fat pad within 21-28 days. Tumors from each group were analyzed for their response to anti-Pd-1 and anti-Ctla-4 immunotherapy, infiltrating immune populations, and transcriptional profiles. Results: Despite originating from the same genetic background, these lines exhibit differential responses to immunotherapy. For anti-Pd-1 therapy, MM001i is poorly responsive and MM008i is strongly responsive with near-complete tumor regression. In comparison, both MM001i and MM008i respond rapidly to anti-Ctla-4 therapy. Both models express unique tumor antigens as evidenced by immunity to subsequent engraftments. Primary MM008i tumors exhibit greater T cell infiltration, and CD8-positive T lymphocytes are required for anti-Pd-1 responses. Cancer epithelial cells within MM008i tumors demonstrate a greater abundance of Pd-l1 expressing cells, correlating with observations in human TNBC where PD-L1 expression is a biomarker for anti-PD-1 response.

Whether RAS-like homologous mutations in RRAS/RRAS2 are oncogenic and actionable drivers in lung cancer remains underexplored. Methods: An institutional cohort of 8,488 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples profiled by comprehensive targeted DNA sequencing (MSK-IMPACT) between 2016-2024 was evaluated for RRAS/RRAS2 mutations. Missense mutations in RRAS/RRAS2 homologous to RAS family hotspot mutations were modeled in murine IL3-dependent Ba/F3 cells and immortalized human bronchiolar epithelial cells (HBEC). The oncogenic potential, signaling characteristics, and sensitivity to PI3K and MAPK inhibitors, including the novel pan-RAS inhibitor RMC-6236, were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Results: RRASQ87L or RRAS2Q72L variants, homologous to KRAS-codon 61 substitutions, were found in ~0.45% of NSCLCs (38/8,488), with all but two lacking other RTK-MAPK oncogenic drivers. RRASQ87L and RRAS2Q72L mutations were transforming in Ba/F3 and HBEC cells and resulted in strong MAPK and PI3K-mTOR pathway activation.

Here, we describe a new reporter zebrafish line, termed half-vdbp-NanoLuc, in which the vitamin D-binding protein is coupled to NanoLuc luciferase, for rapid, large-scale detection of PT dysfunction and LMW proteinuria. We demonstrate the reliability and value of the half-vdbp-NanoLuc biosensor in fish models of monogenic endolysosomal diseases, gentamicin and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, and metal contamination. This novel system provides mechanistic insights into the cadmium- and copper-induced PT dysfunction and, when combined with a swimming test, a platform for drug screening to alleviate cisplatin toxicity.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

During the postmenopausal period, various changes have been documented, including atrophy of the vaginal mucosa and a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, particularly affecting the vaginal mucosa, which contributes to symptomatic deterioration and reduced quality of life. In this study, a chitosan-based polymeric gel was used as a delivery matrix for natural compounds, such as growth factors derived from platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and a hydroalcoholic extract of Uncaria tomentosa (UG), for intravaginal application in a menopausal animal model with vaginal atrophy. A 20% concentration of platelet lysate (PL), with or without UG, showed comparable outcomes to estrogen treatment, including restoration of the squamous epithelium, increasing the number of epithelial layers in the vaginal lining with histological evidence of absent chronic inflammatory infiltration. In contrast, 30% PL alone promoted epithelial repair without inflammation; however, when combined with UG, it failed to support tissue repair and was associated with chronic inflammation. Our findings suggest that a 20% platelet lysate formulation may effectively reverse vaginal atrophy without inducing adverse inflammatory responses. This formulation may represent a viable non-hormonal therapeutic option for managing postmenopausal vaginal atrophy to improve the clinical and histological characteristics of postmenopausal vaginal tissues.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Here, Tree Manifold Approximation and Projection (TMAP) were applied, with the aim of reducing the dimensionality of large toxicological dataset, providing the foundations to data imputation methods allowing to get an understanding of chemical modes of action. Specifically, TMAP was implemented using MHFP6 fingerprints and the NORMAN SusDat database, containing over 100000 compounds. Physicochemical properties and CTD toxicogenomic data were retrieved and a graph-based spatial imputation function was generated to obtain insights into the potential ecotoxicity mechanisms of data poor chemicals. The relevance and meaningfulness of TMAP chemical space was explored for Daphnia magna, Pimephales promelas and Algae. Chemical classes known to be structurally similar were found to be grouped together in the TMAP chemical space, while heterogeneous classes were found to be sparse. Data imputation allowed for the identification of known and potential chemical mechanisms of action. Indeed, acethylcolinesterase and transthyretin were confirmed as major mechanisms of action of organothiophosphate and brominated flame retardant toxicity in Daphnia magna and Pimephales promelas, respectively.

In prior work we have shown that DR and mTOR suppression modulate the expression of the spliceosome in the fly (Drosophila melanogaster). Here, we manipulated the five top genes that change in expression in both these treatments. We found that knockdown (using conditional in vivo RNAi in adults) of some spliceosome components rapidly induce mortality, whereas one, Rbp1, extends lifespan. Treatments that have more instant benefits on longevity are more translatable. We therefore subsequently repeated the Rbp1 experiment, but initiating Rbp1 at later stages in adult life. We find that irrespective of age of induction, knockdown of Rbp1 extends lifespan. Our results posit the spliceosome itself as a hub of regulation that when targeted can extend lifespan, rendering it a promising target for geroscience.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Climate impacts have caused global yield stagnation and quantifying the climatic variables influencing wheat yield is critical to anticipate yield losses and design climate-resilient agricultural strategies. Here, we use a unique 30-year dataset on winter wheat variety trials in six sites across Switzerland, explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and interpretable machine learning (IML) methods (i.e., decision trees and gradient boosting models combined with post hoc tests) to elucidate climate drivers on wheat yields. We showed based on 405 varieties and over 10000 observations, that climatic variables such as cumulative solar radiation, precipitation from sowing to harvest and genotype makeup are significant yield drivers. Partial dependence plots and variable interaction analyses revealed, for example, a yield plateau above cumulative solar radiation levels of 3000 MJ /m2, suggesting complex genotype-by-environment interactions. These findings suggest that XAI adds important biological interpretability to predictive performance, and reveals the mechanisms how climate affects wheat yields.

We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of isolated immune cells adjacent to high-risk bladders before and after BCG in BCG responders and non-responders. We identify an increase in Th17-like Th1 cells in BCG responders, characterized by greater expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Alternatively, non-responders had increased CD8+ T-cell exhaustion and T-regulatory cells. We identify that the primary mechanism of divergent T cell activity is driven by altered polarization and immunosuppressive signaling with myeloid cells. Through a machine-learning-based approach, we identified a Th17-like Th1 cytokines, such as IL17, IL21, and IL26, were predictive of a response, which were then validated in a separate BCG-treated BCa cohort.

These macrophages occupy discrete anatomical niches and display distinct replenishment kinetics. They all accumulate during acute colitis and Cx3cr1-based fate mapping shows that they persist through to inflammation resolution.

Live imaging and electron microscopy in compartmentalized cultures revealed that soma surface-derived TrkA receptors undergo dynamic movements in axons and are housed in endosomes and multi-vesicular bodies. Soma-surface labeled TrkA appear in nerve terminals, demonstrating transcytosis occurs in vivo. Notably, transcytosed TrkA receptors are enriched at presynaptic varicosities.

ER three-way junctions function as nanoscopic hubs where cargo pauses, contacts multiple microtubules, and then launches onto a track for long-range travel. Remarkably, the ER maintains a membrane tether to the departing cargo, extending its tubules and forming new junctions, thereby coupling inter-network transfer with membrane morphogenesis.

Despite this, corals can sometimes survive often altering their symbiont composition toward more thermally-tolerant taxa in response to thermal stress. The long-term efficacy of such a strategy remains poorly understood, in particular, the function of bleaching as an acclimation agent. Here, we use a model of coral-symbiont dynamics, which includes novel and empirically intractable aspects of symbiont thermal tolerance, to investigate how changes in coral endosymbiont composition influence reef survival under differing patterns of heat stress. We find that thermal stress-induced bleaching can act as an acclimation mechanism, but its effectiveness is modulated by the interplay between thermal stress intensity and frequency. When thermal stress remains moderate in frequency and intensity, acclimation can occur as longer intervals between stress events promote post-bleaching coral recovery via a beneficial sequence of hosting thermally-tolerant then thermally-sensitive symbionts, interspersing thermal resilience with periods of faster coral growth. In contrast, when thermal stress intensity increases rapidly and occurs at higher frequency, sustained dominance of thermally-tolerant symbionts is favoured, providing a temporary survival strategy that delays reef collapse but with the trade-off of lower coral growth. While in this latter scenario, acclimation may be less effective due to disrupted reef population structure, it does provide a mechanism for corals to buy time, during which other adaptive processes may occur enabling longer-term coral survival. However, under a real-world low emission IPCC future scenario, even this flexible survival strategy may still lead to an immediate and sustained fall in coral cover. By capturing both, 1) thermal frequency and intensity dynamics, along with, 2) symbiont thermotolerance preferences and linked growth trade-offs we provide a coral survival model which can be used as a tool to inform strategic coral reef management frameworks promoting reef resilience.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

PlanktonFlow automates image pre-processing, model training and calculation of performance metrics for four different convolution neural network architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet, and YOLOv11), as well as inference on novel datasets. We highlight the potentialities of PlanktonFlow by comparing the relative performances of the four models and of the web-service EcoTaxa on classifying images from freshwater samples including 76 classes of both living and non-living objects. EfficientNet-B5 achieved the highest macro-averaged F1 score, outperforming EcoTaxa as well as other models. Despite class imbalance and morphological complexity, all models generalized well across frequent and rare taxa, highlighting the relevancy of the pre-processing routine.

Yet, conventional fluorescence imaging can suffer from phototoxicity, limited labeling efficiency, or perturbation of biological function. Label-free techniques such as interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) offer a powerful alternative by detecting nanoscale structures based on their light scattering, without the need for dyes or genetic tags. iSCAT has enabled high-sensitivity detection of single proteins and viruses on clean surfaces. More recently, its application to live cells has been extended by using confocal illumination and detection, allowing suppression of out-of-focus light, yielding subcellular structures with high contrast. This development laid the foundation for biologically relevant label-free imaging. Here, we introduce interferometric image scanning microscopy (iISM). This next-generation technique combines interferometric detection with image scanning microscopy to achieve about 120 nm lateral resolution while operating at tenfold lower incident illumination power per diffraction limited spot, significantly reducing photodamage while enhancing signal-to-noise and contrast. Using iISM, we are able to visualize intracellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, actin cytoskeleton, mitochondria, and vesicles in live cells at essentially unlimited observation times. Importantly, iISM can be readily combined with confocal fluorescence microscopy, enabling correlation of label-free dynamics and structural information with molecular specificity. Our approach opens new avenues for studying dynamic biological processes, such as host-pathogen interactions, intracellular trafficking, or cytoskeletal rearrangements, under label-free, near-native conditions. iISM thus offers a powerful new tool for high-resolution, low-impact imaging of live cells, paving the way for new biological insights.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Competition assays yielded an IC50 of 5.55 nM, and preliminary autoradiography demonstrated heterogeneous regional distribution in the brain with specific binding.

Using white lupin (Lupinus albus) as a model, we provide a comprehensive proteomic characterization of seed mitochondria in a legume with protein-rich reserves. Highly enriched mitochondrial fractions isolated from quiescent seeds revealed fully assembled oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes and supercomplexes, demonstrating that mitochondria are preconfigured for immediate energy production upon imbibition. Quantitative proteomics identified 1,162 mitochondrial proteins and highlighted marked tissue-specific differences compared to leaves, including distinct transporter profiles and a dehydrogenase complement supporting amino acid and fatty acid catabolism. Early germination was accompanied by remodeling of coenzyme metabolism and transport capacity, while core respiratory complexes remained stable. Notably, ~12% of the proteome consisted of uncharacterized proteins, many of which displayed dynamic changes during early germination, suggesting yet undiscovered, potentially legume-specific mitochondrial functions.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we address the interpretability challenges associated with predicting transcriptional activation domains from protein sequence. Activation domains, regions within transcription factors that drive gene expression, were traditionally difficult to predict due to their sequence diversity and poor conservation. Multiple deep neural networks can now accurately predict activation domains, but these predictors are difficult to interpret. With the goal of interpretability, we designed simple neural networks that incorporated biophysical models of activation domains. The simplicity of these neural networks allowed us to visualize their parameters and directly interpret what the networks learned. The biophysical neural networks revealed two new ways that arrangement (i.e. the sequence grammar) of activation domain controlled function: 1) hydrophobic residues both increase activation domain strength and decrease protein abundance, and 2) acidic residues control both activation domain strength and protein abundance. Notably, the biophysical neural networks helped us to recognize the same signatures in complex interpreters of the deeper neural networks. We demonstrate how combining biophysical and deep neural networks maximizes both prediction accuracy and interpretability to yield insights into biological mechanisms.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Resting CBHP network patterns have yet to be established in young adults. Mapping the normative resting-state CBHP connectivity pattern is essential for identifying when CBHP circuitry becomes behaviorally relevant across the lifespan and for detecting early circuit-level deviations that may precede neurodegenerative or endocrine disruption. We combined resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) with measures of cognition in 1,081 healthy young adults (22 to 37 years, 54% women) from the Human Connectome Project S1200 to map CBHP functional connectivity (FC), examine sex differences, and define its relationship with performance across episodic memory, visuospatial, and executive function tasks. Region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI FC between the right cerebellum and left hippocampus were quantified. In our CB-HP mapping, we found: 1) negative relationships between the entire HP axis and cerebellar regions: vermis VII; lobules VI, VIIb, and VIII; Crus I & II, and 2) positive relationships between most of the HP axis and ventral/medial cerebellar regions. We revealed sex differences in CB-HP such that females had greater FC than males between anterior to mid-hippocampal regions and medial cerebellar regions: vermis IV-VI; lobules VI, VIII, IX; and Crus II. We predicted CBHP FC patterns would show strong positive associations with cognitive measures (i.e., episodic memory, visuospatial processing, working memory, and executive function); however, we did not find any associations after multiple comparisons correction (pFDR > 0.05). Together, our findings detail a functional atlas of the CBHP circuit in young adulthood and highlight sex differences within.

Availability of large scale longitudinal MRI datasets enables us to probe brain changes in health and disease, and derive longitudinal trajectories of brain morphometry based measures to estimate brain atrophy and other disease-related abnormalities. In contrast to their cross-sectional counterparts, image processing pipelines that have been designed for longitudinal data can reduce noise in the derived measurements by disentangling the within and between subject variabilities, improving the sensitivity of the downstream models in detecting more subtle longitudinal changes. Here we present PELICAN, our open source multi-contrast longitudinal image processing pipeline, that has been designed and extensively validated for use in longitudinal settings and populations with neurodegenerative disorders. PELICAN can use population specific average templates as intermediate targets to derive accurate nonlinear registrations for cases with substantial levels of atrophy, which commonly used pipelines struggle to process. We evaluated PELICAN's performance across over 34,000 MRIs from multiple aging and neurodegenerative disorder cohorts, and compared its reliability and failure rates against FreeSurfer as a widely used image processing tool, showing superior performance of PELICAN compared to FreeSurfer, both in terms of failure rate and reliability.

N.; Bell, S.; Solomon, A.; Kliman, H.; Tal, A.; Tal, R.", "abstract": "Background: Macrophages play essential roles in uterine physiology during pregnancy and the postpartum (PP) period. In various organ systems, macrophages exhibit distinct M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory) polarization states, the balance of which is key not only in scarless wound healing but also in pathological fibrosis. While macrophages are central players in PP uterine remodeling, their polarization dynamics during this period and associated spatial distribution remain largely unknown. Methods: Uterine tissues were collected from C57BL/6J wild-type mice at various PP days (PPD 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28) and non-pregnant controls. Multicolor flow cytometry was used to analyze immune populations and macrophage polarization states. Macrophage polarization was determined using CD86 (M1 marker) and CD206 (M2 marker). Immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to examine the colocalization of M1 and/or M2 markers alongside F4/80 to assess macrophage polarization status and tissue distribution. Results: On PPD1, uterine macrophage numbers were higher compared to all other time points, with significantly increased M2 macrophages (CD86-CD206+) (43% p<0.0001) compared to PPD3 (5.1%), PPD7 (2.4%), PPD14 (2.3%), and non-pregnant (1.9%). A rapid polarization shift to M1 macrophages (CD86+CD206-) occurred on PPD3 (50.6%), PPD7 (66.5%), and PPD14 (58.8%) compared to PPD1 (11.9% p<0.0001). Additionally, there was a trend of increased M2 macrophages on PPD21 (10%) and PPD28 (5%). We observed a unique macrophage subset of mixed phenotype (co-expressing CD86+CD206+) significantly higher on PPD 1 (37.2% p<0.05) compared to NP (7.8%), PPD7 (11.6%), and PPD14 (26.4%). IF co-staining confirmed these dynamics, showing the highest percentage of macrophages co-expressing CD206+F4/80+ on PPD1 (77.2%), significantly higher than all other time points. IHC revealed the specific temporal and spatial distribution of F4/80+ and CD206+ cells within the uterine endometrial stroma adjacent to the myometrial junction in the early PP period. Conclusions: The predominance of M2-polarized macrophages on PPD1 followed by a rapid shift to M1 phenotype from PPD3 to PPD14 indicates an evolving inflammatory response during the early postpartum period. Repolarization to M2 profile on PPD21, along with increased abundance of a mixed population (M1/M2), uncovers the dynamic complexity of macrophage polarization during PP uterine remodeling, providing new insights into scarless uterine tissue repair.

Mammalian SIgA, which is typically dimeric, is well characterized; however, avian IgA structure-function relationships and how they compare to those in mammals remains unclear. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of mallard duck pIgA and SIgA at 3.76-[A] and 3.21-[A] resolution, respectively. Both structures revealed four IgA monomers linked through one joining chain (JC) and adopted a non-planar conformation; a heavy chain domain absent in mammals, extended the tetramer's non-planar geometry toward antigen binding sites. The SIgA structure revealed four secretory component (SC) domains binding IgA and JC analogous to four of the five mammalian SC domains; however, SC and JC N-terminal extensions, absent in mammals, mediated additional interfaces between complex components. Experiments comparing mammalian and avian SC binding to cognate and non-cognate IgA ligands demonstrated that species-specific structural differences correlated with differences in SC binding and that adding an N-terminal extension to mammalian SC enhanced binding to avian pIgA. Together, results and comparison to published structures indicate that avian IgA components co-evolved unique elements compared to mammalian IgA, including a predominantly tetrameric state, and suggest that birds may employ different IgA effector mechanisms to combat mucosal pathogens compared to mammals. These findings are broadly relevant to understanding IgA evolution and function and combating zoonotic disease such as avian influenza A virus.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

The permeability coefficient (Papp) for 4 kDa FITC-dextran, a common measure for paracellular transport, is 3.7 x 10-6 cm/s, comparable to established endothelial models such as HUVEC or corneal endothelium.

K.; Yue, Z.; Ball, G.; Booth, A. J.; Tanaka, T. U.", "abstract": "For correct chromosome segregation, kinetochore-microtubule interactions must be efficiently and properly established during prometaphase. For this, the locations of chromosomes in the nucleus or relative to spindle poles are crucial: indeed, chromosomes at the nuclear periphery or behind spindle poles (polar regions) have a higher risk of missegregation in the subsequent anaphase. The actomyosin network (PANEM) is formed on the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope during prophase, and its myosin-II-dependent contraction facilitates kinetochore-microtubule interaction shortly after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). However, it remains unclear which step of kinetochore-microtubule interaction is facilitated by the PANEM contraction, or which chromosomes specifically benefit from it. Here we show that the PANEM contraction pushes chromosomes located at the nuclear periphery inward immediately after NEBD. This facilitates kinetochores' initial interaction with spindle microtubules, but does not affect their subsequent poleward motion. The PANEM contraction also promotes the onset of their congression towards the spindle mid-plane, but does not affect congression itself once it starts. Furthermore, the PANEM contraction reduces the volume of polar regions, and helps chromosomes exit these regions and initiate their congression. Impaired PANEM contraction results in defective chromosome congression and frequent chromosome mis-segregation. In conclusion, shortly after NEBD, the PANEM contraction repositions chromosomes from the nuclear periphery and polar regions to facilitate productive kinetochore-microtubule interaction and ensure high-fidelity chromosome segregation.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

A.; Backenstose, N. J. C.; Chang, S. L.; Tan, M.; Almeida-Silva, F.; Krabbenhoft, T. J.", "abstract": "While genomic data are powerfully informative for phylogenetic inference, traditional sequence-based analyses can be confounded by issues like homoplasy and incomplete lineage sorting, leaving deep nodes unresolved. Synteny, the conservation of gene order along a chromosome, presents a promising alternative source of phylogenetic information that is potentially less prone to these issues. Here we compare sequence and synteny phylogenetic phylogenomic approaches to unravel the evolutionary history of Cypriniformes, one of the most species-rich lineages of freshwater fishes. This clade has been plagued by uncertainty, particularly concerning the phylogenetic relationships between its four major subclades: Gyrinocheilidae (algae eaters), Catostomidae (suckers), Cobitoidei (loaches), and Cyprinoidei (minnows and carps). Phylogenomic approaches require high-quality genomic resources, which have been lacking for the family Gyrinocheilidae, a key lineage for understanding cypriniform evolution. To address this, we generated the first chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation for the Chinese Algae Eater (Gyrinocheilus aymonieri). We utilized this new genome along with 42 other fish genomes to conduct comprehensive phylogenomic analyses and compare results from sequence-based methods with a microsynteny-based approach. Although chromosome-level macrosynteny is broadly conserved among cypriniforms, we demonstrate that microsynteny has impressive power to resolve deep phylogenetic nodes. Both sequence-based and microsynteny-based analyses find that Gyrinocheilidae is the sister lineage to all other cypriniforms, resolving a long-standing phylogenetic point of contention. However, while sequence-based analyses provided weak support for the relationships among the remaining subclades, our microsynteny analysis revealed a novel and strongly supported sister relationship between Catostomidae and Cyprinoidei. This conclusion is supported by a 3- to 12-fold greater number of shared microsynteny clusters (synapomorphies) compared to the alternative topologies. We also demonstrate that microsynteny synapomorphies often arise from gene family expansions. Conservation of synteny concentrated in specific genomic regions may harbor the genomic underpinnings of the unique aspects of these clades and have played an important role in the evolutionary history of these taxa. Together, these results provide a robust phylogenomic backbone for Cypriniformes. More broadly, our findings highlight the power of microsynteny to resolve recalcitrant phylogenetic nodes where sequence data is uninformative, while also underscoring the critical importance of high-quality reference genomes, as our work also shows that including fragmented assemblies can lead to spurious results. Beyond phylogenomics, our results also provide a functional genomics glimpse into how conserved, clade-specific blocks of co-linear genes (synteny synapomorphies) might contribute to what makes this hyperdiverse clade so unique and evolutionarily successful.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

In line with previous work, we identified six genetic populations: 1) St. Lawrence Estuary, 2) Eastern High Arctic, 3) James Bay, 4) Cumberland Sound, 5) Hudson Bay-Strait Complex and 6) Little and Great Whale Rivers. Demographic history in the deep (up to 1,000,000 years) past revealed all but the Hudson Bay-Strait Complex population declined in effective population sizes following the last glacial period.

In this study, we explore the nature of genomic divergence between two sympatric marine stickleback ecotypes from Atlantic Canada, \"whites\" and \"commons\". Males of each ecotype exhibit distinct nuptial colorations, nesting habits, and parental care strategies. Using population genomic analyses of SNPs and copy number variants (CNVs; deletions and duplications) we show that whites and commons consistently form distinct populations. We uncover genomic differentiation in the white ecotype characteristic of an incipient species, showing extremely low genome-wide differentiation (FST) and very recent divergence (~1 kya). Demographic analysis detected very low levels of ongoing gene flow between populations. Our results and prior genomic studies suggest that reproductive isolation is being maintained between ecotypes despite recent evidence that hybridization in nature does occur. Contrary to other systems, we found many small, but dispersed regions of high differentiation throughout the genome rather than explicitly within chromosomal inversions or the sex chromosomes. On chromosomes VII and XVI, we identified CNVs overlapping genes enriched for olfaction, which may play a role in differences in reproductive strategies between ecotypes. Ultimately, our results demonstrate that genome-wide rather than localized differences can underlie the early stages of divergence, and that this pattern is corroborated by both SNPs and CNVs.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

However, most analyses have focused on short-range interactions (<2 Mb), limiting insight into broader regulatory architecture. In particular, the relationships between topologically associating domains (TADs), sub-TAD loops, long-range cross-TAD interactions, and higher-order chromosomal compartmentalization remain poorly understood. Here, we identify extensive multi-megabase and interchromosomal interactions (metaloops) in T lymphocytes, which organize into larger meta-TAD associations (metadomains). Metaloops bridge distal promoters and regulatory elements of key T cell-specific genes such as Ctla4, Ikzf2, Il2ra, Ets1, Lef1, Runx1, Bach2, Foxo1 and others, and are both shared and cell type-specific across functionally distinct T cell lineages. Reanalysis of published data confirms the reproducibility of these interactions in both mouse and human T cells and their dependence on superenhancers. Genome-wide clustering of metadomains reveals three interchromosomal hubs with distinct epigenomic profiles, including a superenhancer-enriched hub associated with T cell-specific gene activation. By integrating a compendium of new and public T cell epigenomic data, we infer distinct architectural factors associated with short-range loops and long-range metaloops.

Despite considerable research on leaf starch metabolism in Arabidopsis, little is known about the function of AMY3. Starch is composed of two glucose polymers: highly branched amylopectin (70-90%) and largely unbranched amylose (10-30%). Because -amylases are endo-amylases, we predicted that AMY3 might prefer to hydrolyze amylose, in contrast to the exo-amylase {beta}-amylase1 (BAM1), which we predicted would prefer amylopectin. Using iodine spectroscopy, we observed that AMY3 caused the percent amylose of corn starch to decrease, whereas BAM1 caused the percent amylose to increase before a gradual decrease. Enzyme assays revealed that AMY3 has a higher affinity for amylose compared to amylopectin, whereas BAM1 has a higher affinity for amylopectin. Furthermore, we found that the starch in amy3 leaves had twice as much amylose as WT leaves at the end of the day which suggests potential health and industrial applications. We purified the AMY3 CBM region and studied its structure with small-angle X-ray scattering, seeking to understand its role in substrate specificity. The AMY3 CBMs form a unique duplex where two interlocking {beta}-strands connect CBM1 and CBM2. The duplex CBM forms a dimer in solution and can bind amylose and amylopectin. However, AMY3 without the CBMs still prefers amylose, indicating the duplex CBM is not essential for amylose specificity in vitro.

However, observed fluorescence is not always proportional to their molar abundance. Only a fraction of the fusion protein containing the mature fluorescence chromophore is detectable by spectroscopy and there is no generic method for estimating its molar abundance. We developed a fluorescence-independent mass-spectrometry based approach for accurate absolute sub-femtomole quantification of FP-fusions that also estimates the protein faction having fully matured chromophore. The method exploits an isotopically labelled 68 kDa recombinant protein standard containing peptide proxies for 6 prototypical FPs (mCherry, mScarlet-I, mKate2, EGFP, mNeonGreen and Dendra2) and two self-labelling (Halo- and SNAP-) tags. It enables quantification of proteins fused to any of more than 70 FPs or self-labelling tags. It is versatile, robust, precise and can be used broadly for the absolute quantification of fluorescent fusions in in-vivo and in-vitro cellular systems. As case study we combined mass spectrometry with fluorescence spectroscopy to study expression kinetics of FP fusions in cell-free systems. Molar concentrations of the expressed fusion protein, its fraction containing the mature fluorescent chromophore and of the fluorescent protein were integrated into a mathematical model to obtain kinetic rates of translation, chromophore maturation and folding.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Adults with successfully treated COA exhibit significantly higher incidence of hypertension. The objective of this study was to measure differences in the structure and mechanics of proximal and distal aortic tissue from a new, physiologically relevant growing porcine model of COA. This animal model also enabled the evaluation of a cutting-edge serially dilatable stent. Quantitative histologic analysis measured structural changes and the mechanical properties were investigated through uniaxial, shear lap, and peel tests of tissue from sham, control COA, and treated COA animals. Our original hypothesis that proximal aortic tissue from control and treated COA groups would be thicker and have less elastin was false. There were no significant differences in elastin content, collagen content, tissue area, lumen area, or lumen-to-tissue area between groups. Mechanically, distal tissue also exhibited no difference in either uniaxial or shear lap stiffness, failure stress, or failure strain between groups. Distal tissue from the COA control and treated COA groups however, exhibited, a lower circumferential failure peel tension, suggesting interlamellar strength was reduced. When compared with other previously published animal models of COA, a clear distinction was timing - our growing porcine model is the first for which COA was induced and treated at physiologically relevant time points. Our results indicated minimal adverse vascular remodeling in either the COA control or treated COA groups, however, it is unclear if this was due to a lack of severity, if elastinogenesis compensated for damage, or if another unknown mechanism prevented remodeling.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Traditional toxicological evaluations, which predominantly rely on intensive in vitro and in vivo assays, are frequently slow and expensive processes. Here, we introduce a novel application of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), an emerging computational paradigm inspired by the way the human brain works in encoding information, for the efficient classification of chemical compounds as either toxic or non-toxic. Our methodology employs Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) representations of compounds, drawing data from the comprehensive Tox21 dataset. We delineate a pipeline wherein these chemical structures are encoded into high-dimensional binary vectors, which subsequently serve as the foundation for training and classification within the HDC framework. This approach leverages HDC inherent advantages, including its resilience to noise, parallel processing capabilities, and efficacy in identifying intricate patterns. This work demonstrates the viability of HDC as a promising alternative for large-scale toxicity prediction, offering a computationally efficient and scalable solution. This research significantly contributes to the field of cheminformatics by validating HDC potential in chemical property prediction, thereby facilitating accelerated identification of hazardous substances and mitigating the reliance on intensive laboratory experimentations.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

However, this approach traditionally relies on high-resolution co-complex structures obtained by X-ray crystallography, NMR, or cryo-EM, methods that are time-consuming and resource-intensive. Here we show that Chai-1, a publicly available structure prediction tool that accepts user-defined ligands, is able to accurately predict covalent K-Ras(G12C) complexes without using a multiple sequence alignment (MSA). Chai-1 yields pocket-aligned RMSDs <2 [A] for chemically diverse K-Ras(G12C) inhibitors, ranging from ARS-853 to BBO-8520. In addition to the conventional acrylamide-based covalent K-Ras(G12C) inhibitors, Chai-1 with a covalent-bond restraint successfully reproduced the binding poses of covalent K-Ras(G12D) and K-Ras(G12S) inhibitors, while showing limitations in capturing chemical details such as accounting for leaving-groups, bond properties, and stereochemistry. Chai-1 also provides ~40-fold higher throughput than state-of-the-art AlphaFold3 while maintaining comparable pose accuracy. Together, these findings establish Chai-1 as an accessible and computationally efficient tool for covalent protein-ligand co-complex structure prediction, with its covalent-restraint mode offering a unique solution to accelerate covalent drug discovery, especially for challenging targets beyond cysteine.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Recently, we have demonstrated that activation of the EMP program also results in the assembly of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and resistance to immunotherapy in an immunocompetent orthotopic murine model. However, it has yet to be shown whether these findings can be translated to canine carcinomas. Here, we show that in spontaneous canine mammary carcinomas (CMCs), which share similar histopathologic, molecular, and clinical features with human breast cancers, EMP activation is linked to the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells including regulatory T-cells and M2-like macrophages. Additionally, through transcriptomic profiling of CMCs, we identify that the glycoprotein CD109 is associated with EMP-mediated immunosuppression across canine, murine, and human breast cancer models. CD109 has been previously associated with tumorigenicity, but not immunosuppression in cancers of any species. Finally, we identified upregulation of several immunosuppressive paracrine factors across multiple canine carcinomas, including oral squamous cell carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma, and pulmonary carcinoma samples. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the EMP program is associated with immunosuppression in canine carcinomas, with direct translational implications for human breast cancers.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Diet is a modifiable risk factor that can shape tumor biology, potentially affecting gene expression and the tumor microenvironment. Understanding how dietary patterns correlate with molecular signatures in GA may provide insights for preventive and therapeutic strategies. Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional, analytical study included 60 patients diagnosed with gastric adenocarcinoma and treated at the Joao de Barros Barreto University Hospital, Para, Brazil. Structured questionnaires collected sociodemographic, lifestyle (smoking and alcohol), clinical, and dietary data. Dietary patterns were analyzed according to the Brazilian Ministry of Health guidelines. A subset of 16 patients was selected for gene expression profiling to evaluate correlations between dietary exposure and molecular alterations. Results: The patient cohort exhibited a predominance of males (56.7%) and older adults (>60 years), often from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds. Dietary analysis revealed insufficient intake of fruits, vegetables, and legumes, alongside high consumption of ultraprocessed foods, especially sugar-sweetened beverages. Gene expression analysis identified 48 differentially expressed genes between patients with lower (LEDRF) and higher (HEDRF) dietary risk exposure. Six genes with potential biological relevance were highlighted: MAGEA3, IL6, HCAR2, NLRP4, PGA3, and CTCFL. MEFDR patients showed overexpression of MAGEA3, IL6, and HCAR2, associated with cell proliferation, inflammation, and tumor microenvironment remodeling. Discussion: The results suggest that dietary patterns may modulate gene expression and influence the tumor microenvironment in gastric adenocarcinoma. Diets rich in ultraprocessed foods and sugar may promote a pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant microenvironment, while consumption of fruits, vegetables, and bioactive compounds appears protective, potentially regulating epigenetic, metabolic, and immunological pathways. The study underscores the importance of integrated approaches combining nutritional intervention and molecular profiling to better understand GA progression and identify potential therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Collateral sensitivity, where resistance to one drug confers sensitivity to another, could be leveraged to optimize chemotherapy for EWS. Gene expression signatures that predict collateral sensitivity states can be used to guide treatment selection in an evolution-informed manner. We experimentally evolved resistance to first-line EWS chemotherapy in cell lines. Throughout, we measured collateral responses across a panel of anticancer drugs and quantified transcriptomic changes. Collateral drug responses varied across replicate evolutionary trajectories, but convergent states of collateral sensitivity emerged across different replicates at different times. By associating these convergent phenotypes with gene expression patterns, we derived a library of predictive signatures for numerous drugs. These signatures accurately distinguished states of collaterally sensitivity from states of collateral resistance within our dataset and were further validated in an independent EWS cell line. Our findings demonstrate that gene expression signatures can predict collateral sensitivity in EWS, providing a foundation for personalized therapeutic strategies.

Unfortunately, only minimal scientific information on the effects of 6-MN is available. Objective: To determine the extent to which 6-MN produces nicotine-like effects on body temperature, wheel activity and nociception in laboratory rodents. Methods: Middle-aged (starting at Post Natal Day 425) female Wistar rats were evaluated for rectal temperature, voluntary wheel activity, and nociceptive responses (warm water tail-withdrawal) to subcutaneous injection of nicotine (0.0, 0.8 mg/kg) or 6-methyl nicotine (6-MN; 0.0, 0.4, 0.8 mg/kg). Temperature and nociceptive responses to vapor inhalation of 6-MN [0-30 mg/mL in the propylene glycol (PG) vehicle] were assessed. Finally, the self-administration of 6-MN vapor was compared with nicotine vapor self-administration. Results: 6-MN decreased rectal temperature, suppressed wheel activity and induced modest nociceptive effects. The magnitude of the effect of 0.8 mg/kg 6-MN and 0.8 mg/kg nicotine were similar across all three assays. Vapor self-administration of 6-MN and nicotine was likewise comparable at a 10 mg/mL concentration. Conclusion: 6-MN administered by injection or by vapor inhalation produces behavioral and physiological effects that are very similar to those produced by nicotine in rats. It is therefore likely that detrimental health effects of 6-MN will be quite similar to those established for nicotine.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

While cleavage of the {gamma}-ENaC subunit has been implicated in aldosterone-mediated sodium transport, the identity of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-regulated proteases responsible for this process remains uncertain. Here, we investigated the role of kallikrein-1 (encoded by Klk1), a serine protease expressed in the connecting tubule and cortical collecting duct (CNT/CCD), as a mediator of ENaC activation. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we generated a conditional Klk1-floxed allele and established mice with CNT/CCD-specific deletion of Klk1 by crossing with Calb1-Cre (CNT-Klk1-/-). On a low sodium, high potassium diet, CNT-Klk1-/- mice exhibited ~85% less renal kallikrein-1 expression, yet maintained normal serum electrolytes, urinary potassium excretion, and aldosterone responses. Western blot analysis revealed significantly less cleavage of {gamma}-ENaC and -ENaC in CNT-Klk1-/- kidneys, accompanied by more total NCC abundance. Despite impaired ENaC proteolysis, amiloride-sensitive sodium excretion was preserved, indicating intact ENaC function. These findings identify renal kallikrein-1 as a protease that contributes to ENaC subunit processing in vivo. However, the absence of overt sodium or potassium handling defects in CNT-Klk1-/- mice suggests that kallikrein-1 deficiency is not sufficient to disrupt overall ENaC function, likely due to compensatory mechanisms from redundant proteolytic or non-proteolytic pathways. Together, our results refine the role of kallikrein-1 as a modulator, rather than a sole determinant, of ENaC activation and highlight the complexity of aldosterone-dependent sodium transport in the distal nephron.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

The latter exhibits a uniform anthocyanin content, whereas photosensitive eggplants lack anthocyanin accumulation in areas not exposed to light, such as under the calyx, or have lower concentrations in less-exposed areas. In the current research work, genetic analysis of F1 and F2 populations revealed that the non-photosensitive phenotype in eggplants follows an autosomal dominant inheritance with a 3:1 ratio, indicating that the photosensitive trait is regulated by a single dominant gene. To locate and narrow down the position of the gene underlying photosensitivity, an F2 population segregating for photosensitivity and presence of anthocyanins was used for bulked segregant analysis sequencing (BSA-seq), and RNA-seq analysis of bagged photosensitive and non-photosensitive eggplants was performed. As a result, we identified the SmNAC1-like gene as a candidate for fruit photosensitivity trait in the eggplant materials used in this study. In the photo-insensitive eggplants (DH-ECAVI and IVIA-371) two different high-impact mutations were identified leading to light-insensitive and uniform anthocyanin content. The mutation in DH-ECAVI causes a premature stop codon, while in IVIA-371 an indel mutation occurs in the 3'-UTR sequence. No high-impact mutations were found in SmNAC1-like gene in photo-sensitive eggplants.

Despite domestic felids having a high incidence of CKD as they age, no study has fully characterised feline RPTEC lipid droplets in the context of CKD.

Felids (domestic, wildcat) consistently had greater renal lipid content than dogs at all ages studied. Intracytoplasmic lipid extraction with chromatography, fatty acid characterisation and mass spectrometry-based lipidomics revealed unusual presence of a panoply of novel lipids found only in domestic cat: lipids were primarily modified (i.e. less polar) ether-soluble triacylglycerols including monoalkyldiacylglycerols (MADAGs) and other branched-chain fatty acids.

Under conditions of oxygen sufficiency HIF-1 is constitutively produced and degraded. In response to hypoxia, the degradation pathway is inhibited and HIF-1 protein accumulates via mechanisms that are now well understood. Additional signals combine with the oxygen-sensitive protein degradation pathway to modulate the expression and/or activity of HIF-1. In the context of the immune system, HIF-1 can be activated under normoxic conditions by a variety of stimuli, including the pro-inflammatory agonist lipopolysaccharide. Here we use a variety of genetic and pharmacological approaches to reveal that lipopolysaccharide-induced HIF-1 accumulation in primary macrophages is dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase p38. This response is not dependent on modulation of HIF-1 protein stability: instead, it involves the phosphorylation and inactivation of tristetraprolin, an mRNA destabilizing protein that targets Hif1a mRNA for degradation. We previously reported that the glucocorticoid dexamethasone inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced HIF-1 accumulation and metabolic reprograming in primary macrophages. Here we tested and disproved the hypothesis that dexamethasone prevents HIF-1 accumulation by inducing expression of dual specificity phosphatase 1 and thereby inhibiting p38 function. Hence two novel mechanisms critically regulate HIF-1 activation in lipopolysaccharide-treated macrophages: a p38-dependent mechanism that operates at the post-transcriptional level to control Hif1a mRNA expression, and a glucocorticoid-sensitive mechanism that operates at the post-translational level to control HIF-1 protein stability. Combined targeting of these two mechanisms may exert therapeutic effects in contexts where HIF-1 contributes to immune-mediated inflammatory pathology.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Vertical transmission during pregnancy significantly contributes to the urban spread of the disease, even in non-endemic areas. The placental barrier plays a key role in preventing fetal infection, although the molecular mechanisms underlying congenital transmission remain unclear. To identify placental factors associated with transmission, we conducted a transcriptomic study comparing placental tissues from deliveries of congenitally infected (M+B+), exposed but uninfected (M+B-), and unexposed/uninfected (M-B-) newborns. Differential gene expression analysis of transmitting placentas revealed that ENSG00000304767, a novel lncRNA sense intronic to CEMIP was overexpressed as well as CGB5, while CEMIP, CADM3, CADH11 and PRXX1 were underexpressed. In non-transmitting placentas, the long non-coding RNA MIR4300 was overexpressed while CGB5 was underexpressed. These results suggest that cell adhesion and the extracellular matrix integrity are altered in transmitting placentas. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis using the GO library revealed immune-related terms underrepresented in both infected mother groups, and confirmed that extracellular matrix processes, particularly collagen organization and metabolism, constitute important factors in transmission events. Analysis using the Cell Type library showed that extravillous trophoblasts were overrepresented in M+B+, but the opposite in M+B-. In contrast, syncytiotrophoblasts and villous cytotrophoblasts were overrepresented in non-transmitting vs. control cases. Immune-related placental cell types were consistently reduced in both M+ groups when compared to controls. The co-expression network analysis confirmed that the placental signaling and structural integrity were compromised in transmitting cases. ENPP1 and SLC16A10 emerged as hub genes with pivotal roles in the pathways altered during congenital infection. These findings highlight key placental transcriptional alterations linked to congenital T. cruzi transmission and provide insight into potential molecular mechanisms of fetal protection or susceptibility.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

G.; Ferreira, I. A.; Tirel, Q.; Barriga, E. H.", "abstract": "Epimorphic regeneration encompasses several stages, such as wound healing, formation of a regenerative bud and regenerative outgrowth. The signatures that define each stage have been well studied, yet little is known about the mechanisms that coordinate cell state transitions across regenerative stages. Here, we show that stiffening of wounded epithelial tissues is essential for the formation of a prospective regenerative bud and, in turn, for the transition from wound healing to bud formation. Mechanistically, to detect prospective bud stiffening, cells use a mechanosensitive cascade involving Piezo1-dependent Yap1 activation. We also determined that this cascade is required for the acquisition of a transcriptional profile that endows bud cells with regenerative competence. Notably, the activation of this Piezo1-Yap1 mechanosensitive cascade in nonregenerative contexts is sufficient to induce the formation of competent bud-like structures, which are sufficient to drive de novo regeneration in these otherwise incompetent tissues. Taken together, our results reveal a mechanical state at the boundary between wound healing and regenerative bud formation, which is essential for synchronizing the transition between these pivotal stages of regeneration. Broadly, these findings support the general idea that the physical properties of tissues integrate with molecular frameworks to actuate cell state transitions during morphogenesis", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

This genotype emerged in France in spring 2022 through reassortment between a gull-adapted low-pathogenicity virus and HPAIV H5N1. Phylogeographic and spatiotemporal analyses show that transmission into German breeding colonies of black-headed gulls (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common terns (Sterna hirundo) involved multiple independent incursions, likely via black-headed gulls returning from wintering grounds in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. It spilled over into common terns, which breed in shared colonies with black-headed gulls, and led to high adult mortality in both species in 2023 (at least 8,137 black-headed gulls and 614 common terns; >3% of the breeding population), followed by significant breeding pair declines in 2024 (-15.9% in black-headed gulls, -5.8% in common terns). Increased immunity, at least in common terns, may have contributed to the apparent fade-out of genotype euBB. These findings highlight how integrating ornithological, epidemiological, and virological data can aid our understanding of viral transmission routes and population-level impacts, while also stressing that HPAIV should be added to the growing list of pressures on seabirds, a group that was already the most threatened among all bird taxa globally.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Current theory suggests that dry soils act as CH4 sinks, with higher soil carbon (C) content enhancing oxidation. To test this, we measured CH4 fluxes in 12 field plots with increasing C content in Israel's Negev Desert over three summer and three winter months using automated chambers. We hypothesized that well-aerated soils would oxidize CH4, and the oxidation rate will increase with more organic matter. Contrary to our hypothesis, CH4 was emitted ~75% of the time, with average effluxes of 0.222 {+/-} 0.007 nmol m-2s-1 in summer and 0.081 {+/-} 0.004 in winter. We propose that CH4 emissions were driven by abiotic processes related to solar radiation, not microbial activity. A shading experiment reduced CH4 efflux by 51%, supporting this idea.

Granivores, like ants, cause significant seed loss but can also have a positive impact. Most studies on this topic examine seed consumption in isolation, failing to consider how the presence of other seeds can influence granivory. However, in nature, seeds of different species share space, which can lead to \"associational susceptibility\" or \"resistance\" effects. These effects depend on ant preferences for both the focal and neighboring species. Preferred seeds can act as a \"magnet,\" attracting ants and increasing the predation of nearby seeds. Conversely, less preferred seeds can have a \"deterrent\" effect. The magnitude of these associative effects may also depend on the preference of the focal seed itself: more desirable seeds will be less affected by neighboring seeds than less preferred ones. This study examined how the presence of heterospecific seeds affects ant seed removal in 28 plant species. We found that preferred seeds experienced a greater reduction in removal probability in the presence of other species. Additionally, plant population densities were positively correlated with the overall associative effect of neighboring seeds. This is the first study to report these indirect interactions between seeds affecting ant removal. Our results suggest that the impact of ants is a complex interaction of predation and dispersal, and their net effect on plant populations can be positive, even though seed removal is often considered a negative interaction.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

However, the global comparability of these eDNA datasets remains ambiguous due heterogeneous sampling protocols and bioinformatic workflows across studies, particularly regarding the robustness of their conclusions on biodiversity assessments. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 58 riverine fish eDNA metabarcoding datasets, covering 1,818 sampling sites worldwide, to evaluate the robustness of eDNA-derived biodiversity patterns. We found that species richness estimates and metrics of community structure derived under a common bioinformatic workflow were overall consistent with those of original analyses, despite the relatively high variability in bioinformatic analyses in the respective original studies. Contrastingly, congruence of species identity varied more extensively across datasets, mostly reflecting different completeness and regional relevance of reference databases. Restricting taxonomic assignment to basin-specific species pools improved species identification accuracy, while datasets lacking publicly accessible or well-curated reference data were more prone to mismatches. Year of sampling had a positive effect on taxonomic congruence, such that more recent studies showed increased robustness, also reflecting improved reference database coverage and enhanced species-level identification over time and overall method congruence in more recent years. Overall, the suitability and potential of eDNA for global biodiversity monitoring is corroborating overall robust biodiversity estimates, irrespective of the bioinformatic approaches.

Response diversity is expected to drive ecological stability since a wider variety of responses to one or more environmental factors should stabilise fluctuations of ecosystem functions. However, uptake of empirical response diversity research has been slow. Here we assess current thinking around response diversity by conducting a targeted expert survey of response diversity researchers. Our survey revealed that one barrier to a unified research agenda on response diversity is the lack of agreement among respondents on the definition of response diversity, and to which dimension(s) of ecological stability response diversity might relate. When asked to select the temporal, spatial, and biological scales at which response diversity may be most relevant for ecological stability, respondents chose a wide range of scales indicating differences in how experts view response diversity's stabilising effect. Respondents considered studies incorporating both biotic interactions and abiotic environmental responses to be especially challenging, as were those thinking about responses to multiple environmental changes simultaneously. Moreover, respondents thought inconsistencies in the definitions of, and methods for measuring, response diversity were a major challenge facing the field. Despite these barriers, the survey revealed a desire for globally coordinated research efforts on response diversity in the form of syntheses, workshops, and distributed experiments, but that a standardised response diversity metric across diverse use-cases could be too restrictive. Our findings suggest we can shift response diversity from a loose collection of conceptual studies and inconsistent empirical applications towards a quantitative and coordinated research programme mechanistically linking biodiversity and ecological stability. As such, we are launching the Response Diversity Network---a research community interested in the science and application of response diversity---whose activities we hope will benefit both individual studies of response diversity and globally coordinated research efforts.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Yet, previous studies linking environmental conditions with plant growth form have overlooked that different growth form types arose through distinct evolutionary pathways. For instance, some woody angiosperm lineages evolved woodiness from a herbaceous ancestor, whereas others have retained their woodiness throughout evolutionary history. The Canary Islands are a global hotspot of insular woodiness (woodiness trait evolved on the islands from herbaceous colonisers), raising the question of whether insular woody species generally occur in different environmental conditions than other growth forms on the islands. Here, we use a novel pipeline to extract, filter, and analyse publicly available spatial data to identify the environmental correlates of plant growth forms in the angiosperm flora of the Canary Islands, accounting for their distinct evolutionary histories as well as differences in life span. To assess whether and how five growth forms (annual herbaceous, perennial herbaceous, ancestral woodiness, derived woodiness, and insular woodiness) differ in environmental niche space, we applied a phylogenetic principal component analysis to a dataset of ~1,000 native Canary Island angiosperm species. We show the herbaceous and woody growth forms have an unexpectedly high overlap in niche space. The subtle differences are explained mostly by climatic seasonality (in both temperature and precipitation) and topographic complexity. We use phylogenetic ANOVAs to identify significant pairwise differences between the five growth forms, and find significant differentiation between five environmental variables, with differences between a combined woody and a combined herbaceous niche, and between the different evolutionary histories across the woody growth forms. Through our approach, the collection and analysis of publicly available spatial and environmental data can be automated, facilitating research into the environmental niche.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify the mitochondrial citrate carrier SLC25A1 as a determinant of ICI responsiveness through a dual regulation of type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling and of PD-L1 expression. SLC25A1 promotes a mitochondrial-to-nuclear retrograde signaling via cytosolic accumulation of mitochondrial DNA, activation of the cGAS-STAT1 axis, and establishment of a virus mimicry state that enhances the IFN-I response. This activation is enriched in cancer stem cell populations, linking SLC25A1 to immune evasion and tumor progression. Moreover, SLC25A1 also regulates PD-L1 protein levels through a newly identified fumarate-Keap1-PD-L1 axis, whereby fumarate destabilizes Keap1, leading to PD-L1 up-regulation. In vivo, tumors expressing high levels of SLC25A1 exhibit an inflammatory microenvironment and increased sensitivity to PD-L1 blockade, but accelerated growth in the absence of anti-PD-L1 treatment. These findings position SLC25A1 as a novel regulator of mitochondrial-driven immune signaling and PD-L1 stability, and suggest that SLC25A1 exploits PD-L1 signaling to evade immune surveillance, while at the same time creating an intrinsic tumor vulnerability to checkpoint blockade. Thus, SLC25A1 may serve both as a biomarker of response and as a target to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Our laboratory has shown that the proton-gated cation channel, acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1a), is essential for the development of chronic hypoxia (CH)-induced PH in rodents. Importantly, ASIC1a activation occurs without changes in total ASIC1a levels but reflects a hypoxia-dependent redistribution to the plasma membrane in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). In neurons, mitochondrial-localized ASIC1a (mtASIC1a) contributes to oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{psi}m) depolarization and apoptosis. Although mtASIC1a has not been described in vascular cells, its role in PASMCs may be relevant to mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis resistance in PH. We hypothesize that mtASIC1a is a crucial regulator of PASMC mitochondrial homeostasis, and its loss following CH promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis resistance. Consistent with this, mtASIC1a localization was decreased in PASMCs and intrapulmonary arteries from CH rats compared to controls. Functionally, PASMCs from CH rats or Asic1a knockout mice exhibited {Delta}{psi}m hyperpolarization, elevated mitochondrial Ca2+; and superoxide, impaired mitophagy, and reduced cleaved caspase-3. Transmission electron microscopy revealed mitochondrial morphological changes, including increased size and circularity, decreased aspect ratio, and reduced mitochondrial number per cell, while fusion/fission proteins remained largely unchanged. Lentiviral restoration of mtASIC1a prevented {Delta}{psi}m hyperpolarization and restored caspase-3 cleavage. These findings identify mtASIC1a as a novel regulator of mitochondrial function in PASMCs, where its loss following CH promotes {Delta}{psi}m hyperpolarization, impaired mitophagy, and resistance to apoptosis.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

In this study, we examined, for the first time, the anti-osteoclastogenic property of ILC3 in vitro. We observed that ILC3 inhibits RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis in a cell ratio-dependent manner. We further employed an ovariectomized (ovx) mouse model, which mimics postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), to investigate the role of ILC3 in inflammatory bone loss. Notably, our in vivo data unequivocally validate that the ovx mice have a markedly lower frequency of ILC3 in the bone marrow (BM). Furthermore, the temporal-kinetic analysis revealed that alterations in ILC3 cell dynamics and function in the BM are associated with the development and progression of inflammatory bone loss in PMO. Additionally, our in vivo results demonstrate that dysbiosis in PMO drives significant alterations in the frequency of ILC3 subsets by promoting the expansion of IL-17-producing Nkp46- ILC3 and inhibiting the development of IL-22-producing Nkp46+ ILC3. Moreover, T-bet+ ILC3s are significantly increased in ovariectomized (ovx) mice.

Here, we identify transcription factor Spalt-related (Salr), previously implicated in organogenesis, as a negative regulator of growth and lipid storage. In the Drosophila fat body Salr activates catabolic gene expression and restricts mTORC1-mediated cell growth. The genomic binding of Salr overlaps extensively with that of FoxO and similar convergence is observed between their mammalian homologs SALL1 and FOXO1. Both Salr and FoxO are activated upon fasting but respond to distinct cues: while FoxO displays transient activation and is responsive to AKT inhibition, Salr is activated in a slow and sustained manner through the integrated stress response. Once activated, Salr counters nuclear localization of FoxO. Together, Salr and FoxO are converging transcriptional activators of catabolism during nutrient stress.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Myotonia results from mis-regulated splicing of chloride channel 1 (ClC-1), leading to loss of channel function and runs of involuntary action potentials in muscle fibers. Heralding the onset of weakness, myotonia is often the first symptom of DM1, and raising the possibility that muscle hyperexcitability promotes the subsequent development of myopathy. We used genome editing to test this possibility by deleting the alternatively spliced and frameshift inducing ClC-1 exon 7a (E7a) in the Mbnl1 knockout model of DM1. Although several ClC-1 exons exhibit mis-regulated splicing in DM1, deletion of this single cryptic exon was sufficient to restore ClC-1 function and eliminate myotonia systemically and permanently. As determined by long-read sequencing, deletion of E7a reduced the frequency of other splicing defects in ClC-1 transcripts, likely as a passive consequence of restoring reading frame and nonsense surveillance. Furthermore, we observed significantly improved muscle force generation, fiber-type distribution, and histology, and partial restoration of the muscle transcriptome, including differential gene expression and alternative splicing, in non-myotonic Mbnl1 knockout mice. These results suggest that E7a inclusion is a lynchpin splice event that contributes to skeletal myopathy, highlighting myotonia as a therapeutic target and an outcome of interest in DM1.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

C.; Strijdom, H.; Huang, Y.; Weng, J.; Xu, S.", "abstract": "Objective:The progression of cardiovascular disease shows significant sexual dimorphism: although females generally develop the disease later in life, they exhibit a higher age-related incidence than males. Despite this clinical pattern, preclinical studies often overlook both sexes in their design, and existing research on sex-specific atherosclerosis in mice remains inconsistent. This study was designed to assess the influence of sex on atherosclerosis using two widely used atherosusceptible mouse models - Apoe-/- and Ldlr-/- mice. Approach and Results:To investigate the influence of sex on atherogenesis, we conducted a 20-week study using both male and female Apoe?/? and Ldlr?/? mice. The mice were fed an atherogenic ALMN diet (40% trans-fat, 2% cholesterol, 22% fructose) to promote plaque development. We performed comprehensive analyses of: (1) systemic metabolic parameters (lipid profile, glucose metabolism); (2) atherosclerotic burden (en face and aortic sinus plaque area); and (3) plaque composition (necrotic core size, collagen content, macrophage infiltration). In both models, male mice showed higher lipid levels, worse glucose tolerance, and reduced insulin sensitivity compared to females. Apoe-/- mice showed minimal sex differences in atherosclerosis with a trend toward increased plaque size in females. Plaque stability markers - including collagen content, necrotic core size, and macrophage infiltration - did not differ significantly between sexes. In contrast, Ldlr-/- males exhibited greater en face plaque burden than females, yet plaque stability remained similar across sexes. Conclusion: Comparative analysis of two widely used murine atherosclerosis models revealed genotype-dependent sexual dimorphism. Female Apoe-/- mice showed a non-significant trend toward larger plaque areas than males, whereas male Ldlr-/- mice developed significantly larger en face atherosclerotic plaques than females. By evaluating plaque area and composition across these models, our findings underscore the importance of including both sexes in atherosclerosis studies, in accordance with guidelines from the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Sideways locomotion is a defining feature of true crabs (Brachyura) and may have contributed to their ecological success. Yet, the evolutionary origin of this unique behavior remains unknown.

Our behavioral analysis of 50 live crab species indicates that crab locomotion can be separated into two distinct types, sideways and forward locomotion, with no intermediates. The phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed a single origin of sideways locomotion, with multiple independent reversions to forward locomotion in ecologically specialized groups. The species richness data show that the lineage in which sideways locomotion originated is far more diverse than its nearest outgroups. These results suggest that sideways locomotion acted as a key innovation, potentially promoting adaptive radiation by enabling true crabs to exploit a wide range of ecological niches.

Hemoglobins and myoglobins of jawed vertebrates are among the most well-studied proteins in the context of structure-function relationships and evolution after gene duplication. However, these studies have primarily focused on bony vertebrates, and research on globin gene evolution in cartilaginous fish has been limited by a lack of genomic resources. In this study, we leverage newly available cartilaginous fish genomes to investigate globin gene family evolution across skates, rays, sharks, and sawfish. We found that, when present, most globin genes are in a single copy, with androglobin, globin-Y, and myoglobin present in all cartilaginous fish, while the two globin-X genes were differentially retained between the Holocephali and sharks, skates, and rays. Neuroglobin appears to have been lost at the common ancestor of all cartilaginous fish. The - and {beta}-globin gene subfamilies underwent independent expansions in different lineages of cartilaginous fish. Most cartilaginous fish globins have conserved synteny with other jawed vertebrates except myoglobin. Additionally, NPRL3, which directly flanks the hemoglobin clusters of other jawed and jawless vertebrates and regulates hemoglobin gene expression, is on a separate chromosome from the hemoglobin clusters of cartilaginous fish. When we examined globin gene expression patterns across cartilaginous fish tissues and developmental stages, we found that most globins are expressed as expected compared to other jawed vertebrates. However, hemoglobin paralogs are more widely expressed in embryonic tissues compared to later-stage tissues in cases where many copies exist.

However, the potential risk of uncontrolled spread impedes some applications of gene drive. Daisy chain gene drives have received much attention as a potential approach to overcome this problem. They potentially allow the efficient spread of drive elements in a target population, but are ultimately self-limiting. This is achieved by splitting a normal gene drive system into multiple dependent drive elements, where each element can bias the inheritance of another, except one non-driving element. With the successive loss of each chain link, the spread of transgenic elements will slow down and eventually stop. Here, we use modelling to assess the population dynamics of daisy chain drives in both panmictic and continuous space models, focusing on suppression systems. We find that achieving population elimination through a single release of daisy chain gene drives is possible but difficult, with relatively high requirements for drive performance and release size. These effects are substantially amplified in spatial models. We also constructed two configurations of daisy chain gene drives in Drosophila melanogaster as a proof-of-principle. One is a rescue drive for population modification, and the other aims for population suppression by targeting a haplosufficient female fertility gene. These drives all functioned within expectations at moderate efficiency in individual crosses. However, the drive design failed to spread in cage populations because of higher than expected fitness costs. Overall, our study demonstrates that daisy chain systems may be promising candidates for both modification and suppression, but challenges remain in both construction and potential deployment in large regions.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

These RF-pulses, which may require parallel transmit capability, typically take several 10s of milliseconds, prolonging the echo time (TE) of the imaging sequence. Conversely, slice selection using ZOnally-magnified Oblique Multi-slice (ZOOM) (i.e. tilting the excitation relative to the refocusing RF-pulse) is an alternative for reducing FOV while shortening TE. We hypothesized that ZOOM, with appropriate choices for the RF-pulse tilt angle and thickness, can be reliably used as an alternative to ZOOMit for cardiac Diffusion Tensor Imaging (cDTI). Methods: We scanned phantoms using full FOV and ZOOM with various parameters chosen from a 2-dimensional grid of angles and thicknesses. We identified a subset of 5 ZOOM parameters for in vivo cDTI experiments. We performed cDTI on healthy volunteers on a Siemens Prisma (6 subjects) and a Connectom (6 subjects) MR system using the 5 identified ZOOM settings, as well as ZOOMit (Prisma only) and no ZOOM (Connectom only).

Here, we establish an in vitro colon organoid platform to dissect bile salt driven epithelial microbe dynamics at cellular resolution. Using this system, we found that bile salts markedly modulated colonization of native Escherichia coli (EcAZ-2) and a BSH-expressing strain (EcAZ-2LsBSH) in healthy versus tumor murine organoids. Under bile salt exposure, EcAZ-2LsBSH preferentially colonized tumor organoids, though overall colonization was lower than that of the non-BSH strain. Beyond effects on bacterial colonization, bile salts also directly activated host signaling pathways. In presence of bile salts, EcAZ-2LsBSH significantly enhanced activation of bile acid receptors such as farnesoid X receptor (FXR) by 2-fold in healthy organoids.

Functional knockdown experiments identified the up-regulated B3GNT2 enzyme as a potential effector of nociceptor sensitization. In summary, we present a high-resolution proteomic resource linking molecular identity to function, enabling the discovery of novel mechanisms underlying somatic sensation and pain sensitization.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

In this study, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning (SSL) framework inspired by neurophysiological reactivity. Our approach models healthy EEG transitions between ocular states by predicting an EEG-derived feature under eyes-open conditions, using features from eyes-closed recordings. The residual between observed and predicted values quantifies deviations from normative brain dynamics and serves as a candidate biomarker. To improve clinical relevance, we propose two optimisation strategies that promote residuals predictive of pathology. We evaluated the framework using healthy cohorts (LEMON, Dortmund Vital) for self-supervised training, and the AI-Mind cohort for downstream prediction of plasma p-tau217 levels, a proxy for cognitive pathology. Despite extensive hyperparameter optimisation, predictive performance remained poor across all methods, including baseline models, suggesting limitations in the downstream proxy or input signal. Nonetheless, our approach provides a transparent methodology for transition-based EEG biomarker discovery grounded in self-supervised learning.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "LRIT3 is a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) protein that is expressed in the retina, and its absence causes complete congenital stationary night blindness (cCSNB), a genetically diverse disorder characterized by impaired low-light vision, myopia, and nystagmus. LRIT3 is expressed in rod and cone photoreceptors, and it trans-synaptically organizes the assembly of the glutamate signaling complex, the signalplex, on depolarizing bipolar cells (DBCs). LRIT3 is a single-pass membrane protein with extracellular LRR, IG, and FN3 domains. The mechanism by which LRIT3 controls postsynaptic receptor organization remains unknown. We address this by using rAAV to express deletion constructs in LRIT3 knockout retinas and examining LRIT3 trafficking, as well as the structural and functional recovery of the signalplex in DBCs. We show the LRR domain is required for trafficking LRIT3 to the synapse in cones, but not rod photoreceptors, although it is needed for reassembly and function of the rod BC signalplex. Neither the IG nor the FN3 domain is needed for synaptic localization of LRIT3. However, the IG domain is required for the localization of TRPM1 to the signalplex and thus function. The FN3 domain is not necessary for either DBC signalplex assembly or function. Our data demonstrates that the LRR and IG domains of LRIT3 are crucial for TRPM1 localization and retinal function, with the LRR domain playing a key role in the differential function of LRIT3 at rod and cone synapses. Notably, our results show that restoring Nyctalopin localization to the DBC signalplex alone is insufficient to restore TRPM1 expression. Based on our findings, we propose a model in which the LRR domain trans-synaptically binds with Nyctalopin, while the IG domain interacts with TRPM1.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Dreams have been proposed to have evolved as offline mental simulations able to warn against impending threats from the environment, such as predators. To assess how the roles of prey and predator interact with sleep and dreaming, we used a first-person shooter game as a proxy for predator-prey confrontations. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and electrocardiographic (ECG) signals were recorded from 30 human adults paired and simultaneously recorded while 1) playing a video game round against each other, in which one participant was armed with a gun and the other was not, 2) taking a nap, 3) reporting dreams and/or thoughts, and 4) playing another round with the same gun assignment. We found that the participants in the prey role were highly affected by sleep and dreaming. Their score gains were positively correlated with slow wave activity during the nap, with how much the dreams were related to the game, and with heart rate variability during the first round. In contrast, no significant correlations were found for participants in the predator role. The results suggest that slow wave activity and game-related dream content during sleep improve the post-sleep performance of individuals under stressful, prey-like situations.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

To demonstrate this, we adopt a computational model that autonomously learns to store information in memory and retrieve it to solve a variety of tasks. In memory tasks, the model develops associations and categorical representations akin to concept cells. In navigation tasks, the model forms representations of the spatial structure, performs geometric computations, and even learns representations of unique events similar to recently discovered barcodes. Our model predicts that the hippocampus represents any task-relevant variable, if the animal learns the task, suggesting that space is not special for the hippocampus.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

We previously found that chronic buprenorphine treatment decreases several relapse-related behaviors in rats. Here, we tested whether chronic buprenorphine decreases the time-dependent increase (incubation) in heroin seeking during abstinence. We also used the activity marker Fos to test whether buprenorphine inhibition of incubation of heroin seeking is associated with decreased activation of cortical and striatal regions. Methods: We trained Oprm1-Cre rats and their wild-type littermates to self-administer heroin for 12 days (6 h/day). On abstinence Day 1, we tested for heroin seeking under extinction conditions. On Day 14, we implanted osmotic minipumps containing saline or buprenorphine (6 mg/kg/day). On abstinence Days 21-22, we tested the rats (or not tested, baseline condition) for incubation of heroin seeking, after which brains were collected for Fos immunohistochemistry. Results: Oprm1-Cre rats did not differ from wild-type littermates in heroin self-administration or non-incubated heroin seeking on abstinence Day 1. In both genotypes, chronic buprenorphine decreased incubated heroin seeking on Days 21-22. Buprenorphine also decreased incubation-related neuronal activation in several cortical areas (anterior cingulate and dorsal peduncular, but not prelimbic, infralimbic, or orbitofrontal cortex) and striatal areas (dorsolateral and dorsomedial striosomes and nucleus accumbens core, but not shell). Conclusions: Chronic buprenorphine decreased incubation of heroin seeking, supporting the predictive validity of the rat model. This effect was associated with decreased neuronal activity in specific subregions of the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Dietary habits have dramatically altered over recent decades, yet the impact of simplified carbohydrate intake on the gut microbiome's complexity and function remains poorly understood. This study investigates how the variety of dietary carbohydrates - not just their amount - shapes gut microbial diversity and resilience in C57BL/6 mice. Over eight weeks, mice consumed diets varying in carbohydrate complexity but matched for total carbohydrate content. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we found that reduced carbohydrate diversity led to significant declines in microbial diversity and taxonomic redundancy among important bacterial groups, such as unclassified Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Muribaculaceae, despite no immediate changes in host physiology. Concurrently, Akkermansia increased under low-complexity diets, suggesting a shift toward mucin degradation when complex polysaccharides are scarce. These changes indicate that loss of carbohydrate complexity narrows microbial niches, potentially disrupting metabolic interactions and functional stability of the gut ecosystem. Given the widespread adoption of processed, low-fiber diets in modern societies, these findings emphasize the importance of macronutrient complexity in maintaining gut microbial health. While short-term host effects were minimal, the microbial shifts observed could presage long-term consequences for gut resilience and disease susceptibility. This study underscores the need to consider carbohydrate diversity in dietary recommendations and microbial ecology research to safeguard gut health in the face of global dietary simplification.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Such a dataset is hereby used, not as a source of DNA sequences but rather as the handiest and presently most exhaustive checklist matrix of our current taxonomical notions. In the mathematical 'zero assumption' of an equal opportunity chance for each taxon throughout a parallel evolution, a 'perfectly even' community featuring those values would display today, within each of the 196 phyla, the mean values that would result by dividing the actual observed ones by the number of phyla. Such a virtual assemblage would therefore have the following numbers per phylum in each of them: 2.76 classes, 9.51 orders, 24.98 families, 117.92 genera, and 547.12 species. The deltas between these set-point null hypothesis values and the truly observed and described numbers for each lineage member featured by the database (numbers of species per genus, genera per family, families per order, orders per class, and classes per phylum) can reveal how much, and in which lineages, their evolution differed from each of those mere ranks' means. The comparison among the actual data also allows one to answer a series of questions: 1) What is the actually occurred uneven dynamics of evolutionary differentiation across each lineage?; 2) Which taxa are, at present, the 'winners' of the evolutionary race?, And, have they always led the run, or when did they overtake their formerly faster competitors? 3) Are there chronological bottlenecks that violate the assumption of either a constant or of a progressive speed of evolution (i.e. is speciation to each deeper, and more 'modern' rank, consistently faster than its former step, or is there evidence of evolutionary congestion 'jams'?); 4) which past step turns out to have been the most determinant to shape the modern assemblages? Which ones, among the taxa dominating today's diversity, have risen up just recently (e.g. by a massive radiation from genera), and which ones had instead started or accomplished the critical expansion that still keeps them as leaders, in remote times (e.g. by class or order radiations?; 5) Which patterns characterize in this respect the lineages of the most relevant bacterial agents in food, soil, industrial, clinical and environmental microbiology?

This method supplies evidence for at least three classes of intra-Golgi vesicles with different cargo compositions. Consistent with our previously published data, one class of vesicles mediates a late pathway of intra-Golgi recycling with the aid of the AP-1 and Ent5 clathrin adaptors, and a second class of vesicles mediates an early pathway of intra-Golgi recycling with the aid of the COPI vesicle coat.

One group of organelles supported by endosomes are lysosome related organelles (LROs) - which perform specialized functions using endocytosed or recycled materials from endosomes. LROs include melanosomes, lytic granules, platelet dense granules, lamellar bodies, and more. Individuals with endosome trafficking disorders commonly present with oculocutaneous albinism due to insufficient trafficking to - and maturation of - melanosomes. While the loss of pigment is an easily identifiable phenotype, mutations in endosome trafficking can also cause multi-organ system symptoms due to more broad disruption of LROs. Different endosome trafficking mutations impact LRO maturation at different degrees of severity and can impact a subset or all LROs leading to a wide range of symptomologies. Endosome trafficking disorders can present with oculocutaneous albinism (caused by mutated melanosomes), blood diathesis (caused by mutated platelet dense granules), pulmonary fibrosis (caused by mutated lamellar bodies), or chronic inflammation and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (caused by mutated lytic granules), as well as other symptoms. The shared inflammatory patterns of Hermansky-Pudlak Syndrome (HPS) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) are well studied. However, impacts of this shared gastrointestinal inflammation on the gut microbiome remain unexplored. Using a spontaneously identified mutant family of threespine stickleback fish, we characterize changes in LROs and symptoms of oculocutaneous albinism. We further demonstrate that the shared gastrointestinal phenotypes of HPS and IBD extend to the gut microbiome showing similar shifts in microbial communities consistent with IBD. We argue endosome trafficking models should be explored as models to study the gut microbiome in addition to inflammatory phenotypes in IBD, and importantly, be used to test microbial/dietary interventions for both IBD and endosome trafficking disorders.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

We examined the effects of a mixture of 4 PFAS commonly detected in humans, including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA, on blood pressure, salt sensitivity, and renal injury in 129S6 mice. Exposure to a lower dose for 3 weeks produced plasma PFAS levels in mice resembling occupational and regional environmental exposures; while a upper dose achieved levels similar to PFAS production workers. PFAS induced dose-dependent pressor effects in male but not female mice on a 0.4% low salt diet. During 4% high salt feeding, PFAS induced greater salt-sensitive hypertension in male mice, accompanied by glomerulopathy, interstitial fibrosis, and a trend towards increased albuminuria. Pressor effects were independent of plasma norepinephrine. Single-cell RNA sequencing of kidneys revealed most transcriptional changes in proximal tubule, thick ascending limb, and collecting duct, with enrichment of pathways in cholesterol synthesis, mitochondria respiration, ATP production, and transmembrane transporter activity. PFAS markedly increased the mRNA and protein of the pore-forming  subunit of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), with no change in {beta}ENaC and a slight reduction in {gamma}ENaC protein. Elevated ENaC coincided with a 30% decrease in Nedd4-2 phosphorylation (Ser448), suggesting reduced ENaC ubiquitination and degradation. However, protein expression of 1 Na+-K+-ATPase and serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) as well as SGK1 phosphorylation (Ser78) were unaltered. Amiloride abolished salt-induced hypertension in lower-dose mice but only partially corrected hypertension in the upper dose group.

These distributed signals formed ensembles with consistent and anatomically structured patterns of activity, both within subregions and across multiple connected brain areas. By combining TRAP2-based activity tagging with acute whole-brain c-Fos staining, we identified morphine- and withdrawal-activated ensembles and found that they are largely non-overlapping at the single-cell level, even within the same brain region. Integration with existing spatial transcriptomics datasets identified molecular markers for these state-specific ensembles in key brain areas such as the nucleus of accumbens, amygdala and ventral tegmental areas.

However, D135N mutation additionally reduced binding to GluN2B and prevented persistence of co-condensation with GluN2B. Similar as with the T286A mutant, GluN2B binding of the D135N mutant could be partially rescued by AS283, an inhibitor that directly enhances GluN2B binding. This partial effect on GluN2B binding has to be taken into account when using D135N to distinguish between enzymatic versus structural functions of CaMKII. Nonetheless, as discussed here, the D135N mutant indeed supports a structural rather than enzymatic CaMKII function in LTP induction.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

J.; Arnason, T.; Boudreau, J.", "abstract": "Background: At diagnosis, ~80% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) have metastasized. Relapse is thus common even among patients that undergo surgical resection, the only curative option. PDAC progresses rapidly, and existing immunotherapies have been ineffective. We hypothesized that natural killer (NK) cell immunotherapies could be effective against PDAC because they recognize conserved and heterogeneous features associated with cellular stress and transformation, and can seek out metastases distal to the primary tumour site. Here, we aim to define the key features of NK cells as effective agents for PDAC immunotherapy. Methods: We used TCGA PDAC Firehose data and flow cytometry to predict and measure the most common activating or inhibitory ligands available on PDAC for NK cell activation. To ascertain how the tumour might alter expression of these ligands during treatment, inflammation or immune pressure, we measured expression of NK ligands at rest, or after exposure to immune cells or inflammation. To test and rank the functional importance of these dynamic ligands in the recognition, killing and control of PDAC< we used co-culture, antibody-blocking and an NK-competent humanized mouse model. Results: Leveraging the known sequential acquisition of mutations as a surrogate for disease progression, we observed a progressive loss of transcript expression for activating NK cell ligands and chemoattractants. Exposure of PDAC to NK cells or IFN-{gamma}, an inflammatory stimulus, drove dynamic changes in expression of both activating and inhibitory ligands. In vitro co-culture assays revealed a redundancy in the activating receptors engaged in NK:PDAC interactions, but that HLA-KIR signalling dominantly interrupted anti-PDAC activity. In NK-competent humanized mice, adoptively transferred, unselected, unmodified NK cells slowed tumour growth in a dose-dependent manner, but NK cells selected to avoid HLA I-driven inhibition were the most competent effectors for PDAC control. Conclusions: Although there is redundancy among activating ligand:receptor pairs for recognizing PDAC tumours, but interactions between KIR and HLA define the extent to which anti-tumour activity can proceed. During tumour progression, and in response to immunotherapy. NK:tumour interactions drive upregulation of HLA I molecules. Thus, educated NK cells from HLA I-disparate donors may be the most effective allogeneic NK immunotherapy for PDAC.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Previously, we discovered that the first adaptations in a porcine wound model were rugose small-colony variants (RSCVs) caused by mutations in the wsp operon. These mutants overproduce Pel and Psl biofilm exopolysaccharides that improve defense against host responses. To identify other mechanisms of host adaptation that lead to hyperbiofilm phenotypes, we created a mutant with an activated wsp pathway but unable to produce these exopolysaccharides. Porcine wounds were infected with this mutant and biopsies were sampled at days 7, 14 and 35. Small colony variants were isolated from the wound, and whole genome sequencing revealed these variants had acquired mutations in genes in lipopolysaccharide and type IV pili biosynthesis, with wzy and pilU genes being most commonly targeted. pilU mutants were associated with a hyperbiofilm phenotype that outcompeted the parental strain, and wzy mutants were associated with a hyperbiofilm phenotype and increased tolerance to host antimicrobial products. We further identified that several variants had acquired large genome deletions that spanned up to 320 consecutive genes and other variants with high copy numbers of Pf6 filamentous phage. Together our results suggest that the hyperbiofilm phenotype is adaptive in chronic infections and that P. aeruginosa has redundant and diverse pathways to generate this phenotype.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

K. pneumoniae has two pathotypes, classical (cKp) and hypervirulent (hvKp). CKp typically cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals in healthcare settings and often are multi-drug resistant. HvKp can be community acquired and cause high-mortality infections in immunocompetent individuals. Concerningly, antibiotic-resistant cKp strains with hypervirulence-associated genes and traits have recently emerged. Determining if and how hv-associated genes contribute to increased virulence of cKp strains is essential to addressing this growing threat. The rmpADC operon is an hv-associated locus that confers hypermucoviscosity (HMV), a key virulence phenotype, and rmp genes are often found in convergent strains. In this study, we aimed to determine if the rmp genes alone could increase the virulence of classical strains in the absence of other hv-associated genes. We introduced genetically distinct rmp loci from different lineages into a broad array of cKp isolates and found that, while many isolates became HMV positive, only a subset of these strains showed an increase in virulence in a mouse model of pneumonia. Sequence type and capsule type were not predictive of how rmp acquisition impacted the clinical isolates. Our results indicate that HMV is likely necessary but not sufficient for hypervirulence and that rmp sequence can influence virulence potential in classical strains.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

The rate of intrauterine egg-hatching increased in animals fed a glucose diet and the inhibition of dopamine or serotonin is sufficient to counteract the impact of the glucose diet. The glucose-induced intrauterine egg-hatching phenotype is independent of the SER-1 and SER-7 receptors yet dependent on the DAF16/FOXO transcription factor.

In a recent study, we discovered unusual haloacid dehalogenase (HAD)-like drimenol synthases (DMSs) of marine bacterial origin, including Aquimarina spongiae AsDMS and Flavivirga eckloniae FeDMS, which produce drimenol in vitro. In the present study, we conducted an in vivo investigation of the biosynthesis of this drimane-type sesquiterpene in marine bacteria. To verify drimenol accumulation in cultures of F. eckloniae, we mined the drimenol biosynthetic genes encoded in the F. eckloniae genome and found a putative AraC family transcriptional regulator in the drimenol gene cluster. Upon the addition of arabinose, we observed drimenol biosynthesis in F. eckloniae, demonstrating the importance of genomics-driven strategies in investigating natural products. Syntenic comparisons of drimenol gene clusters across bacteria revealed the unique evolution of drimenol biosynthesis in marine bacteria. Moreover, the distinct nature of drimenol pathways and relevant enzymes in bacteria compared to those in plants and fungi suggests parallel evolution. Remarkably, we describe two individual proteins from Sorangium cellulosum, HAD and terpene synthase with {beta} domain architecture, similar to HAD-like and terpene synthase {beta} domains of AsDMS, respectively, suggesting the fusion of monodomain proteins during the evolution of bacterial bifunctional DMSs.

Measuring 5' caps of RNAs can help quantify expression levels of mRNAs and lncRNAs.

Computational prediction of capping can therefore be used as a precursor to the prediction of transcriptional expression. Unfortunately, there is hardly any computational technique that has focused purely on predicting 5' capping. We have developed a transformer based method for computational prediction of capping from DNA sequences. Our Llama and ReLoRA-based pre-training model, and Llama and LoRA-based fine-tuning model predict 5' cap sites. We have used Leave-one-chromosome-out-cross-validation for our model.

The HSK model mice received TED (2.5, 5, or 15 mg/kg), and symptom progression was monitored. The therapeutic effects were evaluated through HE staining, corneal immunofluorescence, and HSV-1 gB quantification. Mechanistic studies were performed to examine the expression of TLR pathway genes, CD4+/CD8+ T-cell infiltration in the cornea and draining lymph nodes, and dendritic cell activation. Results: TED showed potent anti-HSV-1 activity in vitro and ameliorated HSK in mice, improving body weight and reducing corneal pathology and the incidence of encephalitis. It decreased HSV-1 loads in the cornea, trigeminal ganglion, and brain while modulating cytokines (downregulating IFN-/{gamma}, TNF-, and IL-1{beta} and upregulating IL-10).

This study investigates the duplication of dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) genes in Fagopyrum, focusing on their evolutionary origin and implications for flavonoid biosynthesis. DFR is a key enzyme in the flavonoid pathway, specifically involved in the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. DFR can accept three main substrates: dihydrokaempferol (DHK), dihydroquercetin (DHQ), and dihydromyricetin (DHM), and they exhibit variable substrate preferences. Result: Through comparative genomic analysis, this study identified three unique DFR gene copies in Fagopyrum, designated DFR1, DFR2a, and DFR2b. DFR2a and DFR2b show unique mutations affecting the 26-amino acid substrate-binding region, including substitution of the conserved asparagine at position 3 with valine or isoleucine, and an insertion between positions 5 and 6 involving glycine, arginine, or lysine. Synteny analysis reveals that DFR1 is located in a conserved region across related species, while DFR2a and DFR2b lie at distinct genomic loci. Gene expression analysis shows DFR1 is universally expressed, whereas DFR2a and DFR2b expression is primarily restricted to seeds and roots. Promoter analysis supports this, revealing the absence of MYB recognition elements in DFR2a and DFR2b that are present in the DFR1 promoter. Selective pressure analysis indicates that DFR2 copies are under strong purifying selection relative to ancestral DFR1 but appear slightly relaxed between DFR2a and DFR2b in a way suggesting functional differentiation, particularly in conserved regions.

In this study, using single-cell mRNA-seq and regulatory network reconstruction, we identify an additive signal integration rule in mouse neural progenitor cells (NPCs) where the probability of neuronal versus glial cell fate choice is quantitatively regulated log-linearly by the input of EGF/FGF2, BMP4, and Wnt signaling. By profiling the developing mouse brain and NPCs cultured in different media and 40 combinatorial signaling conditions, we show that NPCs extracted from mouse embryos lost neurogenic potential during cell culture and collapsed into glial states, and that combinatorial signal inputs can restore the neuronal population following a simple log-linear model. We build regulatory network models by D-SPIN that quantitatively capture cell state distribution shifts induced by signal combinations and identify circuit structures and candidate regulators underlying the neuronal-glial fate switch, such as Olig1, Neurod1, and Hes1. Circuit models suggest that the log linearity emerges through high transcriptional heterogeneity. The models further predict an early bipotent state expressing regulators of both fates together, and we verify the bipotent state in single-cell profiling. Our work demonstrates that single-cell profiling combined with D-SPIN network reconstruction can elucidate regulatory nodes that control cell fate selection to facilitate building mechanistic models, and identifies a design principle of noise-driven additive regulation in the logarithm cell-fate probability space, providing a new strategy for population-level stem cell control.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Reorganization of the nucleus to allow its passage through spaces much smaller than its resting diameter requires forces generated by the cytoskeleton, as well as active reorganization within the nucleus driven by ATPases that crosslink or move chromatin. Here, we show that two different nuclear ATPases, the BRG1/SMARCA4 motor of the BAF or SWI/SNF complex and the bifunctional crosslinking and loop extruding complex, cohesin, have opposite effects on the stiffness of isolated nuclei. Inhibition of BRG1 stiffens the nucleus, and cohesin softens it in karyoplasts derived from multiple cell types, including four different cancer cells, fibroblasts, and mesenchymal stem cells. The effects on isolated nuclear stiffness coincide with the effects of these ATPases on the ability of cells to migrate through tight spaces. Stiffening the nucleus inhibits single cell migration through micron-sized pores and the outward migration of tumor cell spheroids into a surrounding collagen matrix. Softening the nucleus by inhibiting cohesin has the opposite effect: it enhances single-cell migration through pores, at least for some cell types, and facilitates the outgrowth of cells from a tumor cell spheroid into the surrounding matrix. These results emphasize the importance of active motions generated within the nucleus for the global mechanics of the nucleus and the way that it deforms in response to externally generated stresses.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Methods: We proposed novel mathematical forecasting frameworks based on logistic growth ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and the characteristics of tumor responses to model the therapeutic effects of chemo- and radiation-induced killing. To validate the models, we cultured PDTOs from different patients and treated them with radiation (4 Gy and 8 Gy), chemotherapy (FOLFIRINOX at a previously determined organoid-specific IC50 dose), and combined regimens, respectively. The diameters of 20-40 organoids per patient were tracked and measured using brightfield images up to 7 or 9 days following each treatment to capture organoid growth dynamics data, which was used for model fitting. The accuracy of the modeling was evaluated by the average normalized mean squared errors (NMSE) of data fitting. Results: The proposed mathematical modeling frameworks accurately captured the observed growth dynamics of three PDTO samples after chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and chemoradiotherapy, as reflected by the average NMSE of data fitting, which are all close to zero (less than 0.0045). The fitted parameters, including killing strength, effect window, and peak killing timing, revealed significant heterogeneities in treatment responses across different PDTOs. Chemotherapy shows pronounced effectiveness in the early stage, while radiotherapy exhibits the effect later in the first week, and a significantly stronger secondary response occurs one week after radiation. Chemoradiotherapy combines the strengths of both modalities, producing pronounced effects in both response phases, with modeling results suggesting that the radiation-induced killing effect may play a dominant role in the synergistic interaction. Conclusions: Our modeling frameworks demonstrated high accuracy in modeling the heterogeneous therapeutic responses of PDTOs and provided insights into the dynamic killing effects and interplay between chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The modeling of therapeutic responses of PDTOs provides a valuable tool for optimizing treatment regimens and informing clinical trial design, thereby improving the efficacy of personalized medicine.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Here, we set out to identify KTIs with anti-herbivore activity and assessed the potential growth trade-off incurred by high KTI expression levels. Results: We identified 28 KTIs in the haploid genome of Populus x canescens, 21 of them were responsive to herbivory. The greatest induction was observed for KTI_400, KTI_600 and KTI_0882 (P. trichocarpa orthologues Potri.019G124400, Potri.019G124600, Potri.019G088200), whereas a moderate response was found for KTI_53200 (Potri017G153200 orthologue), a protein mainly localized in the xylem sap. Mechanical wounding and methyl-jasmonate resulted in fast and strong induction of KTI_400 and KTI_600 and moderate or lacking responses in KTI_0882 and KTI_53200. Increased KTI expression levels were associated with upregulation of ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE (AOS), whereas exposure to compounds eliciting ethylene or salicylic acid signaling did not affect KTIs. We generated stable CRISPR/Cas12a-mediated knock-out and p35S-mediated overexpression lines of KTI_400, KTI_600 and KTI_53200 in Populus x canescens. Among the wildtype and transgenic lines, only kti_400+kti_600 double knock-out lines produced greater biomass. Larvae of Helicoverpa armigera, a pest expanding in Europe due to a warmer climate, were allowed to feed on wildtype and transgenic poplar lines. Transgenic poplars overexpressing KTI_400 or KTI_600 resulted in reduced and their double knock-out lines in increased weight gain of the larvae. In contrast, overexpressing or knock-out lines of KTI_53200 had no effect on larval weight gain compared with controls. Conclusion: KTI_400 and KTI_600 are potent, natural in-planta anti-herbivorous agents. Their expression is associated with larval growth reductions. Modulation of KTI_53200 levels had no direct effects on the fitness of leaf-feeding H. armigera or on plant growth. This study sheds light on the potential application of KTI in plant defenses and biocontrol against herbivores in trees and presents new options to investigate growth-defense theories.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Here we present a genome-wide census and a single-cell-resolved expression atlas of the maize CA family. We identified 18 CA genes partitioning into  (8), {beta} (5) and {gamma} (5) subfamilies.

Phylogeny resolved three robust clades (UFboot >90%) and indicated closer affinity to rice than to Arabidopsis; synteny recovered 15 maize-rice and 3 maize-Arabidopsis orthologs. Promoters are enriched for ABRE, TCA-element and ARE, suggesting ABA, SA and redox regulation. Bulk RNA-seq across 21 tissues revealed strong tissue specificity ({tau} >0.7 for 12 genes), with {beta}-CAs elevated in leaves and -CAs in roots. Single-cell analyses further showed Zm{beta}CA3 enriched in mesophyll cells and ZmCA2 enriched in vascular/root-cap cells. Together, these data position {beta}-CAs as chloroplast-centered hubs for C4 photosynthesis, while /{gamma}-CAs support ion/pH buffering and mitochondrial metabolism.

We found that brain exposure to blue light caused local damage in the cerebral cortex in both young and old mice. Brain exposure to red light did not have any noticeable effect on young mice. However, it caused a marked reduction in electroencephalogram power, damaged fiber bundles throughout the brain, and brought about a coma-like state in old mice. The effect of red light on electroencephalogram power was dose-dependent and particularly strong in the theta range. When delivered at a lower intensity but over a longer period, red light produced a similar reduction in electroencephalogram power and brain damage as those seen in the mice treated with higher irradiation over a shorter period. These results indicate that the impact of light on electroencephalogram and brain tissue strongly depends not only on the light wavelength, duration and intensity of the exposure, but also on the age of the animal and type of tissue exposed to light.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Here, our study represents the first attempt to build prediction models for RBC alloimmunization using the large sample size and rich set of potential risk factors available in the Recipient Epidemiology and Donor Evaluation Study (REDS-III) recipient database. To develop the prediction models, we applied a range of approaches, including traditional statistical models (logistic regression), and modern machine learning (including gradient boosting, random forest, and XGBoost), deep learning (the multilayer perceptron method), and large language models (LLM).

LLMs show promising results with the best F1 scores (0.677-0.687), though they are limited by their inability to provide uncertainty estimates, they hold the potential for use as an interactive chatbot for patients.

While motors and lysosomal surface adaptors driving this movement are well studied, how the microtubule cytoskeleton specifies lysosomal transport and its coupling to mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling remains unclear. Here, we show that tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) define the tracks that guide nutrient-responsive lysosome positioning. Using super-resolution imaging and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that lysosomes carrying active mTORC1 preferentially traffic along tyrosinated microtubules to reach the cell periphery, whereas detyrosinated microtubules restrict their motility. Nutrient stimulation enhances this outward transport, while concurrently suppressing microtubule detyrosination through mTORC1-S6K1 signaling, likely via inhibition of vasohibin activity. This ensures selective expansion of tyrosinated microtubule tracks to sustain mTORC1 signaling. Strikingly, in cancer cells where aberrant mTORC1 activity correlates with altered microtubule tyrosination, restoring microtubule detyrosination rescues mTORC1 hyperactivation and suppresses cell migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Thus, demonstrating that tubulin post-translational modifications (PTMs) define the tracks that guide the positioning of nutrient-responsive lysosomes. These findings uncover a crosstalk between mTORC1 and tubulin tyrosination/detyrosination status that couples nutrient availability to lysosomal dynamics and identify microtubule tyrosination as a regulatory node with therapeutic potential in cancer.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

However, the action of existing therapies is nonuniform and the causative mechanism for this variability remains poorly understood. The differences between the microRNA profiles of individuals have been suggested to impact platelet reactivity and treatment outcomes. microRNA-150 (miR-150) has been previously associated, in several clinical reports with platelet function variability and cardiovascular events. Therefore, we initiated our analysis by examining the mechanistic role of miR 150 in platelet function. We employed transgenic zebrafish larvae designed to specifically increase miR-150 expression in thrombocytes. Laser-induced caudal vein injury in these animals resulted in a smaller thrombus and decreased thrombocyte accumulation. RNA sequencing of miR-150-overexpressing thrombocytes identified a downregulated transcript encoding microtubule associated serine/threonine kinase-like (mastl), a key regulator of P2Y12 receptor downstream signaling. Overnight treatment of the transgenic fish with clopidogrel, a P2Y12 inhibitor, showed decreased thrombus formation in the control, but not in miR-150-overexpressing animals. This phenotype was reversed by overexpressing mastl. Next, we utilized a VASP phosphorylation assay to show that MASTL-deficiency partially protects human platelets from P2Y12 inhibition. Finally, using miRNA:mRNA interaction predictors we identified MASTL-targeting miRNAs in humans - miR 17-5p and miR-106a-5p - which were significantly upregulated in a population of clopidogrel-resistant patients. Our studies therefore support a model where an increase in miR-150 in zebrafish and miR-17-5p or miR-106a-5p in humans results in MASTL downregulation, which decreases VASP phosphorylation in platelets and thus makes them resistant to P2Y12 inhibition.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the kinetics and mechanism of the MIC telomere elimination. Comparison of the MIC and MAC genome sequences indicated that the MIC telomeres are excised from chromosomes as part of larger MIC-limited sequences (MLSs) through chromosomal breakage. We confirmed this using an optimized oligo-FISH protocol and and found that their elimination occurs in parallel with other programmed DNA elimination processes. CRISPR-Cas9 disruption of a MLS-associated Chromosome Breakage Sequence (CBS) showed that elimination of the MLS was not blocked but instead led to loss of adjacent MAC-destined sequence (MDS), suggesting abnormal co-elimination. In biparental crosses of the CBS mutant, however, both MLS and MDS were retained, DNA elimination was broadly disrupted, and no viable progeny were produced. These findings indicate that chromosome breakage at MLS-associated CBSs is essential for the proper separation of MLSs and MDSs, ensuring correct DNA elimination and successful sexual progeny development. We propose that the MIC telomere elimination is subsumed within the broader process of programmed DNA elimination.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Resolving the mechanisms underlying these naturally occurring indirect interactions and their impact on invasion dynamics is a key challenge toward risk assessment and environmental management. In this contribution, we investigated how indirect interactions with several native species contribute to variations in Dryocosmus kuriphilus infestation level in 24 natural chestnut tree populations of the French Eastern Pyrenees.

To address this limitation, we present a telomere-to-telomere genome benchmark that achieves near-perfect accuracy (i.e. no detectable errors) across 99.4% of the complete, diploid HG002 genome.

To facilitate application of the benchmark, we developed tools for measuring the accuracy of sequencing reads, phased variant call sets, and genome assemblies against a diploid reference. Genome-wide analyses show that state-of-the-art de novo assembly methods resolve 2 to 7% more sequence and outperform variant calling accuracy by an order of magnitude, yielding just one error per 100 kb across 99.9% of the benchmark regions.

In plants, PI-PLCs have been implicated in various physiological processes, including immunity. Tomato SlPLC2 was previously shown to be implicated in susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. However, whether this observation extends to pathogens with different lifestyles and evolutionary origins, remains unknown. Here, we investigated SlPLC2 function during infection with Phytophthora infestans, a globally devastating oomycete and causal agent of potato and tomato late blight. CRISPR-Cas9 knockout SlPLC2 plants showed significantly reduced disease symptoms, lower pathogen biomass, and decreased sporangia production, indicating impaired colonization. Upon infection, SlPLC2 knockout lines displayed attenuated expression of salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive genes suggesting disrupted hormone signaling. Consistent with PLC role during plant defense, early immune responses such as hydrogen peroxide accumulation and callose deposition were reduced in knockout plants. At the cellular level, these plants allow fewer infection vesicles formation by P. infestans, accompanied by an increase in expression of a biotrophy-associated effector gene PiAvrblb2, suggesting impaired establishment of infection. In Nicotiana benthamiana SlPLC2-GFP localizes predominantly at the plasma membrane. Upon P. infestans inoculations, SlPLC2-GFP localizes to the membrane surrounding infection vesicles, where we also detected phosphoinositides PI4P and PI(4,5)P2. Overexpression of SlPLC2 in Nicotiana benthamiana enhanced susceptibility to P. infestans, reinforcing its positive role in colonization. Together, these findings identify SlPLC2 as a susceptibility factor associated with enhanced P. infestans colonization.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Based on previous transcriptome analyses, we hypothesized that aphids block effective jasmonate (JA) defenses by inducing an antagonistic abscisic acid (ABA) signal. To test this hypothesis, we used a combination of gene expression analyses, measurements of hormone levels, and aphid bioassays on plants with reduced expression of ABA-related genes. Aphid feeding attenuated JA responses in soybean plants and facilitated the growth of a chewing herbivore. Aphid-treated plants had increased levels of cis-JA but not biologically active JA-isoleucine, and aphid feeding induced expression of genes associated with JA-Ile catabolism. In parallel, aphid-feeding induced higher levels of ABA. ABA treatment and knockdown lines impaired in ABA biosynthesis (aba2-RNAi) or signaling (scof-1-RNAi), showed that ABA suppressed wound-induced JA responses. Aphid populations were significantly reduced on ABA-deficient plants and aphid-regulated attenuation of JA signaling was abolished in these lines. Remarkably, plants defective in ABA signaling had increased JA signaling in the absence of stressors. Our results indicate that, in soybean, the ABA pathway is necessary to control basal levels of JA and soybean aphids exploit this ABA-JA antagonism to suppress plant defenses.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

How chemotherapy-induced remodeling of the tumor microenvironment modulates drug sensitivity remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that chemotherapy induced IL1b-dependent neutrophil accumulation in tumors, driving chemoresistance in HGSC. Using patient samples, bulk transcriptomic profiling before and after chemotherapy revealed post-treatment upregulation of IL1B, and single-cell RNA sequencing identified myeloid cells as its principal source. In a chemoresistant murine metastatic ovarian cancer model, chemotherapy increased neutrophils and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in omentum tumors; these increases were abrogated in IL1b-deficient mice, with expansion of activated CD8+ T cells and tumor control. Neutrophil depletion in wild-type mice recapitulated the chemosensitive phenotype of IL1b-deficient mice. In vitro, IL1b did not alter cancer cell-intrinsic chemosensitivity, whereas NETs reduced the chemosensitivity of cancer cells. Additionally, the dominant IL1b receptor (IL1R1) was predominantly expressed in tumor-associated fibroblasts in humans and mice. Consistently, IL1R1-deficient mice exhibited chemosensitivity with decreased neutrophil accumulation and increased IFNg+TNF+CD8+ T cells. We also found that chemotherapy upregulated CXCL2 in patients and that ablating IL1b-IL1R1 axis decreased CXCL2 expression in tumor-associated fibroblasts in mice. Finally, residual human HGSC tumor after chemotherapy showed increased neutrophils and a trend toward more NETs. Collectively, these findings illuminate a paradoxical, cancer cell-extrinsic mechanism in HGSC whereby chemotherapy itself amplifies chemoresistance and suggest that targeting chemotherapy-induced inflammation may help overcome treatment resistance.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

This zoonotic event emphasizes the urgent need for H5 vaccines that elicit strong, durable, cross-reactive immune responses in cattle, especially young calves. To address this, we immunized mice and cattle with a centralized consensus H5 vaccine, designed to localize to the central node of the human H5 phylogenetic tree. The vaccine was delivered using serotype-switched adenoviral vectors in a prime:boost regimen, combined with intramuscular and intranasal coadministration to target systemic and mucosal immunity and elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses. This approach strategically integrates multiple innovative features: centralized consensus immunogens, mucosal targeting, and vector serotype switching that are aimed at maximizing immune protection against H5N1 viruses. Our results show that vaccination elicited strong humoral and cellular immunity in both mice and calves. In challenge experiments, vaccinated mice were fully protected against lethal infection with multiple divergent H5N1 strains, including the 2024 bovine isolate (A/bovine/Ohio/B24OSU-439/2024). Given that vaccine induced immunity was consistent across species, these results support the translatability of the mouse model findings to cattle.

Here we isolated three species of anaerobic fungi, including a novel Piromyces species. We investigated if these species have distinct roles in the digestion of fibrous feed components, via assessment of changes caused to plant material itself. We found Neocallimastix frontalis isolate CoB3 and Piromyces isolate SHC digested plant materials more effectively than Caecomyces communis isolate SHB. The three fungi had distinct effects on feed composition. N. frontalis CoB3 degraded hemicelluloses and cellulose to a similar extent, Piromyces spp. SHC preferentially degraded hemicellulose, while C. communis SHB preference depended on the substrate. From the panel of monosaccharides that may result from such degradative activity, all fungi consumed only glucose, suggesting involvement of mechanisms more complex than only fungal carbon source usage.

Deep sequencing and de novo assembly enabled the investigation of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from periopathogens within the genus Tannerella. DNA preservation within the dental calculus of King Richard III was found to be exceptional, yielding an extraordinarily well-preserved oral microbiota. Oral microbiome species diversity fell within the range previously observed among other northern European populations over the past 7,000 years, suggesting that a royal lifestyle and a rich diet did not substantially shift his oral microbiome composition. Reconstructed Tannerella genomes contained many virulence factors found today among periopathogens, including Tannerella forsythia. Insufficient plant and animal DNA was recovered to investigate diet, suggesting that dental calculus may not be a sufficient source of dietary DNA for dietary reconstruction, even when well-preserved.

As morbidity and mortality from CF results from a lack of mucus clearance that leads to chronic bacterial infections and progressive loss of lung function, site-specific insertion of a CFTR cDNA into the endogenous CFTR locus in airway basal stem cells (ABSCs) could prove curative for all disease-causing mutations. This study describes the development of nonviral genome editing reagents, designed to be packaged into nonviral delivery systems. An sgRNA targeting the 5` untranslated region of CFTR was characterized as directing high on-target cutting and displaying a safe off-target profile. Airway cell lines electroporated with chemically-modified (1-Aminohexane - AmC6), linear double-stranded DNA (ldsDNA) constructs were utilized as an Homology Directed Repair (HDR) donor, initially optimized with an mCitrine reporter. Expectedly, when the 780bp mCitrine cDNA was replaced with the 4.4kb CFTR cDNA, integration efficiency dropped significantly. However, 1-2% integration of codon optimized donors was sufficient to restore CFTR expression in the bulk edited population of human bronchial epithelial cell line, 16HBE14o- (16HBE), to levels reaching 50% of wildtype expression as measured by Western Blot. Electrophysiological validation of CFTR ion channel function measured via Ussing Chamber Assay revealed that these bulk edited populations exhibit greater than 40% restoration of the chloride ion currents of the measured wildtype controls. These results demonstrate that low levels of CFTR integration can be made therapeutically relevant by optimizing the designs of gene editing reagents.

By modulating the intron content, RNA processing restricts HP1-RNA interactions at chromatin, thus enabling heterochromatin organization. Disruption of HP1 condensates due to enhanced interactions with unspliced RNA leads to loss of heterochromatin and the activation of stress response protective genes. We propose that RNA is a central component of heterochromatin that modulates HP1 condensates, and that RNA processing enzymes act as a surveillance mechanism for condensates by dynamically regulating the network of multi-valent interactions between RNA and chromatin factors.

A custom DNA aptamer, termed HINT, was developed to bind GP120 across major HIV-1 subtypes (Groups M and P; subtypes A and B) with nanomolar affinity. To amplify binding strength, HINT aptamers were spatially patterned onto a net-shaped DNA nanostructure (DNA-NetHINT) that geometrically matches the trimeric GP120 spikes on the viral surface.

Since this pupil-linked cognitive fatigue is mitigated by sparkling water intake in casual players, we hypothesized that sparkling water prevents cognitive fatigue and sustains esports performance in esports athletes under real training conditions that reflect competitive practice. To test this hypothesis, nineteen hardcore esports players participated in a randomized crossover trial. Each completed two 3-hour sessions of head-to-head virtual football matches while consuming either sparkling water or plain water. Subjective fatigue, enjoyment, and executive function (flanker task) were assessed, and pupil diameter, heart rate, and salivary cortisol were continuously monitored. In-game performance was also recorded. Accuracy declined and pupil constriction progressed under the plain water condition, whereas executive accuracy was preserved and pupil diameter was maintained over the three-hour session in the sparkling water condition. Subjective ratings of fatigue and enjoyment increased similarly in both conditions. Heart rate, including both mean and peak values, and salivary cortisol concentrations showed no significant differences between conditions. In terms of in-game performance, goals, passes, and interceptions did not differ between conditions, whereas the number of fouls was lower and the number of shots was higher in the sparkling water condition. These findings demonstrate that sparkling water mitigates cognitive fatigue and sustains esports performance in esports athletes under real training conditions. As a caffeine- and sugar-free beverage, sparkling water may serve as a practical, low-risk intervention for managing cognitive fatigue and supporting daily practice in modern esports settings.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

H.; Hixson, B.; Hodgson, J. J.; Buchon, N.", "abstract": "Aedes aegypti, a major vector of arboviruses, relies on its midgut as a key interface with microbial communities that influence vector competence. While ingestion of pathogenic bacteria is known to trigger both immune and regenerative responses in the mosquito gut, the signaling pathways that govern epithelial renewal remain poorly defined. Here, we address this gap by performing transcriptomic profiling of the Aedes aegypti midgut following oral infection with entomopathogenic bacteria. We uncover a broad transcriptional activation of immune pathways, including IMD, Toll, and notably, the JAK-STAT signaling cascade. Functional knockdown experiments reveal that JAK-STAT signaling is essential for infection-induced epithelial cell proliferation and survival, but dispensable for bacterial clearance, supporting a specialized role in tissue repair and infection tolerance. We further identify a previously uncharacterized cytokine-like gene, Upd-like, structurally related to Drosophila Unpaired proteins and mammalian cytokines, which is strongly induced upon bacterial challenge and activates JAK-STAT signaling in mosquito cells. Silencing Upd-like markedly impairs epithelial regeneration after infection, establishing it as a key regulator of gut homeostasis. Together, these findings demonstrate a conserved function for JAK-STAT signaling in midgut epithelial renewal and identify Upd-like as a novel cytokine mediating regenerative responses during bacterial infection.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

R.; Murali, R.; Orphan, V. J.", "abstract": "Efficient energy metabolism is essential for microorganisms living on the thermodynamic edge. Consortia of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME-2) and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) represent globally relevant syntrophic associations capable of growing with minimal amounts of free energy and can persist when methane becomes limiting. Their potential for physiological plasticity, including the use of electron donors beyond methane is poorly understood. Carbon monoxide (CO) has been reported in seep environments and represents a thermodynamically favourable alternative electron donor due to its low reduction potential. We demonstrate that environmental ANME-SRB consortia can oxidize CO in the absence of methane, in anoxic microcosm experiments using a combination of stable isotope geochemical tracers, metatranscriptomics, and single cell activity measurements (FISH-nanoSIMS). The oxidation of CO was coupled with sulphate-reduction by syntrophic consortia, and, in the absence of sulphate, through CO2 reduction to methane by ANME-2. Under these conditions, the production of methane was one ninth the rate of methanotrophy coupled to sulphate-reduction. Paired single cell FISH-nanoSIMS analysis of anabolic activity indicates that CO respiration appears to support cell maintenance rather than active growth, consistent with the observed down-regulation of energy generating complexes in ANME (e.g., mtr, rnf, etc.). The versatile capability of CO oxidation by anaerobic methanotrophic consortia broadens our understanding of carbon cycling in methane seeps and highlights potential mechanisms of resilience by methanotrophic archaea under changing geochemical regimes.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Therefore, studies are actively looking to identify specific surface biomarkers that not only can differentiate dysfunctional cell populations, particularly in the context of diabetes, but also can be used to develop therapeutic targets. While {beta} cell heterogeneity has been explored at the single-cell genomic and transcriptomic levels, in this study we aimed to demonstrate that even when a new plasma membrane epitope is identified, characterization of the proteome of cells expressing the same surface protein confirms that different subpopulations do exist. Using single-cell proteomic approach, we analyzed the proteome of MIN6 and Tc1 cells expressing Cd71, Cd99, and P538, which binds to a Fab-phage-538 identified in our previous study. Our findings suggest that the MIN6 (P538+) subpopulation may hold a more specialized functional identity compared to the other MIN6 (Cd71+), MIN6 (Cd99+), and control subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate that cell lines derived from the same tissue and expressing the same surface epitope can exhibit heterogeneity in their proteome. Indeed, while the specific expression of 17 protein groups confers to the MIN6 (P538+) subpopulation an insulin production and secretion-oriented identity, Tc1 (P538+), on the other hand, was characterized by only two proteins with no established involvement in glucagon production or secretion. Also, while the MIN6 (Cd99+) subpopulation may be predisposed to the development of insulin deficiency compared to MIN6 (Cd71+) and MIN6 (P538+), the proteomic profile of the Tc1 (Cd99+) subpopulation suggests that this subpopulation may hold an ability to adapt to stressful environmental conditions. Finally, when comparing MIN6 (Cd71+) to Tc1 (Cd71+), our findings suggest that the MIN6 subpopulation has probably a lesser role in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) genesis in the context of iron homeostasis disruption than Tc1 (Cd71+).", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

R.; Lin, S.; Huang, Y.-C.; Forti, K. M.; Schwoerer, S.", "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides key biochemical and biomechanical cues that govern fundamental cellular processes, including growth and migration. ECM dysregulation and altered cell-matrix interactions are a driver of cancer progression, exemplified by pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), where an abnormally dense, collagen-rich, and stiff ECM correlates with poor patient outcomes. The PDAC microenvironment is poorly perfused, resulting in altered nutrient availability, yet how this metabolic stress shapes the ECM and its biological activity remains poorly understood. Herein, we demonstrate that glutamine, a key amino acid depleted in poorly perfused PDAC regions, regulates the biochemical composition, mechanical properties, and biological activity of fibroblast-derived ECM. As glutamine availability increases, fibroblasts shift from producing a basement membrane-like ECM toward an interstitial, mature ECM enriched in fibrillar collagens. The ECM generated under glutamine-rich conditions is stiffer, which limits PDAC cell growth, while simultaneously, the elevated collagen I content promotes migration in a 3D spheroid model. Mechanistically, glutamine-dependent collagen I engages integrin 2 (ITGA2) to activate focal adhesion kinase signaling, driving PDAC cell migration independent of growth. In PDAC patients, glutamine stress inversely correlates with collagen expression in CAFs, with collagen I-ITGA2 as the most enriched ECM receptor interaction pair compared to the normal pancreas. These findings establish nutrient availability as a key regulator of ECM biology and offer new avenues to therapeutically intervene with dysregulated cell-matrix interactions in PDAC.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

Despite their unique ability to modulate the immune system, the translation of cytokine-based therapies to the clinic has been significantly hindered by severe toxicities resulting from the pleiotropy and off-target effects of many cytokines. Here, we present a general strategy for the design of switchable cytokines that enables precise control over cytokine activity using the clinically approved drug, Venetoclax. We rationally designed self-inhibited Switchable InterLeukins (SwILs) by embedding the chemically controlled interface (Bcl-2: BIM-BH3) into the cytokines structure, resulting in conditional cytokines activated by Venetoclax. We showed the broad applicability of this strategy across various cytokines, including IL-2, IL-15, and IL-10. In vivo studies with IL-15 demonstrated that the SwILs achieved Venetoclax-dependent tumor control comparable to that of the native cytokine. Additionally, we showed that this strategy can be expanded to respond to other tumor-intrinsic stimuli, such as tumor-specific proteases. Overall, SwILs offer control of cytokine activity, enhancing the safety and clinical applicability of cytokine-based therapeutics.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

SRF encodes Serum Response Factor, a well-characterized transcription factor that regulates muscle development. We characterized four fusion genes: SRF::RELA, SRF::FOXO1, SRF::ICA1L, and SRF::PDGFRB. All localized to the nucleus and dimerized through the SRF MADS box. SRF::RELA, SRF::FOXO1, and SRF::ICA1L acted as constitutively active transcription factors independent of canonical cofactors, binding SRF target promoters and driving transcription via the partner transactivation domain (TAD). A cryptic TAD was uncovered in ICA1L. These fusions promoted mesenchymal cell growth and upregulated muscle-related genes in mesenchymal stem cells, recapitulating transcriptional signatures of human tumors. In contrast, SRF::PDGFRB acted through its kinase domain, was imatinib-sensitive, activated STAT1 and stimulated inflammation genes, consistent with its tumor phenotype.

F.", "abstract": "Background: The regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism by vascular endothelial factors remains poorly characterized, despite its relevance to atherosclerosis and steatosis. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) is essential for hepatic lipid metabolism, but its regulation by endothelial cells has not been previously investigated. Objective: This study examined whether endothelial choline ethanolamine phosphotransferase 1 (CEPT1) modulates hepatic MTTP activity, impacting systemic lipid homeostasis and aortic plaque formation. Methods and Results: Human steatotic liver samples exhibited reduced CEPT1 and MTTP protein levels, correlating with diminished lipid exports. In mice, endothelial-specific Cept1 knockdown decreased hepatic MTTP expression, reduced serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels, and markedly attenuated aortic atherosclerosis without evidence of fat malabsorption. In vitro, endothelial CEPT1 silencing suppressed MTTP activity in co-cultured hepatocytes via a paracrine mechanism involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  (PPAR) signaling, which was rescued by fenofibrate treatment. Aortic histology confirmed reduced plaque burden and macrophage infiltration in CEPT1-deficient mice. Conclusions: Endothelial CEPT1 critically regulates hepatic MTTP through a paracrine axis, influencing lipid metabolism and atherogenesis. Targeting endothelial CEPT1 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to reduce steatosis and vascular atherosclerosis.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

We used deep coverage phylogenetic analyses to trace the evolutionary origins of each human Kv channel. 39/40 human channels were already present in the common ancestor of jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) and as many as 36 could have an origin in a genome duplication within the stem gnathostome lineage. The Elk channel Kv12.2 is the newest human Kv stemming from a gene duplication in the ancestor of tetrapods and lobe-finned fish. Kv5.1, is the oldest human Kv channel, traceable to the stem chordate lineage. We found evidence for a total of 45 widespread gnathostome Kv channels. Humans lost five channels that can still be found in some other gnathostome lineages. Birds and mammals have the smallest remaining Kv channel sets among gnathostomes and a lineage-specific genome duplication in teleost fish increased their ancestral Kv set to as many as 69 channels. We expressed orthologs of the 5 gnathostome channels missing in humans from vampire bat (Kv3.5), harpy eagle (Kv7.1L), duck-billed platypus (Kv8.3), coelacanth (Kv9.4) and axolotl (Kv12.4). Each has some unique functional characteristics, but their gating properties are largely redundant with existing human Kv paralogs. The human Kv set still contains substantial gating redundancy and we argue that loss-of-function mutations driving partitioning and subfunctionalization have probably had a greater influence on the broad retention of ancestral gnathostome Kv channels than gain-of-function gating optimizations.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}

This phenomenon, known as \"field cancerization,\" posits that histologically normal peritumoral tissue is, in fact, a pre-neoplastic field harboring incipient molecular alterations that confound genomic studies using it as a normal control. To overcome this limitation, we performed a three-way comparative transcriptomic analysis of tumor, peritumoral, and true-normal gastric tissues using a deep learning framework. We identified a stable 138-gene signature established within the peritumoral field and conserved in the tumor, which was absent in healthy controls. Within this signature, three key COSMIC-listed driver genes were highlighted: the Hippo pathway component FAT4 and the p53-inhibitor MDM4 were upregulated, while the EMT-suppressor NDRG1 was repressed. Co-expression analysis revealed a dynamic rewiring of these drivers, with a significant positive correlation between FAT4 and MDM4 emerging exclusively in the peritumoral field. In contrast, a negative correlation between FAT4 and NDRG1 was observed specifically in the tumor context. In public cohorts, high expression of FAT4 and MDM4 was significantly associated with poor patient prognosis, whereas NDRG1 showed no prognostic association. Critically, the prognostic power of MDM4 was validated in our local patient cohort. Our findings demonstrate that the peritumoral field is a molecularly distinct state in gastric carcinogenesis, characterized by a metabolic shift, and identify FAT4 and MDM4 as key drivers of this early transition, with significant potential as prognostic biomarkers.", "date": "2025-09-21", "journal": ""}
