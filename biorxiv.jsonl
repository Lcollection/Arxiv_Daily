Genetic studies in mice have shown that they act in a dose-dependent manner, with Sp8 exerting a substantially stronger effect than Sp6. Here, we integrate ChIPmentation-seq and RNA-seq analyses to elucidate their genome-wide regulatory networks and mechanisms of action. Our results show that Sp8 has a dual mode of action either directly binding GC-rich motifs or indirectly binding AT-rich motifs through Dlx. In contrast, Sp6 primarily acts through AT-rich motifs, via interaction with cofactors such as Dlx5. Both factors regulate key components of the Wnt, FGF, and BMP signaling pathways, central to limb patterning, and display both cooperative and independent roles. We further show that Sp8 and Sp6 can form homo- and heterodimers, as well as interact with Dlx5, revealing a complex regulatory network. Our findings provide molecular insight into limb morphogenesis and have potential implications for understanding congenital limb malformations.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

C.; Kazama, H.", "abstract": "Odors are intimately tied to the taste system to aid food selection and determine the sensory experience of food. However, how smell and taste are integrated in the nervous system to drive feeding remains elusive. We show in Drosophila that odors alone activate gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), trigger proboscis extension reflex (PER), a canonical taste-evoked feeding behavior, and enhance food intake. Odor-evoked PER requires the function of sugar-sensing GRNs but not olfactory organs. Calcium imaging and electrophysiological recording show that GRNs directly respond to odors. Odor-evoked PER is mediated by the Gr5a receptor, and is bidirectionally modulated by olfactory binding proteins. Finally, odors and sucrose co-applied to GRNs synergistically enhance PER and food consumption. These results reveal a cell-intrinsic mechanism for odor-taste multimodal integration that takes place as early as in GRNs, indicating that unified chemosensory experience is a product of layered integration in peripheral neurons and in the brain.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

We found that pathogens on average tend to have a larger number of protein-coding genes, including effectors, and tRNA genes. In addition, the non-repetitive size of their genomes is larger than that of non-pathogenic species. However, this pattern is not consistent across all groups. Insect endoparasites and symbionts have smaller genome sizes and genes with longer exons; moreover, insect-vectored pathogens possess fewer genes compared to those not transmitted by insects.

Some dyads can maintain strong and long-lasting relationships, while others are only connected by weak or fleeting ties. Evidence accumulates that aspects of social relationships are related to reproductive success and survival. Yet, few of these analyses have considered that frequent or prolonged affiliative interactions between two individuals can be principally driven by two distinct processes: namely, the overall gregariousness of individuals, and dyadic affinity, i.e., the preference the members of the dyad have to interact specifically with one another. Crucially, these two axes of sociality cannot be observed directly, although distinguishing them is essential for many research questions, for example, when estimating kin bias or when studying the link between sociality and fitness. We present a principled statistical framework to estimate the two underlying sociality axes using dyadic interaction data. We also provide a basic R package bamoso, which implements models based on the proposed framework and allows visual and numerical evaluation of the estimated sociality axes. We demonstrate critical features of the proposed modeling framework with simulated and empirical data: (1) the possibility of checking model fit against observed data, (2) the assessment of uncertainty in the estimated sociality parameters, and (3) the possibility to extend it to more complex models that use interaction data to estimate the relationship between individual-level social features and individual-level outcomes in a unified model.

This raises the question of how insular genetic variation becomes incorporated into continental populations, contrary to expectations of unidirectional colonization. Here, we investigate whether and how island-derived genetic variation has influenced a continental population through population establishment and gene flow in a bird species where frequent trans-ocean dispersal is expected. Location: Continental East Asia (Russian Far East), Japanese Archipelago Taxon: Swinhoe's Rail (Coturnicops exquisitus) Materials and Methods: We apply integrative phylogenomics to reconstruct the spatiotemporal history of the species. Colonization sequences and gene flow are inferred by comparing four different phylogenetic reconstruction methods, using mitochondrial sequences obtained by Sanger sequencing and genome-wide data obtained by genotyping by sequencing (MIG-seq). We assess a history of colonization and gene flow based on summary statistics, demographic trajectory inference by Stairway Plot2, demographic modeling by fastsimcoal2, and species distribution modeling. Results: Analyses collectively supported asymmetric gene flow from the island to the continental population, following divergence around the Middle Pleistocene. Post-divergence, the island maintained a large and stable population, while the continental population underwent a severe bottleneck, suggesting a significant evolutionary role of the island for the continental population. Additionally, evidence of recent re-establishment of the island by continental individuals indicates dynamic exchange and persistence within a continent-island metapopulation. Main conclusions: The maintenance of insular genetic variation within a dynamic continent-island metapopulation may have enabled the island to act as a genetic and demographic reservoir for the continental population. Thus, continent-island metapopulation dynamics may be a key evolutionary pathway through which island populations contribute to continental genetic diversity.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Many reconciliation algorithms consider only duplication and loss events (and sometimes horizontal transfer), ignoring effects of the coalescent process, including incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Here, we present a new algorithm for carrying out reconciliation that accurately accounts for incomplete lineage sorting by treating ILS as a series of nearest neighbor interchange (NNI) events. For discordant branches of the gene tree identified by last common ancestor (LCA) mapping, our algorithm recursively chooses the optimal history by comparing the cost of duplication and loss to the cost of NNI and loss. We demonstrate the accuracy of our new method, which we call reconcILS, using a new simulation engine (dupcoal) that can accurately generate gene trees produced by the interaction of duplication, ILS, and loss. We show that reconcILS is much more accurate than models that ignore ILS, and at least as accurate or better than the leading method that can model ILS, duplication, and loss. We discuss how our method can also be extended in the future for use as a reconciliation algorithm in additional scenarios.

Inspired by the remarkable success of pre-trained language models in natural language processing (NLP), protein language models (ProtLMs) have emerged as powerful tools in advancing protein science. While NLP leverages flexible text-based control tags to prompt language model generation, the restricted amino acid space (limited to 20 residues) imposes inherent constraints on achieving analogous controllability. In this study, we propose PrefixProt, a framework for controllable protein design that employs prefix tuning to learn virtual tokens as control tags. These virtual tokens are adaptively tailored to diverse protein properties through a data-driven manner and can be combinatorially integrated to enable multi-objective control over protein generation. The effectiveness of PrefixProt was validated through extensive experiments encompassing both protein structure design (e.g. alpha-helix or beta-sheet topologies) and protein function design (e.g. antimicrobial or anticancer peptide activities). Benchmark results demonstrate that prefix virtual tokens efficiently guide the pre-trained ProtLM by optimizing a smaller number of trainable parameters, outperforming other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods and text-guided ProtLMs, particularly in scenarios with limited data availability. More importantly, the compositional flexibility of virtual tokens facilitates the generation of proteins with multiple target properties, substantially expanding the scope of design possibilities. By harmonizing controllability, efficiency and generalizability, PrefixProt establishes a robust framework for de novo protein design, with promising applications in drug discovery and biomedicine.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Performance improved at cued locations and worsened at uncued locations compared to distributed attention, demonstrating a selective processing tradeoff. Pre-target BOLD responses in cortical visual field maps revealed two key changes: First, a stimulus-independent baseline shift, with increases near cued locations and decreases elsewhere, paralleling behavioral results. Second, a shift in population receptive field centers toward the attended location. Both effects increased in higher visual areas.

Using global compilations of Rhizarian, colonial N2-fixer, and Crustacean images, we reveal the paramount role of iron in shaping the size structure and related biogeography of these groups. Our findings underscore the importance of atmospheric sources of iron for N2-fixers and Rhizarians while total iron, accounting for organic and inorganic compounds, appeared to explain most of the variance in Crustacean size structure via apparent recycling.

However findings were often equivocal for both theoretical and empirical work, as the same topologies have also been associated with expression robustness. Our objective is thus to finally decipher the regulatory causes of gene expression plasticity, using both theoretical predictions from a simulated network evolution model and the empirical data of Escherichia coli regulatory network. We investigated the link between network topology and gene expression at three levels: the number of regulators, the number and the proportion of loops (feedback loops, feedforward loops and diamond loops), and the proportion of unique motifs (here characterized by the position of up- or down-regulations within loops). Consistent results from our empirical and theoretical approaches revealed that plastic genes were regulated by more genes on average. Selection (as opposed to simulations under strict genetic drift) bias strongly the distribution of motifs, however this distribution was not different between plastic and non-plastic genes.

Mechanistically, two key pathways induce TEs upregulation: inhibition of the KAP1/TRIM28 repressive complex by phosphorylation, and expression of the pioneer transcription factor double-homeobox 4 (DUX4), which is known to be involved in TE-induction during zygotic genome activation in embryonic development. DUX4 is induced by DNA viruses, it binds to TEs upon infection and analysis of genes adjacent to TEs shows pathways that are important for DNA virus infections. Analysis of knockdown, knockout and overexpression data reveal that almost all TEs expressed upon herpesviral infection are regulated by KAP1/TRIM28 and DUX4.

Here, we simultaneously assessed the translatomes of the chloroplast and the cytoplasm via ribosome profiling and revealed the differential mechanisms employed by these two systems to cope with acute light/dark transitions: in chloroplasts, translational regulation is employed, whereas in the cytoplasm, control of the mRNA abundance is implemented. This strategy is widely conserved in land plants (Arabidopsis and the grass plant Brachypodium) and green algae (Chlamydomonas). The translational control in chloroplasts may be established based on organelle symbiosis; the primitive chloroplast in Glaucophyta (Cyanophora) was found to have already acquired translational control, whereas cyanobacteria (Synechocystis) control the mRNA abundance. Moreover, reduced plastoquinones and active cytosolic protein synthesis drive chloroplastic translation of the complex subunits in the light.

Given the high structural similarity among homologues, achieving receptor selectivity while minimizing off-target effects remains a major challenge in designing drugs targeting GPCRs. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs), comprising five subtypes, are therapeutically important GPCRs critical for immune and cardiovascular functions. Siponimod, an FDA-approved drug for multiple sclerosis, selectively modulates S1PR1 over S1PR2, unlike earlier S1PR modulators. However, the molecular basis for this selectivity is unclear, as cellular and biochemical assays provide limited insights. In this study, we used long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how S1P and Siponimod binding affect S1PR1 and S1PR2 structural dynamics. Both ligands exhibited strong active site binding in both receptors. Crucially, while S1P and Siponimod induced similar activation-linked conformational changes in S1PR1, Siponimod failed to trigger these rearrangements in S1PR2. Specifically, Siponimod binding to S1PR2 led to altered side-chain dynamics of key TM7 residues (viz.Y7.37, F7.38, F7.39) and a drift of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) towards orientations observed in inactive state. These unique structural features differentiate Siponimod's behavior from S1P and explain its lack of inability to modulate S1PR2.

In fission yeast, defects in the cohesin loader Mis4 result in chromosome segregation defects and dysregulated expression of genes near chromosome ends. A genetic screen for suppressors of the thermosensitive growth defect of mis4-G1487D identified several hypomorphic mutants of the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1), a conserved kinase that integrates cellular signals to regulate growth and metabolism through substrate-specific phosphorylation. Here, we demonstrate that the TORC1 pathway modulates cohesin functions in chromosome segregation and gene expression. In the context of compromised cohesin loading, the incidence of chromosome segregation defects was modulated by the growth medium in a TORC1-dependent manner. Pharmacological or genetic down-regulation of TORC1 activity restored cohesin binding to its chromosomal sites and improved mitotic chromosome segregation. Notably, reduced TORC1 activity also increased cohesin binding and chromosome transmission fidelity in wild-type cells. These results suggest that environmental cues influence chromosome stability via TORC1. Biochemically, TORC1 co-purified with cohesin and reduced TORC1 activity correlated with decreased phosphorylation of specific residues on Mis4 and cohesin. Mutations in cohesin that mimic the non-phosphorylated state mirrored the effects of TORC1 downregulation, showing that TORC1 is part of the network that controls cohesin phosphorylation to modulate its functions. Finally, we show that the functional interaction between TORC1 and Mis4 extends to the regulation of stress-responsive genes. Our findings reveal a TORC1-cohesin link that may facilitate cellular adaptation to environmental changes. Given that TORC1 inhibitors and calorie restriction extend lifespan in diverse species, this connection raises the intriguing possibility that cohesin-mediated changes in chromosome structure contribute to these effects.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

However, existing gradient flow learning methods cannot analyze spatially resolved transcriptomic data. Here, we propose STORIES, a method that employs an extension of Optimal Transport to learn a spatially informed potential. We benchmark our approach using three large Stereo-seq spatiotemporal atlases and demonstrate superior spatial coherence compared to existing approaches.

Animals searching for food must navigate complex landscapes with varying terrain, food availability, predator activity, and shelter. Where and when should they gather food? To what extent should they engage in anti-predator behaviors such as vigilance or seeking refuge if a predator is detected? Optimal foraging theory (OFT) posits that animals balance potentially conflicting goals (such as feeding versus escaping predation) by making decisions that maximize some expected utility or reward. However, OFT models have generally considered highly simplified landscapes, either ignoring spatial variability or assuming that the habitat consists of discrete, internally uniform habitat patches. As a result, OFT has largely avoided the question of how animals should move from one potential feeding area to another, or between feeding areas and refuges. 2. We develop methods based on stochastic dynamic programming to find optimal foraging strategies, including optimal movement paths, in a continuous landscape with spatially varying predation risk. Our approach accounts for switching from foraging to escape behavior when pursued by a predator. Because contingent escape paths are considered for all visited locations, they influence the optimal foraging path even before threats are encountered. The optimal strategy thus depends on the animal's level of hunger, the distribution of food, and the perceived threat distribution. The realized path is further influenced by actual predator encounters. 3. We illustrate our approach with two numerical examples: the first hypothetical with two food-abundant regions accessible only via high-risk areas, the second based on empirical studies on foraging Samango monkeys, Cercopithecus albogularis schwarzi. We find that the shape of the forager's utility function (risk-averse, risk-neutral, or with state-dependent risk sensitivity) affects not only its choices of where to feed, but also the optimal paths to and from each feeding ground. 4. Our methods make it possible to compare properties of observed foraging trajectories with those predicted for different goal functions. Foraging trajectories can then provide additional information, along with other behavioral choices, about what quantity, if any, animals aim to optimize while foraging.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Recent studies suggest that state representation and state value can be simultaneously learnt through Temporal-Difference-Reinforcement-Learning (TDRL) and Backpropagation-Through-Time (BPTT) in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their readout. However, neural implementation of such learning remains unclear as BPTT requires offline update using transported downstream weights, which is suggested to be biologically implausible. We demonstrate that simple online training of RNNs using TD reward prediction error and random feedback, without additional memory or eligibility trace, can still learn the structure of tasks with cue-reward delay and timing variability. This is because TD learning itself is a solution for temporal credit assignment, and feedback alignment, a mechanism originally proposed for supervised learning, enables gradient approximation without weight transport. Furthermore, we show that biologically constraining downstream weights and random feedback to be non-negative not only preserves learning but may even enhance it because the non-negative constraint ensures loose alignment - allowing the downstream and feedback weights to roughly align from the beginning. These results provide insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the learning of state representation and value, highlighting the potential of random feedback and biological constraints.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Inhibitory synapses are key regulators of the functional balance of neural circuits. However, due to the diversity of inhibitory presynaptic neurons, the complex composition of postsynaptic receptor subunits and the lack of typical postsynaptic dense structure, there are relatively few studies on the regulatory mechanisms for inhibitory synaptic structure and function, and insufficient understanding of the cellular and molecular abnormalities of inhibitory synapses in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we report a crucial role for endophilin A1 in inhibitory synapses. We show that endophilin A1 directly interacts with the inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin in excitatory neurons, and promotes organization of the inhibitory postsynaptic density and synaptic recruitment/stabilization of the {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type A receptors via its plasma membrane association and actin polymerization promoting activities. Loss of endophilin A1 by gene knockout in mouse hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells weakens inhibitory synaptic transmission and causes imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory function of neural circuits, leading to increased susceptibility to epilepsy. Our findings identify endophilin A1 as an iPSD component and provide new insights into the organization and stabilization of inhibitory postsynapses to maintain E/I balance as well as the pathogenesis of epilepsy.\n\nKey words: endophilin A1, E/I balance, epilepsy, GABAAR, gephyrin, inhibitory synapse", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

We characterized short-term plasticity at the local excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 of the rat medial prefrontal cortex and studied its presynaptic mechanisms. Low-frequency stimulation induced slowly developing facilitation, whereas high-frequency stimulation initially induced strong depression followed by rapid facilitation. This non-monotonic delayed facilitation after a brief depression resulted from a high vesicular fusion probability and slow activation of Ca2+-dependent vesicle replenishment, which led to the overfilling of release sites beyond their basal occupancy. Pharmacological and gene knockdown (KD) experiments revealed that the facilitation was mediated by phospholipase C/diacylglycerol signaling and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7). Notably, Syt7 KD abolished facilitation and slowed the refilling rate of vesicles with high fusion probability. Furthermore, Syt7 deficiency in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos activity. In conclusion, Ca2+- and Syt7-dependent overfilling of release sites mediates synaptic facilitation at L2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses and contributes to temporal associative learning.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

We then released the bats into the wild and tracked their foraging using GPS. Bats that had experienced an enriched environment during early life displayed increasing boldness and exploratory behavior when foraging outdoors, demonstrating how early-life experience can affect adult behavior.

Interaction niches are intimately related to the notion of trait matching, which posits that a species interacts preferentially with partners whose traits are complementary to their own. Multivariate methods are commonly used to quantify species environmental niches (or Grinnellian niches). More recently, some of these methods have also been used to study the interaction niche, but they consider only the niche optimum and require trait data. In this article, we use the correspondence analysis (CA) framework to study interaction networks and investigate trait matching without requiring trait data, using the notion of latent traits. We use reciprocal scaling, a method related to CA, to estimate niche optima and breadths, defined respectively as the mean and standard deviation of the latent traits of species' interacting partners. We present the method, test its performance using a simulation model we designed, and analyze a real frugivory network between birds and plants. The simulation study shows that the method is able to recover niche breadths and optima for data generated with parameters typical of ecological networks. The birds-plants network analysis shows strong relationships between species latent traits and niche breadths: a posteriori correlation with measured traits suggests that birds and plants of intermediate size tend to have the broadest niches. Additionally, birds preferentially foraging in the understory have broader niches than birds preferentially foraging in the canopy. CA and reciprocal scaling are described as fruitful exploratory methods to characterize species interaction profiles, provide an ecologically meaningful graphical representation of interaction niches, and explore the effect of latent traits on network structure.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

We test the efficacy of NewtCap, originally designed for the Eurasian Triturus newts, in 30 species, belonging to 17 different genera, that cover all main Salamandridae lineages.

Mitochondrial genome damage, particularly DNA strand breaks, is a potential cause for its compromised functionality. Here we show that the activity of polynucleotide kinase 3-phosphatase (PNKP), a critical DNA end-processing enzyme, is significantly decreased in the mitochondrial extract of HD patients brains due to a lower level of fructose-2,6 bisphosphate (F2,6BP), a biosynthetic product of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3). Such decrease in PNKP activity leads to persistent DNA strand breaks that are refractory to subsequent steps for repair completion. Both PFKFB3 and F2,6BP, an allosteric modulator of glycolysis, are also present in the mitochondria and PFKFB3 is part of a mitochondrial DNA repair complex containing HTT, PNKP, DNA Pol {gamma} (POLG) and Lig III. Notably, PNKP binds F2,6BP (Kd= 525 nM) and utilizes it as a cofactor. The levels of both F2,6BP and PFKFB3 are significantly decreased in the mitochondrial extract of HD mouse striatal neuronal cells and patients brain. Activity of PNKP is thus severely decreased in the mitochondrial extract; however, addition of F2,6BP restored its activity. Moreover, supplementation of F2,6BP in HD cells restored PFKFB3 level, mitochondrial genome integrity and partially restored mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial respiration and prevented pathogenic aggregate formation. We also observed that supplementation with F2,6BP restored mitochondrial genome integrity in an HD Drosophila model. Our findings, therefore, suggest that F2,6BP-mediated restoration of PNKP activity could have a profound impact in ameliorating neurodegenerative symptoms in HD.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Exercise initiated during but not after blastema establishment compromised fin regeneration, including outgrowth and skeletal pattern. Long-term tracking of fluorescently labeled fibroblasts showed exercise loading disrupted blastemal mesenchyme formation. Transcriptomic profiling and section staining indicated loading reduced an extracellular matrix (ECM) gene expression program, including for hyaluronic acid (HA) synthesis. As with exercise loading, HA synthesis inhibition or blastemal HA depletion impaired blastema formation. We considered if injury-upregulated HA establishes a pro-regenerative environment facilitating mechanotransduction. HA density across the blastema correlated with nuclear localization of the mechanotransducer Yes-associated protein (Yap). Exercise loading or HA depletion decreased nuclear Yap, and culturing primary fin fibroblasts on HA-coated surfaces induced Yap nuclear localization. We conclude early exercise during fin regeneration disrupts expression of an HA-rich ECM supporting Yap-promoted blastema expansion.

Regardless of whether one or multiple verniers are shown, only a single offset is perceived. Postdictive phenomena offer a unique opportunity to study the neural correlates of unconscious and conscious stages of perception because unconscious and conscious processing are well separated in time. Here, using EEG recordings during the SQM, we identified two distinct stages of neural activity. Early occipital EEG activity patterns (~200 ms after the initial vernier presentation) capture unconscious processing, while later centro-parietal EEG patterns (~400-600 ms after the onset of the stimulus stream) are associated with conscious perception, aligning with behavioral results.

Transcription factors (TFs) being key to genetic regulation, have been studied in the origins of eusociality in Hymenoptera (bees, ants and wasps) but less so in Blattodea (cockroaches and termites). Here we show that the social transition in Blattodea, from cockroaches to termites, displays similar patterns of regulatory change to those found in Hymenoptera. Specifically, by analysing 3 cockroach and 5 termite genomes, we find more TF families with relaxed selection compared to intensified selection and lineage-specific gene family expansions in termites, which has also been reported in Hymenoptera. We also find that genes under selection support neotenic caste determination. We find there are key differences in Blattodea TF regulation in comparison with Hymenoptera with contractions in TF gene families and no compensatory change in TF DNA binding motifs either in frequency or diversity in TF promoter regions. Furthermore, we show that an increase in social complexity leads to greater diversity in TF activating domains, one of the evolutionary and structural building blocks of TFs, meanwhile, DNA-binding domains, undergo very little change. This study highlights similarities in social transitions between Hymenoptera and Blattodea, with evidence of large changes in transcriptional regulation followed by lineage specific adaptations.

Optogenetic inhibition of primary sensory regions determined short and long-term dampening of the sensory response across a distributed cortical network. Introduction: Many fundamental processes of brain computation, such as sensory perception and motor control, heavily rely on the mesoscopic dynamics of activity across the cerebral cortex. Manipulating mesoscale activity and observing its effects across multiple brain regions is crucial for understanding the causal link between cortical dynamics and behavior. Objective: The goal of this study was to develop a novel all-optical system that allows inhibition of excitatory neurons while simultaneously monitoring cortical responses at arbitrary sites across the entire dorsal cortex of mice. Methods: We combined wide-field imaging and optogenetics to create a mesoscale all-optical approach, enabling simultaneous monitoring and manipulation of cortical activity using light. Intravenous injection of two PHP.eB AAVs enabled the whole-brain co-expression of the red-shifted calcium indicator jRCaMP1b and the inhibitory actuator stGtACR2, with stable expression over several weeks. This system was calibrated, and the effects of inhibition on sensory responses were tested. Results: Increasing laser power progressively reduced spontaneous activity at the site of irradiation. A single 5-second pulse on the barrel field cortex significantly decreased the amplitude of sensory-evoked responses, not only in the stimulated region but across the entire stimulated hemisphere. Conclusions: This novel all-optical system enables targeted inhibition while concurrently monitoring mesoscale cortical activity. It provides insights into the dynamics of cortical circuits and offers a milestone for investigating the causal links between neuronal activity and behavior.

The discordance between the compact static chromatin organization (structure) and the relaxation times (dynamics) is a conundrum that violates the expected structure-function relationship. To resolve the puzzle, we developed a theory to predict chromatin dynamics by first calculating the accurate three-dimensional (3D) structure using static Hi-C contact maps or fixed-cell imaging data. The calculated 3D coordinates are used to accurately forecast the two-point dynamics reported in recent experiments that simultaneously monitor chromatin dynamics and transcription. Strikingly, the theory not only predicts the observed fast enhancer-promoter dynamics but also reveals a novel scaling relationship between two-point relaxation time and genomic separation that is in near quantitative agreement with recent experiments. The theory also predicts that cohesin depletion enhances single-locus diffusion. The acceleration of chromatin loci diffusion upon cohesin depletion are explained in terms of structure-based centrality measure used in graph theory. Our framework shows that chromatin dynamics can be predicted based solely on static experimental data, reinforcing the concept that the three-dimensional structure determines their dynamic behavior. The generality of the theory opens new avenues for exploring chromatin dynamics, especially transcriptional dynamics, across different biological contexts.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Perturbations of single ASD genes caused the widespread dysregulation of other ASD genes, and de novo reconstruction of gene regulatory networks uncovered the prominent autism risk gene CHD8 as a critical driver of this transcriptomic convergence. The transcriptional activator ZFX, which escapes X chromosome inactivation in females, was also identified as a key regulator of ASD genes, revealing genetic underpinnings of the female protective effect.

While natural proteins have finely tuned affinities for their primary ligands, they also bind weakly and promiscuously to other molecules, which serve as starting points for stepwise, incremental evolution of entirely new specificities.

The ability of natural proteins to bind small molecule fragments in well-defined geometries has been widely evaluated using methods including crystallographic fragment screening. However, this approach had not been applied to de novo proteins. Here, we apply this method to explore the binding specificity of a de novo small molecule-binding protein ABLE. As in Nature, we found ABLE was capable of forming weak complexes, which were excellent starting points for designing entirely new functions, including a binder of a turn-on fluorophore and a highly efficient Kemp eliminase enzyme (kcat/KM = 2,200,000 M-1s-1) approaching the diffusion limit.

Consequently, oncolytic approaches with recombinant vaccinia viruses have emerged as attractive agents against ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, oncolytic vaccinia monotherapies are yet to live up to their potential promise. Given this, there is a need to identify combination agents that improve the effectiveness of vaccinia in ovarian cancer treatment. We screened 9,000 compounds to identify drugs that enhance the ability of a recombinant vaccinia virus lacking VGF and F1 ({Delta}VF) to induce death of ID8 Trp53-/- murine ovarian cancer cells. We identified a class of tubulin polymerisation inhibitors including vinorelbine. The combination of vinorelbine and vaccinia induces ID8 Trp53-/- cell death via apoptosis. In a syngeneic mouse model of high grade serous ovarian carcinoma, {Delta}VF virus lacking the viral thymidine kinase (TK), armed with GM-CSF and expressing NeonGreen ({Delta}VFTK-NG-GM-CSF) is tumour specific. A combination of the {Delta}VFTK-NG-GM-CSF virus with vinorelbine prolongs mouse survival compared to the treatment of mice with either agent alone.

B.; Lutti, A.", "abstract": "Purpose: Maps of the MRI parameters R2* and magnetic susceptibility ({chi}) enable the investigation of microscopic tissue changes in brain disease. However, cardiac-induced signal instabilities increase the variability of brain maps of R2* and {chi}. In this study, we introduce ISME - a sampling strategy that minimizes the level of cardiac-induced instabilities in brain maps of R2* and {chi}. Methods: ISME uses phase-encoding gradients to shift the k-space frequency of the acquired data between consecutive readouts of a multi-echo train. As a result, the multi-echo data at a given k-space index is acquired at different phases of the cardiac cycle. We compare the variability of R2* and {chi} maps acquired with ISME and with standard multi-echo trajectories in N=10 healthy volunteers. We investigate the effect of both trajectories on the spatial aliasing of pulsating MR signals and propose a weighted-least squares (NWLS) approach for the estimation of R2* that accounts for the increase of the residuals with echo time. Results: ISME reduces the variability of R2* and {chi} maps across repetitions by 25/26/21% and 24/32/23% in the cerebellum/brainstem/whole brain, respectively. With ISME, the spatial aliasing of pulsating MR signals is incoherent between raw echo images, leading to visually sharper R2* maps. The proposed NWLS approach for the estimation of R2* reduces the dependence of the fitting residuals on echo time and the variability of R2* by an additional 3/2/1% in the cerebellum/brainstem/whole brain. Conclusion: ISME allows the mitigation of cardiac-induced signal instabilities in brain maps of R2* and {chi}, improving reproducibility.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

While the mechanisms underlying transitive learning have been well studied, the dynamics of the decision making process during learning and inference remain less clearly understood. In this study, we investigated whether a modeling framework traditionally applied to perceptual decision-making, the drift diffusion model (DDM), can account for performance in a TI transfer task involving rapid decisions that deviate from standard accuracy and response time (RT) patterns. We trained three macaque monkeys on a TI transfer task, in which they learned the implied order of a novel list of seven images in each behavioral session. Monkeys indicated their decisions with saccadic eye movements. Consistent learning of the list structure was achieved within 200 to 300 trials per session, with asymptotic accuracies reaching approximately 80 to 90%. Behavioral performance exhibited a symbolic distance effect, with accuracy increasing as the ordinal distance between items grew. Notably, RTs remained relatively stable across learning, despite improvements in accuracy. We applied a generalized DDM implementation (PyDDM; Shinn et al., 2020) to jointly fit accuracy and RT data. Model fits were achieved by incorporating both an increasing evidence accumulation rate and a collapsing decision bound, successfully capturing the RT distribution shapes observed during learning. These findings suggest that decision-making during serial learning and transfer in a TI task can be characterized by a \"variable collapsing bound\" DDM. Our results highlight a distinct dynamical regime of the DDM framework, extending its applicability to cognitive domains involving symbolic reasoning and serial relational learning.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

However, a data-driven understanding of behavior and its modulation in solitary and social contexts is lacking. In this study, we employed motion sequencing (MoSeq) to decompose mouse behaviors into discrete units (Syllables) and investigate whether, and how, the behavioral repertoire differs between solitary and dyadic (social) settings. Our results reveal that social context significantly modulates a minority (25%) of syllables, containing predominantly stationary and undirected behaviors. Notably, these changes are associated with spatial proximity to another mouse rather than active social contact. Interestingly, a network analysis of syllable transitions shows that context-sensitive syllables exhibit altered network influence, independent of the number of connected syllables, suggesting a regulatory role. Furthermore, syllable composition changes significantly during social contact events with two distinct sequence families governing approach and withdrawal behaviors.

The nose-to-brain (N-2-B) pathway offers a promising alternative, enabling pharmacological agents to circumvent the BBB. However, to date, no drugs have been successfully implemented in clinical settings for the treatment of AD via this route, underscoring the necessity for additional research in this area. Mild stress is thought to activate intrinsic protective mechanisms against neurodegeneration, but traditional methods of inducing stress often lack both specificity and practicality. To address this limitation, we propose the inhalation of mildly heated air as a form of thermal stimulation, which utilizes the N-2-B pathway to induce mild stress and stimulate cerebral activity. This study employs the method of thermal cycling-hyperthermia (TC-HT) technique [Chao C.Y. et al., U.S. patent 11753634, 2023 & Chao C.Y. et al., U.S. patent Appl.

In this study, we assessed the health and olfactory effects of TCSNI in C57BL/6 mice and found no adverse effects. In experimental groups administered with {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}), TCSNI treatment resulted in significant enhancements in cognitive performance as evidenced by Y-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) assessments, suggesting an improvement in cognitive function. Protein analyses conducted on the hippocampus of the mice indicated a reduction in A{beta} accumulation, alongside increased expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression, as well as elevated levels of phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt).

However, how these formed neuronal ensembles maintain their stability, and whether the disturbed stability contributes to aging-related memory deficits remain elusive. Here, we show that neuronal pentraxin1 (NPTX1) facilitates Kv7.2-mediated inhibition of Fos+ ensemble hyperexcitability, thereby restricting its response to excitatory inputs from medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) and promoting memory expression in the fear context. Meanwhile, NPTX2 facilitates the perisomatic inhibition of the Npas4+ ensemble by parvalbumin+ (PV+) interneurons, thus preventing fear memory overgeneralization. Pharmacological activation of Kv7.2 or chemogenetic activation of PV+ interneurons repaired memory deficits caused by engram specific NPTXs depletion. Contextual fear memory precision and NPTXs expression in dentate gyrus (DG) engram cells are decreased in aged mice. Overexpression of NPTX1 in Fos+ ensemble or AMPAR binding domain of NPTX2 in Npas4+ ensemble rescued memory imprecision.

Within this region, atrophy is most prominent in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), a group of posteriorly clustered magnocellular neurons in the BFCS. However, less is known surrounding the relationship between amyloid deposition, BFCS atrophy, and medial temporal lobe (MTL) volume loss in the preclinical stages of AD. The current study investigates the relationship between sub-structural BFCS volume and cortical amyloid-beta burden in cognitively unimpaired middle-aged individuals at varying genetic risk for AD. Methods: Cognitively unimpaired participants aged 50-65 with a first-degree family history for AD were genetically screened to select three groups: APOE genotype e3e3 (n=15), e3e4 (n=15), and e4e4 (n=15), matched for age and sex. Participants underwent imaging with [11C]PiB PET and structural 3T MRI. Distribution volumes ratios (DVR) with a whole cerebellum reference region were calculated for [11C]PiB PET analyses. BFCS sub-structural volumes were obtained from the SPM8 Anatomy Toolbox (Cholinergic nuclei [Ch] 1-3, Ch4). MTL subregional volumes (entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal gyrus) were extracted using Freesurfer. Results: BFCS amyloid burden was highest among APOE e4 homozygotes (Ch1-3, F(2, 42)=3.26, P=0.048; Ch4, F(2, 42)=3.82, P= 0.03). Ch4 (nbM), but not Ch1-3 volume, was found to be inversely associated with global amyloid-beta burden (Pearson r=-0.40, P=0.007). MTL subregional volumes were not associated with global amyloid-beta burden in the pooled sample. Exploratory analyses in groups stratified by amyloid positivity demonstrated reduced Ch4 volume (P=0.032) and significant inverse associations between Ch4 volume and amyloid burden (Pearson r = -0.70, P=0.02) in amyloid+ participants. Conclusions: We observed nbM (Ch4), but not MTL volume, to be significantly inversely associated with cortical amyloid burden in cognitively unimpaired, amyloid+, middle-aged adults at varying genetic risk for AD.

Collective neuronal activities, such as neural avalanches and synchronized oscillations, are also found under rest conditions, and these features have been suggested to support sensory processing, brain readiness for rapid responses, and computational efficiency. The rat barrel cortex and thalamus circuit, with its somatotopic organization for processing whisker movements, provides a powerful system to explore such interplay. To characterize these resting state circuits, we perform simultaneous multi-electrode recordings in rats' barrel cortex and thalamus. During spontaneous activity, oscillations with frequencies centered around 11.5 Hz are detected concomitantly with slow oscillations below 4 Hz, as well as power-law distributed avalanches. The phase of the lower-frequency oscillation appears to modulate the higher-frequency amplitude, and it has a role in gating avalanche occurrences. We then record neural activity during controlled whisker movements to confirm that the 11.5 Hz barrel circuit active at rest is indeed the one involved in response to whisker stimulation. We finally show how a thalamic-driven firing-rate model can describe the entire phenomenology observed at resting state and predict the response of the barrel cortex to controlled whisker movement.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

We find that reversible ATP-dependent dimerization is required for MORC2 accumulation over L1s but not gene promoters. Engineered mutations of the MORC2 ATPase module severely disrupts the distribution of MORC2 chromatin binding, leading to simultaneous loss of L1 transcriptional control and hyper-repression of clustered ZNF genes in human pluripotent stem cells.

Invasive animal studies have demonstrated that vasomotor activity contributes to coherent blood oxygenation-dependent level (BOLD) signal fluctuations. However, in humans, it remains challenging to non-invasively detect this contribution due to the limited spatiotemporal sensitivity of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to vasomotion. Leveraging internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS) as a natural lesion model of impaired vasomotion, we examined whether impaired vasomotor activity influences inter-hemispheric BOLD coherence at ~0.1 Hz. Using a multi-modal fMRI framework that integrates resting-state fMRI with quantitative multi-parametric mapping of cerebral blood volume, blood flow, oxygen metabolism, and BOLD time lag, we compared BOLD coherence in patients with unliteral ICAS to healthy controls. Frequency-specific coherence analysis revealed significantly diminished inter-hemispheric BOLD coherence at the vasomotor frequency range (~0.1 Hz) across canonical resting-state networks in ICAS patients, whereas ultra-slow (<0.05 Hz) coherence remains largely preserved. This reduction was spatially widespread and particularly pronounced inside watershed areas, i.e., border zones between major vascular perfusion territories that are especially vulnerable to hypoperfusion, and associated with a significantly increased lateralization in cerebral blood volume (p < 0.01) inside watershed areas. Notably, coherence-based FC patterns at ~0.1 Hz were heterogeneous inside watershed areas and homogeneous outside watershed areas, suggesting an interplay between compensatory mechanisms and vasomotion impairment. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that frequency-resolved, region-specific analysis can capture presumably vasomotion-related oscillatory signals at ~0.1 Hz and detect subtle differences in inter-hemispheric FC, offering a non-invasive biomarker for early cerebrovascular dysfunction, particularly in patients with ICAS and other vasomotion-related neuropathologies.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

However, a general understanding of how changes in temperature and pH may universally impact protein evolution is lacking. Moreover, while pH is locally regulated in the different microbial compartments (e.g. periplasm, cytoplasm), temperature is not. A priori, these variables should act at different rates over evolutionary timescales with respect to genome evolution, since there are genes encoding for proteins allocated in different compartments. To test whether this is true, we can use a proxy for the number of evolutionary events (e.g. mutations, duplications, etc.). One simple yet unregarded way is to calculate the diversity of unique sequences assigned to a biochemical function (KEGG) across species. Given similar diversity of species in particular environments, the expectation for any KEGG is to be represented by a similar number of sequences. We can give answer to the question comparing this metric between metastable communities with differential values of temperature and pH. In this work, we examine the sequence diversity among 17 metagenomes from El Tatio geothermal field (Chile), spanning temperatures of 45-62{degrees}C, and pH values of 7.2-9.3. We found that, when controlling for abundance, higher temperature (>56{degrees}C) increases, while basic pH (>8.1) decreases the expected by-function diversity. The inclusion of these variables improved the prediction of sequence diversity from metagenomic abundance. Between-compartment diversity was more affected by pH than by temperature. Protein length distributions and individual, well-known taxa from hydrothermal springs showed compatible trends. Overall, our results suggest that sequence diversity is universally governed by the signature buffering of the stable compartments to some of the outside-cell factors, besides the taxonomic trends or the particularities of any function. Altogether, we provide evidence against the temperature-induced gene loss hypotheses, and in favor of the confined evolution hypothesis.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

This study investigates how the Mucor circinelloides species complex adapts to the antifungal natural product FK506. In Mucor bainieri, most resistant strains exhibit unstable phenotypes without genetic changes. Approximately ~50% of FK506-resistant isolates acquire resistance via RNAi-dependent epimutation, where small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) silence fkbA transcription. The remaining isolates undergo heterochromatin-mediated silencing via H3K9 methylation and siRNAs spreading, repressing fkbA and neighboring genes. One isolate retained only heterochromatin marks without detectable siRNAs. A similar mechanism operates in Mucor atramentarius, where FK506 resistance is mediated by ectopic heterochromatin associated with siRNA. Strikingly, heterochromatin-based epimutation inheritance remains stable following in vivo infection. These findings reveal that antifungal resistance can arise through distinct, heritable epigenetic pathways involving RNAi, heterochromatin, or both highlighting adaptive strategies employed by ubiquitous eukaryotic microbial pathogens infecting humans.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

We reveal that the interplay between homotypic and heterotypic interactions among DNA, RNA and peptides dictates the formation of multiphase condensates. Leveraging this mechanism, we design a library of sequence-specific oligonucleotides, termed SEGREGamers, that enable programmable multiphase droplets with coexisting DNA-rich and RNA-rich domains. These synthetic condensates recapitulate key features of cellular nuclear compartments, including selective partitioning of small molecules, promotion of RNA aptamer folding, and enhancement of catalytic RNA cleavage.

We found that hypoxia reduced NK cell cytotoxicity, mitochondrial content, and membrane potential, while increasing mtROS and inducing broad transcriptional changes in metabolic and stress response pathways. CAR engineering with CD70 and IL-15, while designed to enhance persistence and metabolic fitness, did not prevent hypoxia-induced impairment. Given the mitochondrial disruption, we then explored whether DRP1 ablation could mitigate hypoxia-induced dysfunction. Pharmacological inhibition of DRP1 restored mitochondrial content and cytotoxic function. To confirm the role of DRP1, we generated CRISPR-Cas9-mediated DRP1 KO NK cells, which preserved mitochondrial load and membrane potential under hypoxia.

We present a computational framework integrating AlphaFold3-predicted structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 3 subunit (nAChR-3) with multi-force-field molecular dynamics (MD) refinements to design peptide biopesticides. Crucially, we introduce \"Dipeptide Probing\", a high-throughput MD-based screening strategy employing 20 phenylalanine-containing dipeptides (F-X) to map dynamic binding sites. Unlike rigid docking or static free energy calculations, this approach captures transient interactions and cooperative binding phenomena, identifying Phe-Met (FM) as the top binder through hydrophobic contacts and multiple hydrogen bonding, while {pi}-stacking contributed minimally to complex stability, contradicting conventional paradigms. Additionally, MD simulations revealed an unexpected Aggregation-Induced Hydrophobicity Binding (AIHB) mechanism: FM dipeptides self-assemble via hydrogen bonds, orienting hydrophilic groups toward solvent and exposing hydrophobic surfaces to the target, thereby stabilizing complex formation to the helix bundle surface of nAChR-3. This cooperative behavior, undetectable by docking (e.g., AutoDock Vina failed to predict FM binding) or static energy methods, resolves limitations of reductionist approaches.

Here we test the efficacy of the short-chain fatty acid sodium butyrate (NaB), known to be reduced with chronic opioid use, in mitigating POE-related deficits. Both methadone and sodium butyrate treatments disrupted dam and offspring microbiota composition and function: notably methadone altered dam microbial gene expression of critical enzymes for butyric acid production. Similar disruptions were observed in pups at postnatal day 21 but resolved in adulthood. POE induced anxiety in adolescence on the open-field test, and adult deficits in working spatial memory (TUNL task) and attentional processing (5-CSRTT), which were partially rescued in rats that had received prenatal NaB. NaB treatment mediated the impact of POE on reduced myelination. In summary, these results indicate that early treatment with NaB could significantly improve the outcomes of children born with POE.

Impairments in cerebral energy metabolism are increasingly recognized as central in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Elderly patients and patients with AD are also at elevated risk for perioperative neurological complications, including post-operative delirium and further cognitive deterioration. However, the interaction between metabolic vulnerability and anesthetic exposure remains incompletely understood. Methods: We investigated cortical metabolic responses and potassium homeostasis in acute brain slices from wild-type (WT) and AD-like APPPS1 transgenic mice, which were either exposed to isoflurane or left untreated. Glia cells were assessed by staining microglia and astrocytes. Measurements of the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), extracellular potassium dynamics, and proteomic profiling were integrated with computational modeling to assess oxidative metabolism and anesthetic effects under different conditions. Results: APPPS1 mice exhibited reduced CMRO2 and attenuated neuronal activity compared to age-matched WT controls, showing sex-specific differences. Proteomic analysis revealed the downregulation of key mitochondrial and glycolytic enzymes, indicating an impaired ATP-generating capacity. Exposure to isoflurane further suppressed CMRO2, with a more pronounced effect in the APPPS1 brain tissue, while glia cells exhibited no acute changes. Additionally, isoflurane exacerbated deficits in extracellular potassium ([K]) clearance, highlighting impaired ion homeostasis under anesthetic challenge. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that AD-like pathology in APPPS1 mice is associated with a significant decline in oxidative metabolism and ATP availability. These deficits are exacerbated by anesthetic exposure, contributing to impaired potassium regulation. This suggests that diminished metabolic flexibility may underlie increased anesthetic vulnerability and postoperative complications in AD.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Oligodendrocytes (OLs), which are responsible for repairing WMI, also suffer severe death resulting from the compression of hematoma and secondary neuroinflammation after ICH. Sephin1, a selective inhibitor of PPP1R15A, has been shown to reduce general protein synthesis and protect OLs by prolonging the integrated stress response (ISR). We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Sephin1 in protecting OLs in experimental ICH mice and primary OLs and microglia co-cultures. Methods: We first determined the performance of ICH mice treated with Sephin1 or vehicle in multiple behavioral tests. To investigate dynamic changes in the number of OLs surrounding the hematoma after ICH, we labeled and tracked apoptotic, proliferating, and mature OLs using immunofluorescence staining. Results: Sephin1 treatment improved long-term neurological function after ICH, which was accompanied by a significant alleviation of WMI in the perihematomal region. Our data indicated that Sephin1 dramatically increased the population of OLs in the perihematomal region after ICH by inhibiting OL apoptosis and promoting OL proliferation. Moreover, Sephin1 treatment attenuated neuroinflammation after ICH by inhibiting microglial polarization to the M1 phenotype.

The underlying mechanisms linking this metabolic stress to stroke-induced brain injury remains unclear, and effective therapies are lacking. Methods: In a mouse model of acute hyperglycemic stroke, luminal disruption, blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage, neurological deficit, motor function, and mortality were evaluated. Vascular luminal glycocalyx and complement activation were assessed by immunostaining, with glycocalyx loss confirmed by electron microscopy. Complement C3's causal role was tested using C3 knockout mice and site-targeted inhibition with CR2-Crry. To enhance translational relevance, post-mortem human stroke and control brains were immunostained to assess the association between endothelial glycocalyx loss and vascular complement activation. In a separate stroke patient cohort, soluble complement activation products were measured in pre-thrombectomy plasma, and their predictive value for modified Rankin Scale (mRS) outcomes evaluated using elastic net regression. Results: Hyperglycemic stroke mice exhibited accelerated and more severe BBB breakdown, greater functional deficits, and higher mortality than normoglycemic controls, mirroring clinical observations. Acute hyperglycemia triggered rapid vascular luminal injury characterized by loss of endothelial luminal glycocalyx, luminal IgM/IgG deposition, and vascular complement C3 activation, leading to BBB disruption. This vascular luminal injury was corroborated in human stroke brain tissue. These luminal changes persisted despite glucose normalization and were exacerbated by reperfusion, driving injury into the brain parenchyma. Genetic and pharmacological approaches confirmed vascular complement activation as a causal driver of severe BBB disruption and poor outcomes. Importantly, site-targeted pharmacological inhibition of complement after reperfusion preserved BBB integrity and improved outcomes, defining a time-specific, luminal-directed strategy as a promising adjunct to thrombectomy. Notably, soluble complement activation markers in pre-thrombectomy stroke plasma predicted clinical outcomes, highlighting their potential as pre-intervention markers for patient stratification and tailored therapy. Conclusion: This study reframes acute hyperglycemic stroke as a vascular luminal disorder, establishing a novel Metabolic-Complement-Vascular (MCV) axis linking metabolic stress to endothelial luminal glycocalyx loss, vascular complement activation, and BBB breakdown in both mice and humans.

AMPARs are activated by the binding of the neurotransmitter glutamate (Glu), which opens the ion channel and allows the influx of Na+ and Ca2+ ions into the post-synaptic neuron, initiating signal transduction. Despite many efforts, a bona fide ion permeation pathway of both monovalent and divalent cations in AMPARs remains elusive. From analyzing our cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) map of an open calcium-permeable AMPAR (CP-AMPAR) ion channel, we identified potential sites vital to permeation of cations through the channel. To delineate mechanisms of permeation, we studied the channel with all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Both Na+ and Ca2+ ions are coordinated by an entry site at the top of the channel prior to entering the selectivity filter.

Its deficiency in mice results in early postnatal mortality and severe neurogenesis impairments. Despite its importance in physiology and pathophysiology, BOCT1's structure and transport mechanism remain elusive. Here, we integrate cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), functional assays, biochemical experiments, and molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the structure, substrate recognition, and transport mechanism of mouse BOCT1 (mBOCT1). The high-resolution cryo-EM structure reveals a distinctive N-terminal domain with a unique folding pattern dominated by a transmembrane loop atop TM6 (TML6), diverging from both known structures of SLC22 transporters and AlphaFold predictions. Notably, mBOCT1 functions as a high-capacity, low-affinity iron transporter independent of LCN2 binding. Iron transport is facilitated by a substrate gating mechanism involving TML6. These findings establish a structural basis for BOCT1's role as an independent iron transporter, enhancing our understanding of the transport mechanisms within major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters and providing new insights into brain iron homeostasis.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

The PopPK model was developed using therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data from adult PwCF who received a vancomycin loading dose followed by intermittent, continuous, or both infusion types for MRSA-related pulmonary exacerbations. A total of 212 samples were collected following 90 intermittent and 42 continuous infusions in 21 patients.

The estimated CL and volume of distribution were 4.05 L/h/70 kg and 22.5 L/70 kg, respectively. The model was used to predict the probability of target attainment (PTA) following a single intermittent loading dose (500-1500 mg) and continuous infusion (500-6000 mg) over 24 hours.

This study analyzed differences in external load, measured as Player Load, across various pitch types using a GPS-based wearable device. Additionally, the relationship between Player Load and ball velocity was examined. Methods: Four male collegiate Division I baseball players from China (age: 18.5 {+/-} 0.58 years, height: 181.00 {+/-} 6.83 cm, weight: 78.00 {+/-} 5.48 kg) participated in this study. External loads were collected for four pitch types, fastball, changeup, curveball, and slider, using a wearable sensor device that recorded six variables: Maximum Player Load (Max PL), Maximum Rotation (Max Rot), Pitching Hourly Velocity, and Percentage of Acceleration Change in the Three Axes (Up Load %, Side Load %, and Fwd Load %). A Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used to assess differences across pitch types, while stepwise multiple regression analyzed the impact of Player Load on pitching speed. Results: Significant differences were observed among pitch types for Max PL, Max Rot, Hourly Speed, Up Load %, and Fwd Load % (p<0.05), while Side Load % did not show a significant difference (p>0.05). Stepwise multiple regression indicated that pitching speed was influenced by Max PL, with the equation: mph = 78.816 + 7.001 Max PL, R2 = 0.192, suggesting that Max PL accounted for 19.2% of the variability in pitching speed.

This study aimed to characterize both acute and chronic pathological changes following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) using iodine-enhanced micro-CT. Method Experimental ICH was induced in 8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice (n = 76) via stereotaxic injection of either 0.075 U collagenase IV or 30 l autologous blood. Iodine-enhanced micro-CT imaging was performed at 4 hours, 1, 3, and 7 days after intracerebral hemorrhage post-ICH to evaluate hematoma formation and erythrolysis. Chronic alterations, including ventriculomegaly and ipsilateral lesion, were assessed at 28 days post-ICH. In parallel, MRI was conducted at 1, 7, and 28 days following autologous blood injection, followed by micro-CT, to facilitate cross-modality quantitative analysis. Lesion volumes were compared between imaging modalities over time. Results Micro-CT enabled quantification of hematoma volume and erythrolysis in ICH models. Hematomas extended along perivascular pathways toward the cerebral surface in both collagenase- and autologous blood- induced ICH models. At 28 days post-ICH, micro-CT detected ventriculomegaly and hypodense lesions without concurrent expansion of the choroid plexus. Lesion volume measurements derived from micro-CT correlated with those from MRI, enabling quantitatively assessment of iron deposition and hematoma size alterations after ICH.

Gas fermentation reactors may benefit from biofilm formation, but cell attachment by acetogens is often limited. This study indeed found that the acetogen Sporomusa ovata 2663 was mainly planktonic and aimed to increase its biofilm formation through adaptive laboratory evolution. The adaptation strategy consisted of growing S. ovata on plastic carriers in bottles with a H2:CO2 headspace and transferring few carriers to bottles with fresh carriers over eight serial transfers. This procedure resulted in the evolved S. ovata 2663-BF, which had a consistent increased propensity to attach. In heterotrophic growth conditions, four times more cells attached to the bottom of well plates in comparison to the wild type. Moreover, twice as many cells adhered to carriers when grown on H2:CO2. This improved attachment, however, did not lead to higher acetate production rates in simple trickle bed reactors, as the used experimental setup likely stimulated planktonic growth due to a low trickling frequency. Only after some medium replacements to remove planktonic cells, higher gas consumption rates were recorded for the evolved culture. Interestingly, the evolved S. ovata had a relevant point mutation in the gene galU, encoding UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides. Overall, this study demonstrates that cell attachment by S. ovata was increased through adaptive laboratory evolution, offering the prospect of investigating the importance of biofilm formation in biofilm-based gas fermentation reactors.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Its particulate fraction, particulate organic matter (POM), serves as a resource and surface for microbial colonization. Degradation of complex biopolymers like cellulose and chitin requires extracellular enzymes produced by phylogenetically diverse microbes. Despite their importance for carbon cycling, the structure and spatio-temporal dynamics of particle-associated microbial communities in soil and how specific substrates influence them remain poorly understood. This study investigated whether microbial communities associated with POM change in composition and richness over time and whether chitin and cellulose select for distinct fungal and bacterial taxa. We incubated self-manufactured millimeter-sized model POM substrate particles containing chitin or cellulose in soil under laboratory and field conditions. Over 50 days, we assessed particle-associated bacterial and fungal communities at multiple time points in the lab and after 47 days in the field. Our results show that community structure and temporal dynamics of particle-associated microbial communities were substrate-specific. While microbial biomass increased on both particle types, chitin-associated microbial exhibited stronger temporal changes. Communities on chitin and cellulose particles were enriched in specific bacterial and fungal genera compared to communities in the surrounding soil. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that microbial communities associated with model chitin particles underwent notable temporal changes. More specifically, microbial richness decreased, and community composition shifted over the incubation period. Both chitin and cellulose particles favored certain fungal, and especially bacterial genera compared to surrounding soil.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we present an integrative study that combines classical machine learning and quantum-enhanced modeling to investigate how crystal structure resolution, sequence similarity, and ligand properties jointly influence binding affinity. Using a curated \"refined\" dataset from PDBbind and an expanded general dataset, we first conduct correlation and regression analyses to quantify the relationships among binding affinity, ligand descriptors (e.g., molecular weight, logP), and protein structural metrics (resolution, R-factor). We observe moderate positive correlations between ligand size/hydrophobicity and affinity, and a slight negative correlation between resolution and affinity in the refined dataset that largely disappears in the general set. We then train multiple predictive models, including random forests, deep neural networks, and quantum-enhanced approaches--quantum kernel methods, variational quantum circuits, and a hybrid classical-quantum neural network. Experimental results show that quantum-enhanced models perform on par with classical methods in predicting binding affinities and, in some cases, offer modest improvements. Notably, a hybrid quantum-classical model achieves the highest accuracy (Pearson correlation R{approx}0.80R) on the refined dataset. These findings highlight the potential of quantum computing for capturing complex patterns in biomolecular data, laying groundwork for improved structure-based drug design.

The light-sensitive photoreceptors detect light at varying wavelengths, activating signaling cascades and triggering a range of physiological responses. Rhodopsin is a transmembrane heptahelical protein that functions as an ion channel, or a pump, and sensory receptor, respectively. It consists of a light-sensing chromophore, a retinal that upon absorbing light, initiates a series of signaling pathways of sensory perception, growth and survival. Modular rhodopsin (Different from Rhodopsin-Cyclase Module) has been reported in lower eukaryotes, its identification, characterisation and functional significance in the Fungal Kingdom largely unknown. Here, we report the identification of novel modular rhodopsins in fungi, which highlights their potential usages towards the unexplored opto-biotechnological applications (e.g., biomanufacturing of terpenoids, cytoskeleton regulation, DNA metabolism, light-controlled acetyltransferase, etc.) simply by illumination. Furthermore, identification of novel modular rhodopsins augments the expansion of the new optogenetic tools for a wide range of relevant applications. The structural and homology analysis of these identified domains sheds light on their evolutionary lineage and relatedness with the well-characterised bacteriorhodopsin, sensory and channelrhodopsin.

This study investigates the metabolic reprogramming associated with Osi resistance, identifying key metabolic vulnerabilities that may be targeted for therapeutic intervention. Employing the EGFR-mutant H1975 parental (Par) cell line and its Osi-resistant (OsiR) counterpart, we integrated transcriptomics, metabolomics, nuclear and mitochondrial genomics, functional assays and bioanalytical techniques, as well as advanced 3D imaging to comprehensively define the resistant phenotype. We found that OsiR cells exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction, including impaired oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mitochondrial DNA mutations, and altered mitochondrial gene expression. To describe this systems-level characterization, we introduce the concept of mitochondromics, a comprehensive profiling of mitochondrial genomic, transcriptomic, structural, and functional changes contributing to therapeutic resistance. Metabolomic profiling revealed a significant accumulation of glycolytic intermediates (lactate, pyruvate, acetate, and acetaldehyde) in the extracellular medium, indicating a shift toward glycolysis and activation of alternative metabolic pathways, including the Warburg effect. Notably, we identified the pyruvate-acetaldehyde-acetate (PAA) pathway as a functionally repurposed metabolic route that facilitates NADPH production, which is critical for antioxidant defense and anabolic processes in OsiR cells. Additionally, although the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is not the primary source of NADPH in OsiR cells, it plays a supporting role in biosynthesis, contributing to the production of amino acids, nucleotides, and vitamins. Altered expression of enzymes involved in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and both oxidative and non-oxidative arms of the PPP further supports an adaptive metabolic network promoting cell growth and resistance to Osi. This study reveals a complex metabolic reprogramming in Osi-resistant EGFR-mutant NSCLC, where a newly identified role for the PAA pathway, alongside integrated mitochondromic alterations emerges as key driver of resistance. These insights uncover potential metabolic vulnerabilities of Osi-resistant tumors and provide a foundation for developing therapeutic strategies to counteract resistance and improve osimertinib efficacy.

We found that CD47 expression is associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC and explored the anti-tumor activity of CD47 blockade in combination with anti-PD1 and lymphatic-sparing radiotherapy in a locally advanced HNSCC model. Using the 4MOSC1 orthotopic, syngeneic murine model of HPV-negative HNSCC, treatment with an engineered CD47-blocking SIRP fusion protein (ALX301) similarly induced complete tumor regression in combination with anti-PD1, and a partial response as a standalone therapeutic.  An anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitor in a CD47-null tumor background led to complete tumor regression confirming a key role for CD47 in tumor immunity. Anti-CD47 treated mice demonstrated increased MHC-II expression on dendritic cells within the tumor and upregulation of CD86 co-stimulatory molecule on dendritic cells within the tumor, sentinel lymph nodes, and contralateral lymph nodes. Combination ALX301 and anti-PD1 treatment in an anti-PD1 resistant 4MOSC2 model demonstrated significant tumor regression, enhanced survivability, improved response with neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and greater retention of CD8+ T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, T-cell receptor sequencing revealed increased shared clonality between the tumor and sentinel lymph nodes of anti-CD47 treated mice. These data demonstrate that a combination of CD47 blockade and anti-PD1 therapy enhances tumor antigen presentation and immune cell infiltration, while further improving anti-tumor responses in combination with tumor-targeted radiotherapy. This study provides support for the rational design of combinatorial immunoradiotherapy, using anti-CD47 inhibitors and anti-PD1 therapy, in a clinical trial targeting locally advanced HPV-negative HNSCC.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Stimulation of trigger hairs located on the inner trap surface elicits an action potential (AP). While two consecutive APs result in fast trap closure in wildtype (WT) plants, sustained AP generation by the insect struggling to escape the trap leads to jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis, formation of the digestive stomach, and release of enzymes needed to decompose the victim. The Dionaea muscipula DYSCALCULIA (DYSC) mutant is able to fire touch-induced APs, but unlike WT plants, it does not snap-close its traps after two consecutive APs. Moreover, DYSC plants fail to properly initiate the JA pathway in response to mechanostimulation and even wounding, a well-known JA-dependent process conserved among plants. As demonstrated in previous studies, this DYSC mutant defect is associated with impaired decoding of mechanostimulation (i.e. touch) -induced Ca2+ signals. External JA application to the trap, however, restores slow trap closure and digestive gland function in DYSC, while rapid trap closure is JA-independent and cannot be rescued by exogenous JA application. Higher frequency mechanostimulation and thus more APs, however, revealed that DYSC is still able to close its traps, albeit much slower than WT plants. To reveal the molecular underpinnings of DYSCs delayed trap movement, we generated a chromosome scale Dionaea genome assembly and profiled gene expression. The refined transcriptomic analysis uncovered widespread misregulation of cell wall related genes in DYSC, implicating altered cell wall plasticity in the sluggish mutant. Cell indentation studies by atomic force microscopy revealed a strictly localized and strikingly enhanced stiffening of the cell wall for DYSC that may hinder rapid trap closure and snap buckling. Together, these genomic, transcriptomic, and biophysical data identify cell wall elasticity as a key constraint on voltage and Ca2+ dependent trap kinetics. This finding documents the interrelationship between mechanosensing and Ca2+ signaling in the ultrafast capture organ of the Venus flytrap.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

In the current work, we propose a novel generation based mathematical approach that approximates the metastatic process in terms of tumor age rather than size. Building on the seminal work of Iwata Kawasaki and Shigesada (IKS), we introduce a recursive integral approach that captures the hierarchical metastatic nature through successive generations, bypassing the need to solve complex partial differential equations as in the IKS model. We derive closed form solutions for the distribution of first generation of metastatic tumors, compute numerically higher order generations across generations, and validate our method against numerical solutions of the IKS transport equation. Our findings reveal that younger generations of metastases eventually dominate the overall tumor burden due to cumulative emissions, while older generations primarily contribute to the large size tail of the distribution. From the clinical perspective, the current approach provides a foundation for precise and personalized treatment strategies that can target distinct metastatic generations.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

The lysine methyltransferase SETD6 has been implicated in regulating transcription, cell adhesion, migration, and other processes in various cancers, however its role in melanoma remains unexplored. We recently reported that SETD6 mono-methylates the BRD4 at K99 to selectively regulate transcription of genes involved in mRNA translation. Here, we observed that BRD4 methylation at K99 by SETD6 occurs in melanoma cells. Knockout of SETD6 or a point mutation at BRD4-K99 disrupts BRD4 genomic occupancy. In addition, we show that SETD6 interacts with MITF, a master transcription factor in melanocytes and melanoma, and influences the genomic distribution of MITF. Mechanistically, we uncover a novel chromatin-localized interaction between BRD4 and MITF in melanoma. Our data suggest that BRD4 binds MITF in melanoma cells and that this interaction is dependent on both SETD6-mediated methylation of BRD4 and MITF acetylation. This chromatin complex plays a pivotal role in selective recruitment of BRD4 and MITF to different genomic loci in melanoma cells.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Focusing epigenetic sequencing on CpG-rich sequences, including CGIs and avoiding non-informative regions, offers an efficient and sensitive approach for cancer identification and tracking, especially within samples containing excess of unaltered, normal DNA. To this end, we have developed Adaptor-anchored Methylation amplification via Proximity Primers (aMAPP), a versatile PCR-based enrichment method. aMAPP employs specially designed primers to selectively enrich either methylated or unmethylated CpGs, depending on the upstream methylation conversion method employed. aMAPP achieves high coverage of genome-wide CGIs and detects hundreds of DMRs in tumor samples compared to adjacent normal tissue using ultra-low depth sequencing (~300,000 reads). It enables tracing of aberrant methylation down to allelic frequency 0.01% in dilutions of tumor DNA and in cell-free DNA samples, can be applied using picogram amounts of DNA, and can be adapted to enrich either small panels of cancer-specific DMRs, or the majority (>90%) of genomic CGIs and CpGs. aMAPP offers a simple, cost-effective, and highly sensitive approach for capturing the epigenetic footprint of genome-wide CpGs and identifying aberrantly methylated or un-methylated genomic regions.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

They are identified in a genome-wide manner by analyzing the binding of transcription factors (TFs), various co-factors and histone modifications in DNA using assays such as ChIP-seq, Cut&Tag and ATAC-seq. However, these assays are descriptive and require high-throughput technologies, such as massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), to test the functional activity and variant effect on these sequences. Currently, technologies that can simultaneously analyze both the regulatory function of a specific sequence and the TFs, cofactors and epigenomic modifications that determine it do not exist. Here, we developed enrichment followed by epigenomic profiling MPRA (e2MPRA), a novel technology that utilizes lentivirus-based MPRA to enrich for the integration of specific CREs into the genome followed by Cut&Tag or ATAC-seq targeted specifically for these sequences. This method allows to simultaneously analyze in a high-throughput manner regulatory activity, protein binding and epigenetic modification of thousands of candidate CREs and their variants. We demonstrate that e2MPRA can be used to dissect the epigenetic functions of TF motifs arranged in synthetic enhancers, as well as to analyze the effect of enhancer sequence variants on epigenetic modifications.

Targeting and removing senescent and cancerous cells using a combination of chemotherapeutic and senolytic drugs may reduce systemic inflammation, improve therapeutic efficacy, and prevent metastasis. Treatment of both triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells, and primary spine osteoblasts 0.25 uM Doxorubicin showed significant induction of senescence indicated by p21 positive cells. Doxorubicin and senolytics (RG-7112, o-Vanillin) treatment of mono-culture and co-culture spheroids showed a significant additive effect on decreased tumor sphere viability and growth. This was correlated with decreased p21 and Ki67 proliferation marker in both the breast cancer and osteoblast cells. In all cases, combined Doxorubicin and senolytics significantly reduced sphere size and cancer cell outgrowth, indicating reduced metastatic potential.

Here, we identify that KSHV hijacks the pioneering function of the endothelial-specific transcription factor SOX18 to facilitate persistence of viral episomes. Upon infection, LANA co-opts SOX18 to recruit the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex via its ATPase subunit BRG1, enhancing chromatin accessibility and enabling efficient viral genome persistence.

L.; Ovcharenko, I.", "abstract": "Abstract The strength of the repressive histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation modification signal varies drastically at individual silencers. Focusing on cases of an unusually strong repressive signal in regions that we refer to as super-silencers, we demonstrate that the regions that become B-cell super-silencers are originally associated with gene upregulation during development, and their target genes are highly expressed in stem cells, especially during early developmental stages. About 13% of B-cell super-silencers transmute to super-enhancers in B-cell lymphoma and 22% of these conversions recur across more than half of patients. Notably, genes associated with these conversions, like BCL6 and BACH2, are downregulated more swiftly than others when subjected to JQ1, a super-enhancer-disrupting bromodomain and extra-terminal domain inhibitor utilized in cancer chemotherapy. Furthermore, super-silencers are characterized by an over-representation of B-cell-cancer-associated mutations, both somatic and germline, and B-cell-cancer translocation breakpoints. This surpasses the prevalence found in other regulatory elements, such as CTCF binding sites, underlining the crucial role of super-silencers in forming and stabilizing regulatory topologies in standard B cells. For example, over 80% of cases involving the B-cell-lymphoma translocation t(3;14)(q27;q32) fuse super-silencers in the BCL6 locus with enhancer-rich domains. Finally, we demonstrate that the repressive mechanisms of super-silencers are partially governed by the CpG content in their sequences. While CpG-rich super-silencers often prevent promoters from interacting with enhancers, CpG-depleted super-silencers typically suppress the chromatin looping of nearby enhancers. In summary, our findings accentuate the critical role super-silencers play in the normal function of B-cells, suggesting that sequence mutations and activity modifications in these elements could be primary factors in B-cell carcinogenesis.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Historically, cold temperatures and shallow water tables in bogs have favored the growth of Sphagnum over vascular plants. Seasonally variable water tables in bogs constrain woody shrub and tree root production to shallow, oxic acrotelm peat horizons while herbs with aerenchymous root tissue can grow below the water table. Warming and elevated CO2 are altering ecosystem functioning in nutrient-limited, rain-fed (ombrotrophic) bogs, via direct impacts on physiology and indirectly via altering water table levels. The environmental changes are shifting interactions between vascular plant fine-roots and the surrounding peat horizons and increasingly favoring vascular plant growth relative to Sphagnum sp. Altered functioning of fine-roots may dramatically affect the role of plants in these ecosystems because of the importance of these organs for plant resource acquisition. We examined how fine-roots across vascular PFTs differentially respond to warming & elevated CO2 manipulations and the consequent water table depression in a forested, boreal bog. We used minirhizotrons (cameras inserted belowground) to measure fine-root production, depth distribution, and standing crop from 2015-2021 for each PFT. We found that daily rates of fine-root production accelerated more for shrubs than for trees or herbs. Shrubs and trees grew their roots more deeply with depressed water table levels and shrub fine-roots became narrower. On an annual basis, fine-root production increased with warming, though these rates varied among PFTs and exhibited interactions with elevated CO2. Standing crop of fine-roots increased with warming temperatures, most strongly for shrubs under elevated CO2, because of these productivity responses. From these results, we expect boreal bogs will become increasingly dominated by shrubs under future warmer temperatures, higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and lower water table levels.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

One such species of conservation concern, the eastern whip-poor-will (Antrostomus vociferus), requires diverse forest structural conditions to meet its breeding season habitat requirements. We used airborne LiDAR data and autonomous recording units (ARUs) to identify elements of forest structure that influence whip-poor-will breeding season abundance in Pennsylvania, USA. Specifically, we applied a machine-learning classifier for whip-poor-will song to audio recordings obtained from 851 ARUs that were deployed in forested landscapes and then created daily detection histories to estimate whip-poor-will relative abundance. Whip-poor-wills were detected at 334 survey locations (41%). Abundance exhibited positive linear relationships with percent forest cover and percent oak forest and a negative linear relationship with percent impervious cover. Whip-poor-will abundance was also influenced by forest structure, with abundance exhibiting a quadratic relationship with two LiDAR-derived covariates; canopy heterogeneity and height within 300 m. Using these results, we predicted whip-poor-will abundance and habitat management potential. Whip-poor-will conservation in our study region will depend on public and private land efforts that maintain heavily forested, oak dominated landscapes that are managed using practices that increase canopy height diversity among and within stands.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated natural variation in nutritional secretions in an invertebrate species, the honey bee (Apis mellifera L.). This is a unique bee wherein developing larvae subsist entirely on \"jellies\" (e.g., royal jelly) produced by glands in adult worker bees. We assess among nestmate and among-colony variation in the macronutrient content of the secretions fed to female worker larvae (\"worker jelly\"). Although female workers make up the largest demographic inside a honey bee colony, very few studies have investigated their larval diet; even fewer have included the scope of colonies needed to assess natural variation in this critical nutritional substance. In one of the largest such studies to date, we found significant variation both among nestmates and among colonies in total quantity and macronutrient content of worker jelly. This pattern was strongest, surprisingly, for proteins and lipids. Moreover, the macronutrient ratio in worker jelly differs substantially from source pollen, suggesting adult workers retain substantial consumed nutrients, especially lipids. We further assessed whether worker jelly composition was correlated with colony defensive aggression because of extensive links between aggression, foraging activity, and larval development outcomes; however, we observed no such relationship.

Diatoms and dinoflagellates are the two most common bloom-forming classes, with distinct ecologies and bloom dynamics. Using time series from a long-term phytoplankton monitoring survey (REPHY) of French coastal waters analysed with ecological association networks and diversity metrics, we investigated how blooms of diatoms and dinoflagellates affect diversity and community structure within phytoplankton communities. We highlight distinct responses: an increase in species richness during diatom blooms and a decrease during dinoflagellate blooms. However, both bloom types resulted in a decrease in alpha diversity indices. Temporal association networks modularity and association strength were also differently impacted between both bloom types. However, high-level association types and composition in association networks remain stable, suggesting an important role of their proportions in ecosystem functioning and resilience.

We analyzed a new large MA dataset in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that the currently standard \"single-reference\" genotyping approach can lead to errors in LOH-rate estimates and produce spurious homolog biases. To address this problem, we develop a novel genotyping approach that is symmetric with respect to both homologs, removes dubious heterozygous markers and corrects for undetected LOH events. We report revised estimates of LOH rates across 12 yeast hybrids, which differ by factors between 0.19 and 5.3 from previously published ones. Our revised estimates do not support the previously reported positive correlation between the rate of terminal LOH events and the hybrid heterozygosity. Finally, our analysis reveals that the 60-fold variation in the rates of interstitial LOH events across yeast hybrids is driven overwhelmingly by genome-wide (trans) genetic factors. In contrast, the 6-fold variation in terminal LOH events is driven by both trans and local (cis) factors.

In this study, we investigate CRs influence on accessible chromatin (AC) and its relationship with genetic differentiation. We used ATAC-seq to decipher ACs of testis in two hybrids of D. albomicans and D. nasuta, and genome-wide fixation index (FST) scans of D. albomicans and D. nasuta to identify regions of genetic differentiation. Our analyses revealed that chromosome 4 (Muller F) harbors the largest number of differentially accessible regions (~97 Kb), which coincide with peaks in FST. Moreover, changes in ACs were associated with differential transcription factor (TF) binding across the genome. These results suggest that CRs can drive epigenomic divergence in hybrids, particularly on Muller F, and chromatin-level changes may play a key role in reproductive isolation.

The impact of Zn shortage on the root apical meristem (RAM) in particular has not been systematically explored. Using an integrative approach combining cell biology, transcriptomics, and ionomics, we dissected how Zn deficiency alters root zonation and function. We showed that Zn deficiency triggers a striking reorganization of the root tip (RT): the RAM size is reduced, yet meristematic activity and local Zn levels are preserved. This is accompanied by promoted cell elongation and differentiation. Transcriptome profiling revealed a distinct Zn deficiency response in the RAM-enriched RT compared to mature root tissues, with ZIP12 emerging as the most strongly induced gene in the RT. Functional analysis of zip12 mutants uncovered major defects in root growth, RAM structure, expression of Zn-responsive genes, and metal partitioning. Our work unveiled a new layer of root developmental plasticity under Zn deficiency and identified ZIP12 as a central player in maintaining Zn homeostasis and root meristem function in Arabidopsis.

Nevertheless, selecting update rules so that they capture the combinatorial control of various targets remains challenging due to limited quantitative data. Threshold majority rules (TMRs), a subtype of threshold functions (ThFs), update a gene's state based on the signed sum of its regulators and its own activity, offering an elegant simplification. However, does the use of TMRs come at the cost of biological realism? Here, we rigorously evaluate the two standard TMR variants regarding their suitability in GRN modeling. We find that they provide limited canalyzation, exhibit discordant bias patterns, and often eliminate self-inhibitions. They are also underrepresented in empirical datasets, the opposite of what is expected for biologically relevant rules. Compared to nested canalyzing functions (NCFs), another class of ThFs but known to be preponderant in empirical datasets, TMRs exhibit heightened complexity and sensitivity to perturbations. At the network level, TMRs frequently fail to recover biological attractors and the associated basin size distributions. Using ensembles of random Boolean networks, we also show that one TMR type drives the network dynamics toward the chaotic regime. These findings invite a thoughtful reevaluation of TMRs as an appropriate logic for modeling GRNs despite their theoretical appeal.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

When exposed to transfused RBCs carrying foreign antigens, some patients generate IgG antibodies that target these antigens, creating potential barriers to future transfusions. Interestingly, other patients produce only IgM antibodies against the same non-ABO antigens, which generally have fewer clinical consequences. Despite the stark differences in their impact, the factors regulating IgM versus IgG production in response to transfused RBCs remain poorly understood. This study explores the balance between IgM and IgG production following transfusion, comparing it to the well-characterized antibody response induced by vaccination in mouse models. By directly assessing antibody levels following RBC transfusion versus Alum-adjuvanted vaccination, we demonstrate that transfusion of RBCs expressing a model antigen is a relatively weak inducer of IgG class switching. Additionally, loss-of-function experiments using CD40L blockade and CD4 depletion confirmed that T cell help is essential for class switching after transfusion but has no effect on IgM production. Most notably, providing supra-physiological levels of T cell help enhanced class switching in a dose-dependent manner after transfusion, whereas vaccination-induced class switching remained unaffected. These findings support a model in which the limited IgG class switching following transfusion stems from suboptimal T cell help compared to vaccination. Furthermore, they suggest that transfusion activates T cells through a non-canonical pathway, distinct from the mechanisms driving immune responses to standard Alum vaccination.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Upon boosting, murine memory B cells producing high affinity antibodies tend to develop into plasma cells but few if any re-enter GCs. However, mice live for only a few weeks in nature, and in keeping with the rather limited requirement for immune memory, this compartment comprises only 1-2% of all B cells. In contrast, memory accounts for nearly 50% of all B cells in primates. Here we examine memory and GC B cell responses in rhesus macaques immunized and boosted ipsilaterally or contralaterally with an mRNA vaccine encoding severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike protein. The neutralizing activity of antibodies cloned from the memory compartment, and the size of the compartment, was independent of the site of boosting. Moreover, in primates, memory B cells enter and undergo iterative expansion in newly developing GCs when boosting is at a site distal to the site of priming. Thus, in primates, high affinity memory B cells constitute a reservoir that actively participates in further development of immunity irrespective of the anatomical site of vaccine boosting.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

While much of our understanding of Pa biofilms comes from surface-attached models, recent studies have emphasized the clinical relevance of suspended bacterial aggregates - dense, three-dimensional clusters that form early during infection and exhibit key biofilm-like properties. However, the physical characteristics of these aggregates remain poorly defined. Here, we apply atomic force microscopy (AFM) to visualize and quantify the structural and mechanical properties of Pa aggregates formed in synthetic cystic fibrosis sputum medium (SCFM2). Compared to planktonic cultures grown without mucin, aggregates formed in SCFM2 exhibited complex architecture and increased resistance to deformation, as measured by force spectroscopy. These differences emerged despite the absence of mature extracellular matrix components, suggesting that environmental cues and spatial organization alone may be sufficient to enhance aggregate mechanical resilience. Our results demonstrate that AFM provides a powerful, high-resolution approach for studying early-stage bacterial aggregates under physiologically relevant conditions. By resolving structural features and quantifying localized mechanical strength, this method offers new insight into how aggregate architecture contributes to persistence during chronic infection.

Ampicillin caused a reproducible depletion of beneficial bacterial species belonging to the Muribaculaceae family, including Muribaculum intestinale and Duncaniella dubosii, and led to cohort-dependent enrichments of Enterococcus and Prevotella species. These microbial alterations were accompanied by substantial metabolic remodeling, characterized by elevated fecal acylcarnitines and dysregulation of the bile acids profile. Intriguingly, we identified two previously uncharacterized trihydroxylated bile acids conjugated to a hexose moiety, which appeared to be associated with antibiotic exposure across public metabolomics repositories.

B.; Hu, Z.; Ward, R. W.; Lavelle, E. C.; Jin, T.; Geoghegan, J. A.", "abstract": "The interface between pathogenic bacteria and the host plays a critical role during the progression of infection. Bacterial surface components, such as the Staphylococcus aureus cell wall-anchored protein clumping factor A (ClfA), interact with host factors to promote pathogenesis. ClfA promotes bacterial aggregation in plasma by binding to fibrinogen. Here, we show that the host serine endopeptidase plasmin cleaves ClfA, disrupting its interaction with fibrinogen and promoting bloodstream survival and virulence in S. aureus. We found that plasmin cleaves ClfA between residues Arg214 and Ala215. Cleavage occurs in human serum regardless of whether plasmin becomes activated by host tissue-plasminogen activator or by the activity of the S. aureus enzyme staphylokinase. Expressing a plasmin-resistant form of ClfA, and a truncated form that mimics the plasmin-cleaved product on the bacterial cell surface, revealed that following cleavage ClfA cannot mediate aggregation of S. aureus in fibrinogen. While truncated ClfA on the cell surface cannot bind to fibrinogen, it promotes higher survival of S. aureus in human blood compared to ClfA-null S. aureus and the establishment of renal abscesses in vivo. Collectively, our findings suggest that activation of plasmin during infection leads to site-specific processing of ClfA, and this not only abrogates fibrinogen binding but also facilitates an alternative virulence strategy that enhances S. aureus persistence in the host. Thus, we demonstrate that proteolytic processing by plasmin is a mechanism for modulating the host-pathogen interaction during infection.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

While this interference has been shown to inhibit phage replication - resulting in reduced frequency of infection and viral titer at the population level - and mutation or knockout of the ac gene renders the phage resistant to acriflavine, the role of the ac gene product, Ac, has not yet been elucidated. This study aims to further explore the role of the ac gene in phage infection by expressing it in Escherichia coli and evaluating its effects on the host under varying growth conditions and during phage infection, both in the presence and absence of acriflavine. E. coli induced to express the ac gene from phage T4 showed an increased susceptibility to acriflavine compared to the same strain not undergoing expression (non-induced) or not carrying the ac expression plasmid (empty). Moreover, in the presence of acriflavine, the parental phage T4 was not able to infect the host variants (induced, non-induced and empty), suggesting the Ac protein is involved in a potential membrane modification leading to acriflavine hindering infection. When the ac gene was deleted from the T4 phage (T4deltaac), the mutated phage was capable of infecting the three host variants (empty, non-induced and induced) in the presence of acriflavine, showing resistance to this acridine. Based on experimental results and protein structure prediction, we propose that the Ac protein integrates into the bacterial host cell membrane and interacts with the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump, either altering its conformation or blocking its function, thereby preventing the excretion of acriflavine which accumulates in the cell and impedes DNA replication", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

This interaction is well known in hymenopteran parasitoids, where unfertilized eggs typically develop as males via haplo-diploidy in the absence of parthenogenesis-inducing bacteria. We report on a case of thelytoky in Alloxysta brevis (Thomson) (Hymenoptera: Figitidae), a globally widespread aphid hyperparasitoid. A previous study had shown that sex ratios of this species collected in Minnesota (USA) were extremely female biased, and we found here that unmated females reared from field-collected hosts produced female offspring without exposure to males. This result demonstrated thelytoky, and we tested for the role of bacterial endosymbionts by comparing offspring production of unmated females fed the antibiotic rifampicin to offspring production of control females not fed antibiotics. Antibiotic-fed females produced almost exclusively male offspring, and control females produced mainly females. This result showed that antibiotic treatment facilitated male production by unmated Alloxysta brevis females, thus implicating bacterial symbiosis in the expression of thelytoky. We then used molecular analyses to determine the identity of the symbiont. These analyses identified a Wolbachia strain from supergroup B, and excluded other bacteria known to mediate parthenogenesis induction, such as Cardinium and Rickettsia.

While limited KS can regress with immune reconstitution, such as through antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people living with HIV, there are currently no curative treatments for advanced KS. Preventive or therapeutic vaccines targeting KSHV could have a significant clinical impact; however, the development and testing of such strategies have been limited by the lack of preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate KS, including the presence of infected spindle cells and a relevant immune microenvironment. HIV/AIDS is an important cofactor for KS, and globally, the majority of individuals with KS are HIV-infected. Current evidence indicates that HIV-1 may enable KS progression through immunosuppression and promote pathogenesis by inducing inflammatory cytokines and producing secreted regulatory proteins like Tat and Nef. The design and testing of new therapeutic approaches based on pathogenesis are hampered by the lack of models that replicate KSHV oncogenesis in the context of HIV/AIDS. In the present study, we demonstrate that KSHV-infected cells can form tumors in an immunocompetent mouse model, but only when these mice are pretreated with EcoHIV and morphine, both of which have immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory effects.

In this study, using a combination of chemical and microbial analyses, we assess the nitrogen dynamics in the water column of a eutrophic coastal system (Stockholm Archipelago) at three sites with contrasting redox conditions (oxic to long-term euxinic). At the oxic site, counter gradients of ammonium and oxygen in the water column, low nitrate {delta}15N values in bottom waters, and the 16S rRNA gene-based presence of nitrifiers indicate nitrification near the sediment-water interface. At the seasonally and long-term euxinic sites, nitrification, as inferred from the water column oxygen and nutrient profiles and the relative abundance of nitrifiers, primarily occurred near the oxycline. At these two sites, nitrate was removed below the oxycline through denitrification linked to sulfide oxidation by Sulfurimonas. Nitrous oxide emissions from surface waters in the archipelago reached up to 40 mol m-2 d-1 and were not directly related to water column redox conditions, indicating that multiple factors control coastal emissions of this greenhouse gas to the atmosphere. The relative abundance of 16S rRNA genes and of N-cycle genes in metagenomes was highest at the seasonally euxinic site. Importantly, nitrifiers were significantly less abundant at the long-term euxinic site. Our results highlight that prolonged euxinia promotes recycling of ammonium over its removal, likely due to sulfide inhibition of nitrification, which sustains eutrophication and deoxygenation of coastal systems.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

In anoxic sediments, its degradation generates chitooligosaccharides and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), which are fermented into smaller organic molecules and oxidized anaerobically using soluble electron acceptors or insoluble ones such as metal oxides. To date, many aspects of chitin degradation in deep-sea anoxic sediments have been overlooked, including the potential coupling of insoluble chitin degradation to metal oxide reduction, the involvement of extracellular electron transfer (EET), and the spatial organization of the microorganisms involved. Using anoxic deep-sea sediments recovered from a whale fall site, we developed an innovative workflow based on electrochemical reactors, to characterize chitin degradation in these environments. Sediment samples enriched on poorly crystalline iron oxides, and subsequently transferred into an electrochemical reactor poised at +0.22 V vs SHE, showed active anodic current production when supplied with chitin, which increased 2-fold when amended with GlcNAc. Chitin reactors were dominated by Vallitalea (Firmicutes), Spirochaetota, Gammaproteobacteria and Desulfobacterota. Exoenzyme activity assays, metabolite profiling, and continued anodic current production confirmed ongoing chitin degradation linked to EET. We observed metabolic associations between chitin degraders and secondary consumers using in situ imaging (16S rRNA gene FISH coupled with BONCAT and nanoSIMS). These microbial partners, within the electrode-attached community, required close proximity to the poised electrode ([&le;] 10 m) to remain metabolically active. Supporting these observations, cultured isolates of Vallitalea sp. and Trichloromonas sp. recovered from the whale fall site exhibited chitin degradation and electrochemical activity, respectively. When co-cultured in an bioelectrochemical reactor, the acetate produced by Vallitalea sp. during chitin degradation fueled Trichloromonas sp., which facilitated EET, hereby demonstrating that syntrophic interactions are used to couple anoxic chitin degradation to EET in deep-sea sediments.

Notably, ~6% of the nuclear proteome consisted of metabolic enzymes, a finding further supported by other public proteomics datasets and in vitro nuclear activity assays. These results suggest that metabolic enzymes and/or their metabolites may modulate nuclear processes in T. cruzi, potentially influencing the epigenome and gene expression regulation, as proposed in other eukaryotic models. Altogether, our findings reveal dynamic remodeling of the nuclear proteome during the T. cruzi cell cycle and point to a previously underappreciated role for metabolic enzymes likely regulating nuclear functions in a cell cycle-dependent manner.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

U.", "abstract": "Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk for several pregnancy-related disorders, particularly preeclampsia (PE). However, there are limited studies determining the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on placental physiology and function. Methods: Placental samples were acquired from two large prospective cohorts: STOP-COVID19 and REBRACO studies. Placental villous tissues (VTs) were collected from pregnant women who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 without PE during pregnancy. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence were used to assess pathological features known to be altered in PE, including 1) syncytial knot formation; 2) alterations in renin-angiotensin system components; 3) and endothelial integrity. Maternal serum was collected to examine AT1 autoantibodies levels using an immunoassay. Results: SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins spike, nucleocapsid, and ORF3a were observed in the syncytiotrophoblast layer and stroma of placental VT. SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited increased numbers of syncytial knots, which were positive for Flt-1 and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. In addition, the presence of placental infarctions and excessive fibrin deposits was also observed in infected placentas. Infection was associated with decreased placental expression of PlGF and an increase in the placental Flt-1/PlGF expression ratio, mostly driven by PlGF. No significant changes in maternal serum AT1AA levels were observed. Finally, SARS-CoV-2-infected placentas exhibited a significant decrease in vimentin expression. Discussion: SARS-CoV-2 infection negatively impacts placental integrity in the form of increased syncytial knots, dysregulated RAS components, and endothelial damage. Since all these features are similarly disrupted in PE, this could be a mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy increases the risk of a PE-like syndrome.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

P.; Satoskar, A.; Paris, Z.", "abstract": "The complex life cycle of the human parasite Leishmania mexicana requires rapid translational adaptation for survival in two distinct environments: the insect vector and the mammalian host. These medically important protists lack conventional transcriptional control due to their unusual genome organization. Consequently, tRNA modifications may provide an additional mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. One such modification is queuosine (Q), which is incorporated at anticodon wobble position 34 of specific tRNAs. Here, we demonstrate that Q-tRNA levels increase substantially during Leishmania differentiation from the insect stage to the mammalian-infective stage. Mutant cells lacking the enzyme responsible for Q incorporation, tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), exhibit substantial changes in the proteome during differentiation in vitro. Specifically, downregulated proteins were enriched in NAU codons, whereas upregulated proteins predominantly contained NAC codons. We further evaluated the effect of Q-tRNA depletion on macrophage infections and using mouse model. Although LmxTGT2 knockout parasites exhibited normal growth and differentiation in vitro, they demonstrated impaired survival within macrophages and reduced virulence in mice. Taken together, these results highlight the critical role of Q-tRNA modification in maintaining translational balance and reveal a novel level of gene expression regulation facilitating parasite adaptation to changing environments and contributing to Leishmania virulence.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

While some ART procedures, including in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, are known to alter the epigenetic landscape of early embryonic development, their impact on DNA sequence stability is unclear. Here, we leverage the strengths of the laboratory mouse model system to investigate whether a standard ART regimen (ovarian hyperstimulation, gamete isolation, IVF, embryo culture, and embryo transfer) affects genome stability. Age-matched cohorts of ART-derived and naturally conceived C57BL/6J inbred mice were reared in a controlled setting and whole genome sequenced to ~50x coverage. Using a rigorous pipeline for de novo single nucleotide variant (dnSNV) discovery, we observe a ~30% increase in the dnSNV rate in ART- compared to naturally-conceived mice. Analysis of the dnSNV mutation spectrum identified signature contributions related to germline DNA repair activity, affirming expectations and evidencing the quality of our dnSNV calls. We observed no enrichment of dnSNVs in specific genomic contexts, suggesting that the observed rate increase in ART-derived mice is a general genome-wide phenomenon. Similarly, we show that the developmental timing of dnSNVs is similar in ART- and natural-born cohorts. Together, our findings show that ART is moderately mutagenic in house mice and motivate future work to define the precise procedure(s) associated with this increased mutational vulnerability. While we caution that our findings cannot be immediately translated to humans, they nonetheless emphasize a pressing need for investigations on the potential mutagenicity of ART in our species.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Alginate hydrogels are widely used clinically due to their biocompatibility, high absorbency, and ability to maintain a moist wound environment during healing; however, alginate can also promote bacterial biofilm formation and prolong healing. Depleting pyruvate using the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) has been shown in both in vitro and in vivo studies to effectively disrupt biofilm structure. This study entraps PDH in alginate hydrogels to disperse/disassemble biofilms formed by a prevalent wound pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PDH depletes pyruvate and alters the biofilm metabolism, resulting in the prevention and dispersion of biofilms. Alginate hydrogels exhibited compressive moduli ranging from 15 to 80 kPa, with the water content of all swollen hydrogels exceeding 90%, and demonstrated structural stability in simulated wound exudate. PDH loading of 0.85 U in 65 ul of alginate achieved maximum observed enzymatic activity, 60% of which was retained after six days. Notably, PDH-loaded hydrogels significantly reduced biofilm biomass by 40.94% compared to media alone and by 80.05% compared to the Dimora commercial alginate dressing. Furthermore, PDH-entrapped alginate hydrogels significantly reduce biofilm biomass without affecting the viability of human dermal fibroblasts, highlighting the commercial potential of the material.

X.", "abstract": "Deep learning models are widely used to extract feature representations from microscopy images. While these models are used for single-cell analyses, such as studying single-cell heterogeneity, they typically operate on image crops centered on individual cells with background information present, such as other cells, and it remains unclear to what extent the conclusions of single-cell analyses may be altered by this. In this paper, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that directly tests the robustness of crop-based models to background information. We create synthetic single-cell crops where the center cell's localization is fixed and the background is swapped--e.g., with backgrounds from other protein localizations. We measure how different backgrounds affect localization classification performance using model-extracted features. Applying this framework to three leading models for single-cell microscopy for analyzing yeast protein localization, we find that all lack robustness to background cells. Localization classification accuracy drops by up to 15.8% when background cells differ in localization from the center cell compared to when the localization is the same. We further show that this lack of robustness can affect downstream biological analyses, such as the task of estimating proportions of cells for proteins with single-cell heterogeneity in localization. Ultimately, our framework provides a concrete way to evaluate single-cell model robustness to background information and highlights the importance of learning background-invariant features for reliable single-cell analysis.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

As a case example we use solanezumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets amyloid-beta (A {beta}), whose misfolding is the main factor responsible for Alzheimer's disease. For this antibody we predicted a single mutation, G95AHC, within the paratope of the heavy chain to disrupt antigen binding. This mutation, referred to as a \"dead mutant\", was experimentally validated using an immuno-infrared biosensor (iRS). Our results confirmed that the mutation abolished antigen binding without affecting the native structure of the antibody. The use of dead mutants enables precise differentiation between specific and nonspecific binding, which is particularly important in medical diagnostics. We applied this approach to analyze the binding of solanezumab to synthetically produced A {beta} ; variants and A {beta} ; catched by the iRS functionalized surface from cerebrospinal fluid, showcasing its utility in Alzheimer's disease diagnostics.

Our methodology leverages MOFA for dimensionality reduction to identify key latent factors driving heterogeneity, followed by LLM fine-tuning on these multi-omics signatures to enhance prediction accuracy. MOFA analysis identified five key latent factors capturing distinct biological processes: immune response, cell cycle regulation, metabolic reprogramming, tumor microenvironment interactions, and DNA repair mechanisms. We extracted the top features per omics layer for each factor and performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to characterize their biological significance. Our LLM, trained on curated multi-omics signatures and clinical metadata encoded as structured text prompts, significantly outperformed conventional statistical models in subtype classification, achieving AUC=0.93 and accuracy=0.89, compared to Random Forest (AUC=0.87, accuracy=0.82) and SVM (AUC=0.85, accuracy=0.80).

IT delivery of DT reduced Treg frequencies in the tumor, which promoted potent tumor control without autoimmunity. Interestingly, this control was principally mediated by CD4+ T cells, whereas CD8+ T cells only contributed when CD4+ T cells were absent. While conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were required to clear tumors, Batf3+ cDC1s were dispensable. Distant secondary tumors, mimicking metastases, were also controlled by IT Treg ablation. Mechanistically, IT Tregs suppressed antitumor T cell responses by blocking the acquisition of tumor antigen by cDC2s.

This study investigates structural analogues of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist KH-5, focusing on the impact of modifications to the nitrogen-containing heterocycle on receptor binding, affinity, and duration of functional antagonism. A series of 4-(hexyloxy)benzoate derivatives and their N-methylated quaternary ammonium salts were synthesised, characterised, and tested for binding affinity at all five muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1 - M5;). Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed that stable hydrogen bonding to N6.52 and salt bridge formation with D3.32 were critical for ligand-receptor interactions. Experimental data indicated that compounds containing an azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium group (e.g., 10a, 11a) exhibited the highest affinity and potency (up to 250-fold compared to lead compounds). However, these compounds had shorter functional antagonism half-lives compared to lead compounds, likely due to reduced molecular flexibility. Conversely, analogues retaining moderate flexibility (e.g., 7g) showed a balance between potency and sustained action. Structure-activity analysis demonstrated that charged nitrogen and the presence of a 4-hexyloxy substituent were critical for binding and prolonged activity. Shortening the alkoxy chain markedly decreased affinity and abolished long-term antagonism. Docking energies alone were insufficient to distinguish binders from non-binders; however, molecular dynamics-based metrics such as stable hydrogen bonding to N6.52 better predicted affinity. These findings emphasise the need for optimal spatial arrangement and charge distribution for high-affinity, long-residence muscarinic antagonists and provide a framework for future design of therapeutic agents targeting mAChRs.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Therefore, understanding the interactions and conformational dynamics that drive MBD2's high selectivity and strong binding affinity to methylated CpG is crucial to unraveling its regulatory mechanisms. In this study, through extensive classical MD simulations, we investigated the formation of the methylated CpG-MBD2 recognition complex. By positioning MBD2 one base pair downstream of its target mCpG site, we observed its transition to a stable complex at the target site within the microsecond timescale. Significantly, we observe that upon binding to methylated CpG, MBD2 forms two distinct stable complexes, with one state adopting a conformation that agrees well with the X-ray structure of the complex (primary state) and the other exhibiting a distinct binding conformation with lower affinity for methylated CpG (secondary state). Our data indicate that S189 serves as a key macro-switch, where loss of its interaction with the methylcytosine backbone shifts the complex toward the secondary state. This is supported by MD simulations of the S189A mutation, where we observe that the complex adopts a conformation closer to the secondary state. Ultimately, our NMR experiments confirm that the S189A mutation does not alter MBD2's selectivity for methylated CpG, while fluorescence polarization demonstrates a reduction in binding affinity, consistent with our MD simulations.

We estimate genome-wide genetic correlations between ER+ BC risk and three life-history traits (age at menarche, age at first birth, and the number of children born) for Lifelines biobank women using genomic restricted maximum likelihood analyses. We complement these by - for the first time - performing linkage disequilibrium score regression on European family-based genome-wide association study data. Regardless of the data or method used, genetic correlations were low and not statistically different from zero. Thus, we find no evidence for antagonistic pleiotropy between ER+ BC risk and life-history traits, suggesting that these germline mutations have instead accumulated due to weak selection at older ages. Our quantitative genetic analyses suggest that previous results showing antagonistic pleiotropy for individual genetic variants do not replicate when accounting for these traits' polygenic nature and that observed phenotypic trends do not have a genetic underpinning. While we find no evidence for life-history trade-offs shaping genetic risk for ER+ BC, our rigorous approach may provide a template for future studies to test the role of life-history trade-offs in shaping genetic risk for other diseases.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

P.; Morshed, M.; Wang, X.; Rong, L.; Wang, X.", "abstract": "Considering the serious global health burden posed by pathogenic viruses, the development of effective antiviral molecules and therapeutic strategies is critical for improving human health. Designing and synthesizing a versatile and biocompatible molecular platform offering neutralization of both coronaviruses and retroviruses, two virus families that are greatly problematic to the human population, remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a programmable and versatile platform built on a two-dimensional (2D) DNA origami that enables nanoscale spatial control of multivalent nanobody (Nb) patterns for a broad-spectrum antiviral application. By site-selectively conjugating a Nb to a DNA oligonucleotide and placing multiple of them to predefined sites on 2D DNA origami, we synthesized hybrid nano-architectures with tunable Nb patterns designed to approximately match the geometric presentation of viral surface proteins. We demonstrate that such specific Nb spatial configurations significantly enhance both viral binding affinity and neutralization potency. For SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus, a triangular Nb pattern with matched spacing with the spike proteins achieved an IC of 1.52 nM, representing a 171-fold improvement over monomeric Nbs. Extending this strategy to a retroviral virus, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) by utilizing a gp120 spike-binding Nb, we observed a 233-fold increase in neutralization efficiency using a patterned 2D Nb nano-architecture. These findings suggest a generalizable and versatile platform strategy for engineering potent antiviral agents through spatially optimized Nb presentation for a corresponding viral pathogen, offering a promising avenue for future antibody and Nb-based drug development.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

To advance efforts toward a reference human GI network, we developed the quantitative Genetic Interaction (qGI) score, a method for precise GI measurement from genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in isogenic human cell lines. We found surprising systematic variation unrelated to genetic interactions in CRISPR screen data, including both genomically linked effects and functionally coherent covariation. Leveraging ~40 control screens and half a billion differential fitness effect measurements, we developed a CRISPR screen data processing and normalization pipeline to correct these artifacts and measure accurate, quantitative GIs. Finally, we comprehensively characterized GI reproducibility by recording 4 - 5 biological replicates for ~125,000 unique gene pairs. The qGI framework enables systematic identification of human GIs and provides broadly applicable strategies for analyzing context-specific CRISPR screen data.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Epigenetic aging clocks showed high accuracy in age prediction, however, their biological interpretation is still a challenging task. Transcriptomics aging clocks provide better interpretability but worse age prediction accuracy. To exploit the benefits of both omics techniques, the main goal of this study was to develop the first multi-omics aging clocks based on combined epigenetics and transcriptomics features. For this purpose, we utilized a dataset where reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and RNA-seq measurements were measured at the same time for peripheral blood samples of 182 individuals. Then we trained machine learning models (ElasticNet) using the methylation and gene expression features at the same time. While the most accurate models tended to use exclusively methylation features, we were able to develop highly accurate multi-omics aging clocks too (called CpGenAge). Both the canonical and the non-canonical Nf-{kappa}B signaling pathways, with the genes EDA, EDA2R, EDARADD, and CD70, were overrepresented among the gene expression features of the multi-omics aging clocks. The EDARADD, which is a unique hallmark of aging, was represented among both the gene expression and methylation features. By developing single-omic clocks on the same multi-omics dataset, we found that epigenetic age acceleration and transcriptomics age acceleration do not correlate with each other, further supporting the benefits of our multi-omics approach. In summary, here, we demonstrate that multi-omics aging clocks are useful tools to investigate aging and biological age at the multi-omics level.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

Y.; Morina, I. Y.; Firsov, M. L.; Romanova, I. V.; Astakhova, L. A.", "abstract": "The vertebrate retina uses neurotransmitters to regulate its various functions and adjust vision according to the day/night cycle. Dopamine is probably one of the most important of these neurotransmitters. It is released by dopaminergic amacrine cells in the retina and exerts its regulatory effects, in part, through the cAMP pathway. It has been demonstrated that dopamine affects the phototransduction cascade in isolated amphibian rods. Furthermore, elevated intracellular levels of cAMP increase the light sensitivity of vertebrate rods and modulate the response of vertebrate cones. These effects can be triggered by dopamine receptors and adjust vision to daily light variations. Therefore, the evolution of dopamine loops in the retina is of interest, and the lamprey, being the most primitive vertebrate, could be valuable in this regard. In the present study, we examined whether the photoresponse properties of long (cone-like) and short (rod-like) photoreceptors in the river lamprey could be regulated by dopamine or cAMP level modulation. Using suction pipette recording, we demonstrated that dopamine slightly increased short photoreceptors sensitivity and it slowed the rising and falling phases of photoresponses in long photoreceptors and increased the integration time, with no effect on the sensitivity to brief flashes. The second part of our study - an immunohistochemical analysis of the lamprey retina - revealed that both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are expressed in both types of lamprey photoreceptors. Our results suggest that the regulation of photoreceptor functions by the neurotransmitter dopamine originated in the early stages of vertebrate evolution, specifically during the Cambrian period.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

H.; Keller, A.; Plesa, C.", "abstract": "Modern gene-synthesis platforms let us probe protein function and genome biology at unprecedented scale. Yet in large, diverse gene libraries the proportion of error-free constructs decreases with length due to the propagation of oligo synthesis errors. To rescue these rare, error-free molecules we developed BAR-CAT (Barcode-Assisted Retrieval CRISPR-Activated Targeting), an in-vitro enrichment method that couples unique PAM-adjacent 20-nt barcodes to each library member and uses multiplexed dCas9-sgRNA complexes to fish out the barcodes corresponding to perfect assemblies. After a single 15-min reaction and optimized wash regime (BAR-CAT v1.0), three low-abundance targets in a 300,000-member test library were enriched 600-fold, greatly reducing downstream requirements. When applied to 384x and 1,536x member DropSynth gene libraries, BAR-CAT retrieved up to 122-fold enrichment for 12 targets and revealed practical limits imposed by sgRNA competition and library complexity, which now guide ongoing protocol scaling. By eliminating laborious clone-by-clone validation and working directly on plasmid libraries, BAR-CAT provides a versatile platform for recovering perfect synthetic genes, subsetting large libraries, and ultimately lowering the cost of functional genomics at scale.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

T.; Brustle, A.; McColl, S. R.; Comerford, I.", "abstract": "Th17 cells are crucial mediators of protective immunity against extracellular pathogens but also promote inflammatory responses in pathological settings such as MS. Distinct transcriptional programs can generate Th17 populations termed pathogenic or non-pathogenic. Understanding the transcriptional regulation of these T cell states is emerging and presents opportunities to modulate pathogenic T cell responses. In this study, we demonstrate that pro-inflammatory Th17 cells in MS and EAE express high levels of the transcription factor RUNX2. T cell specific deletion of RUNX2 lowers the threshold for induction of CNS autoimmunity in mice by increasing generation of pathogenic GM-CSF-expressing Th17 cells. RUNX2-dependent inhibition of pathogenic Th17 priming relied on the extent of neutrophil-driven pathogenic Th17 priming in vivo. EAE-induced immature neutrophils elicit more pathogenic Th17 cells in the absence of RUNX2 in T cells, an effect reliant on neutrophil-derived extracellular traps. These data uncover a role for RUNX2 in suppressing NET-driven Th17 pathogenicity and suggest that increasing RUNX2 activity in T cells may be a strategy to constrain pathological inflammatory responses where Th17 cells and inflammatory neutrophils interplay.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}

D.; Perez-Cobas, A. E.; Andremont, A.; Martinez, J. L.; Baquero, F.; Lanza, V. F.; Coque, T. M.", "abstract": "Background. Metagenomics enables the detailed profiling of antimicrobial resistance genes; however, most studies focus solely on antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), employ low-sensitivity methods, and rarely investigate populations with minimal anthropogenic pollution. We analysed the faecal resistomes of 95 Wayampi individuals, an Indigenous community in remote French Guiana, using a targeted metagenomic capture platform that covers 8,667 resistance genes to antibiotics (ARGs), metals (MRGs), and biocides (BRGs) (PMID: 29335005). Resistome profiles were compared with Europeans to assess ecological and population-level differences. Results. ARG richness was similar between groups (259 in Wayampi vs. 264 in Europeans, 159 shared), but MRGs + BRGs (BAC) gene richness was significantly higher in Wayampi (3,670 vs. 2,039). Most genes appeared in a minority of individuals (mean 5% for ARGs, 2% for BAC), but several ARGs for tetracyclines [tet(32), tet(40), tet(O), tet(Q), tet(W), tet(X), tetAB(P)], aminoglycosides (ant6'-I, aph3-III), macrolides (ermB, ermF, mefA), and sulfonamides (sul2) were present in all individuals. Tetracycline resistance genes predominated overall, while beta-lactam resistance genes were more common in Wayampi, and genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides, amphenicols, and folate inhibitors were more frequent in Europeans. Among MRGs, copper and arsenic resistance genes prevailed, followed by those for zinc, iron, cobalt, and nickel. Up to 76% of Wayampiis carried acquired MRGs for copper (pcoABCDRS and tcrB), silver (silACFPRS), arsenic (ars), and mercury (mer) detoxification. Shannon diversity indices were similar for ARGs, MRGs, and BRGs, but composition and evenness differed significantly. UMAP and ADONIS analyses distinguished cohorts by ARG profiles (p < 0.001), but not MRGs or BRGs. Correlation analysis revealed conserved gene-sharing networks and introgression of acquired ARGs and MRGs in both gut microbiomes. Conclusions. The diverse and balanced Wayampi resistome reflects a less perturbed microbiome compared to industrialised populations, and a backbone of core and shell acquired ARGs and MRGs, consistent with the robust-yet-fragile architecture of scale-free networks. The patchy yet resilient distribution of resistance genes reflects varying levels of conserved gene sharing highways, probably developed and shaped by long-term microbial-human evolution. It supports a broader view of acquired antimicrobial resistance.", "date": "2025-06-30", "journal": ""}
