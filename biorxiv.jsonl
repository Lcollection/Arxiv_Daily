Such networks often display distinct architectural patterns--particularly nestedness and modularity--that influence system stability, diversity, and dynamics. Despite extensive research, accurately replicating these structures remains challenging, partly due to limitations in existing null models and synthetic network generation methods. Traditionally, nested and modular network ensembles are derived either from ad hoc constructions or large sets of random networks, with structural patterns evaluated a posteriori. In this article, we present a comprehensive framework that integrates advanced null models with a synthetic network generator to rigorously assess bipartite network architectures. We evaluate the statistical significance of nestedness, modularity, and in-block nestedness scores using five null models across approximately 25,000 synthetic bipartite networks. Our analysis identifies systematic biases in certain models and introduces a Corrected Probabilistic model to address these issues. By combining the analytical simplicity of our network generator with a robust null model, our framework enhances the analysis of bipartite networks, offering valuable tools for ecology and beyond.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Here we investigated how olfactory signals reach two subsets of appetite-linked neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus: AgRP (agouti-related peptide) neurons, which stimulate appetite, and POMC (pro-opiomelanocortin) neurons, which suppress it. Using polysynaptic viral tracing, we show that AgRP and POMC neurons receive indirect input from partially overlapping but distinct areas of the olfactory cortex, indicating that they process different sets of olfactory information. We also identify different complements of neurons directly upstream of AgRP and POMC neurons that can relay olfactory cortical signals to the appetite neurons. Single cell transcriptomics shows heterogeneous expression of neuromodulator receptors among AgRP neurons, suggesting variations in the signals they receive. Integrated viral tracing and RNA localization further reveals selected brain areas where upstream neurons express cognate receptor ligands. Together, these findings outline multiple pathways by which distinct olfactory and modulatory signals are differentially routed to neurons that promote versus inhibit appetite.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Despite this, we still know little about how dopamine levels are regulated in vivo. To identify regulators of dopamine, we utilized Drosophila melanogaster cuticle pigmentation as a readout, where dopamine is used as a precursor to melanin. We started by measuring dopamine from known pigmentation mutants (e.g. tan, ebony, black) and then performed an RNAi-based screen to identify new regulators. We found 153 hits, which were enriched for developmental signaling pathways and mitochondria-associated proteins. From 35 prioritized candidates, 11 had an effect on head dopamine levels. Effects on brain dopamine were mild even when the rate-limiting synthesis enzyme Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was knocked down, suggesting changes in dopamine levels are tightly regulated in the nervous system. We pursued two of our hits that reduced brain dopamine levels, clueless and mask. Further examination suggests that mask regulates transcription of TH and affects dopamine-dependent sleep patterns. In summary, by studying genes that affect cuticle pigmentation, we were able to identify genes that affect dopamine metabolism as well as a novel regulator of behavior.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Much work in ecology has developed methods to help predict how natural populations respond to disturbances, but analyses of pulse and press disturbances has been largely disconnected. We present a unified matrix framework that links presses and pulses within the same analytical approach, showing how transient nonlinearities and demography shape fitness. We find that transient responses to pulse disturbances accumulate to determine the long-term response to press disturbances. For structured-population models, this cumulative change is given by a new Transient Response Matrix (TRM). Strikingly, the TRM also yields the second derivatives of population growth rate with respect to matrix elements. Thus, there is an intimate but unexpected relationship between nonlinear selection pressures on demographic rates, and the transient dynamics of populations. This relationship yields a strong correlation between TRM and generation time across 439 unique plant and animal species (2690 population models). We also show that the TRM is directly related to Cohen's cumulative distance measure for populations converging to stability. Our framework provides ecologists with a general tool to predict population responses to diverse environmental changes.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Recent studies of hippocampal engram cells, or neurons identified by learning-induced immediate early gene (IEG) expression, propose that these populations form the cellular substrate for memory. Previous experimental work suggests that cells are recruited into engrams via elevated intrinsic excitability and that learning drives coactivity among these cells to support retrieval. Despite this, an understanding of how engram dynamics evolve across learning and recall remains incomplete. Here, we combined activity-dependent genetic tagging with longitudinal two-photon calcium imaging to track CA1 engram population dynamics before and after fear conditioning. Our results reveal that engram activity is modulated by intrinsic dynamics, behavioral state, and stimulus-cued reactivation. First, spontaneous activity during quiet rest, up to two days before Fos expression, predicted future engram membership, consistent with the idea that intrinsic dynamics bias engram allocation. In parallel, we found sequential activity during locomotion recruited both engram and non-engram cells, but that engram cells were less modulated by velocity after contextual fear conditioning. Surprisingly, after fear conditioning, we did not find changes in the average spontaneous activity rates or correlations of CA1 engram cells. However, within the engram population, we identified a subset of cells that increased their spontaneous correlations after fear learning, specifically during quiet rest. Furthermore, we used a trace fear conditioning paradigm to show that CS presentation drove elevated activity and increased correlations amongst engram cells, demonstrating learning-dependent reactivation. Finally, computational modeling of CA3-CA1 circuit dynamics demonstrated that a network with strong excitatory-inhibitory balance, capable of CA3-driven reactivation, is consistent with our experimental results. Together, these results show that memory formation reshapes engram population dynamics across spontaneous states, behavior, and recall.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

In addition, less effective strains could potentially evade sanctioning by entering the same nodule as an effective strain i.e., piggybacking. P. sativum was co-inoculated with pairwise combinations of three strains of rhizobia with different effectiveness, to test whether ineffective strains can evade sanctions in this way. We assessed the effect of sanctions on nodule populations of bacteria and bacteroids using flow cytometry and the effects on nodule internal structure using confocal microscopy. We show that sanctioning lowered bacteroid populations and caused a reduction in the size of bacteria. Sanctions also precipitated an early change in nodule cell morphology. In nodules containing two strains that differed in their nitrogen-fixation ability, both were sanctioned equally. Thus, peas sanction whole nodules based on their nitrogen output, but do not sanction at the cellular level.

To control for such confounds, we developed an open-source Python toolbox that generates Artificial Languages with Phonological and Acoustic Rhythmicity Controls (APLARC). First, we explain all functionalities of ALPARC through a step-by-step guide.

Here, we constructed a computational whole-cell astrocyte model to assess which channels were responsible for astrocyte depolarization. Our simulations show that, unlike depolarization by bath application of potassium, local depolarization by potassium uptake and glutamate transporters required very large spillover and high-frequency stimulation. On the contrary, the model reproduced experimentally observed depolarizations by activating N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) or {gamma}-aminobutyric acid A receptor (GABAAR), on the astrocyte. Our models suggest two mechanisms for astrocyte depolarization, either by neurotransmitters or by potassium and glutamate transporters, which substantially alters the spatio-temporal dynamics of the phenomenon.

Current analysis strategies typically follow the ortholog conjecture, which posits that the expression of orthologous genes is most similar between species. However, the extent to which this holds true at different evolutionary distances is unknown. Here, we systematically explore the ortholog conjecture in comparative scRNA-seq data. We devise a robust analytical framework, GeneSpectra, to classify genes by expression specificity and distribution across cell types. Our analysis reveals that genes expressed ubiquitously across nearly all cell types exhibit strong conservation of this pattern across species, as do genes with high expression specificity. In contrast, genes within intermediate specificity fluctuate between classes. As expected, ortholog expression becomes more divergent with increased species distance. We also find an overall correlation between similarity in expression profiles and sequence conservation. Finally, our results allow identifying gene classes with highest probability of expression pattern conservation that are most useful for cell type alignment between species.

In mammalian cells, how the clathrin coat deforms the membrane into a vesicle remains unclear and two main hypotheses have been debated. The ''constant area'' hypothesis assumes that clathrin molecules initially form a flat lattice on the membrane and deform the membrane by changing its intrinsic curvature while keeping the coating area constant. The alternative ''constant curvature'' hypothesis assumes that the intrinsic curvature of the clathrin lattice remains constant during the formation of a vesicle while the surface area it covers increases. Previous experimental studies were unable to unambiguously determine which hypothesis is correct. In this paper, we show that these two hypotheses are only two extreme cases of a continuum spectrum if we account for the free energies associated with clathrin assembly and curvature generation. By tracing the negative gradient of the free energy, we define vesiculation pathways in the phase space of the coating area and the intrinsic curvature of clathrin coat. Our results show that, overall, the differences in measurable membrane morphology between the different models are not as big as expected, and the main differences are most salient at the early stage of endocytosis. Furthermore, the best fitting pathway to experimental data is not compatible with the constant-curvature model and resembles a constant-area-like pathway where the coating area initially expands with minor changes in the intrinsic curvature, later followed by a dramatic increase in the intrinsic curvature and minor change in the coating area. Our results also suggest that experimental measurement of the tip radius and the projected area of the clathrin coat will be the key to distinguish between models.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

However, the roles of these factors in genital development have remained unexplored. Here, we investigated the expression and function of C15, Lim1, and Al in the development of male and female terminalia (genitalia and analia). We found that C15 plays distinct roles in males and females, repressing male clasper bristle formation while promoting bristle development in the female epiproct. Unlike in the antennal and leg discs, C15, Lim1, and Al are not all simultaneously co-expressed in any anal or genital structures in either sex, indicating that the interactions among these factors have diverged across these appendages. Nevertheless, we inferred regulatory interactions between C15 and other factors, reflecting similarities between leg and male clasper development. Finally, we identified a male-specific C15 enhancer that is active in male claspers but not in the female epiproct, legs or antennae.

To accelerate the arrival of a new era, this research implemented several cutting-edge algorithms currently introduced in causal deep learning to observational heart disease patient data to find key mechanisms that lead to cardiac deaths under a highly flexible framework. Extracting latent causal DAGs from observational data using Graph Auto Encoder, and finding specific causal relationships and interventional effects under Structured Neural Networks (StrNN), novel findings regarding key causes of deaths in heart failure patients were found in numerous aspects. Specifically, existence of intervals where average treatment effects due to causal interventions in platelets, ejection fraction, and serum creatinine levels dramatically decrease or increase was found among heart patients, which can lead to significant eliminations or additions of practical clinical treatments in terms of reducing cardiac death event probability after cardiac failure.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

However, protein modifications including deamidation of glutamine and asparagine, and conversion of glutamine or glutamic acid to pyroglutamic acid, can change the sequence of peptides, leading to spurious taxonomic detections and potentially inaccurate archaeological interpretations. While a handful of examples of this phenomenon have been reported in the literature, the issue is potentially much wider reaching than currently realised. In reality, any time a peptide containing a deamidated glutamine or asparagine residue, an unmodified glutamic acid or aspartic acid residue, or a pyroglutamic acid modification is detected by proteomic search software, the sequence, and therefore potentially its taxonomy, may be incorrect, which could potentially lead to unsound archaeological interpretations. The Demodifier is a fast, open source tool which solves this issue by screening for modification-induced alternate peptide taxonomy, enabling archaeologists to make informed interpretations of the taxonomies of peptides detected in ancient samples. To assess its utility, the Demodifier is tested against an archaeological dataset containing all unique peptides reported in palaeoproteomic studies of dental calculus and vessels. The results reveal that modification-induced alternate peptide taxonomies are severely under-reported, occurring 15% more frequently than previously understood. Modifications were found to produce three different types of inaccurate taxonomic matches: those which yielded completely different taxonomic lowest common ancestors to the input peptide, those which were more taxonomically specific than the input peptide, and those which were less taxonomically specific than the input peptide. The Demodifier therefore enables the rapid detection of potentially inaccurate peptide taxonomies, avoiding spurious archaeological interpretations in future studies.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

To study the impact of TP53 nonsense mutations in vivo, we generated mice harboring the Trp53 nonsense mutation R210X that corresponds to human TP53-R213X. Initially, Trp53R210X mice appear phenotypically normal, although the proportion of female Trp53R210X/R210X mice is dramatically reduced. Female homozygous mice are poor breeders and remain smaller and lighter than female heterozygous and wildtype littermates. Trp53R210X/R210X mice start to show tumors at 2.5 months of age, and their maximal lifespan is 8.5 months. Trp53R210X/+ mice present tumors from 9 months of age, and by 16.5 months of age 50% of all heterozygous mice have developed overt tumors. 71% of tumors from Trp53R210X/+ mice show loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Homozygous mice develop hematopoietic and mesenchymal tumors, most commonly T-cell lymphoma and leiomyosarcoma, and heterozygous mice develop hematopoietic, mesenchymal, epithelial and sex cord tumors, most commonly osteosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. The tumor phenotype is similar to that of Trp53-null and Trp53-missense knock-in mice, although the Trp53R210X/R210X mice have a high rate of multicentric or metastatic tumors, and Trp53R210X/+ mice have a longer overall survival than Trp53R172H/+ missense mutant knock-in mice.

This study investigates the impact of resistant subpopulations and compensatory mutations in WGS-based rifampicin resistance prediction. Methods: Based on a dataset of 35,538 clinical M. tuberculosis samples the sensitivity and specificity of resistance classification were evaluated with and without considering subpopulations and compensatory mutations. Results: By lowering the fraction of reads required to identify a resistance-associated variant in a sample from 0.90 to 0.05, the sensitivity increased significantly from 94.3% to 96.4% without a significant impact on specificity. Allowing compensatory mutations to predict resistance further lowered the false negative rate. Finally, we found that samples with resistant subpopulations were less likely to be compensated than homogeneous resistant samples . Further analysis of these samples revealed distinct clusters with differing amounts of within-sample diversity, pointing towards different mechanisms of resistance acquisition, such as within-host evolution and secondary infections. Conclusions: Our results indicate that a substantial fraction of false negative calls in WGS-based rifampicin resistance prediction can be explained by masked resistant subpopulations. The genetic diversity within the heterogenous samples is consistent with at least 28% of the rifampicin resistance arising from secondary infections.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

ASPEN uses a sensitive mapping pipeline and adaptive shrinkage to distinguish allelic imbalance and variance in single cells. Through extensive simulation based on sparse droplet-based single-cell data, ASPEN demonstrates improved sensitivity and control of false discoveries compared to existing approaches. Applied to mouse brain organoids and T cells, ASPEN identifies genes with incomplete X inactivation, stochastic monoallelic expression, and significant deviations in allelic variance. This reveals reduced variance in essential cellular pathways and increased variance in neurodevelopmental and immune-specific genes.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Environmental DNA (eDNA)-based metabarcoding offers a cost- and time-efficient alternative to conventional biodiversity surveys, enabling detection of rare, cryptic, and elusive species from environmental samples. However, limited access to genomic technologies restricts the application of eDNA metabarcoding in highly biodiverse remote regions and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Here, we directly compared the latest portable nanopore sequencing methods with established Illumina sequencing for vertebrate eDNA metabarcoding of Zambian water samples. Our results show that due to recent improvements in sequencing chemistry and optimized basecalling, nanopore sequencing data can recapitulate or even surpass established protocols, demonstrating the feasibility of in situ biodiversity assessments. eDNA and camera trap-based species detections had minimal overlap in species detections, suggesting a complementary rather than substituting application of these biodiversity monitoring technologies. We finally demonstrate that our entire eDNA workflow can be successfully implemented in a mobile laboratory under remote field conditions by completing all steps--from sample collection to data analysis--within the Luambe National Park in Zambia.

R.; Kanagy, N. L.; Gonzalez Bosc, L. V.; Naik, J.

Many of these membrane proteins are regulated by plasma membrane cholesterol content. The ATP-binding cassette family a1 (ABCA1) transporter is a regulator of membrane cholesterol content. We have shown increased ABCA1 mRNA expression and reduced EC membrane cholesterol in resistance mesenteric arteries compared to conduit arteries. Previous studies suggest shear stress (SS) can increase or decrease ABCA1 expression in a cell-type-dependent manner. Hypothesis: SS sustains lower EC membrane cholesterol concentration through ABCA1-mediated cholesterol transport, facilitating H2S-mediated vasodilation. Methods: The effect of SS on ABCA1 and membrane cholesterol content was assessed in pressurized mesenteric arteries from male Sprague-Dawley rats and cultured human aortic endothelial cells. Pressure myography was used to assess the effects of ABCA1 inhibition on H2S-mediated vasodilation. Filipin was used to assess EC membrane cholesterol content. Results: SS increased ABCA1 expression in the endothelium of mesenteric arteries and cultured human aortic endothelial cells and markedly reduced EC membrane cholesterol. Inhibition of ABCA1 increased EC membrane cholesterol content and abolished H2S-induced vasodilation. Conclusion: SS facilitation of EC-dependent vasodilation appears to be mediated by membrane cholesterol content.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not well understood. Here, we investigated the effects of the selective NOP receptor agonist SCH-221510 (SCH; 0.01-0.1 mg/kg, IM) on behavioral and neural responses to aversive stimuli in squirrel monkeys (n=3). Subjects underwent Pavlovian fear conditioning, wherein a visual conditioned stimulus (CS) was paired with the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Event-related fMRI was conducted in awake subjects to evaluate CS-evoked neural responses. Behavioral and neural responses to the CS were assessed across three experimental phases: pre-conditioning (Pre-C), post-conditioning (Post-C), and Post-C with SCH administration. In behavioral assessments, CS presentation during Post-C elicited a robust suppression of ongoing operant responding, which was absent during Pre-C and significantly attenuated by SCH treatment (0.1 mg/kg). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results revealed that, relative to Pre-C, CS presentation during Post-C was associated with increased BOLD activity in brain regions previously implicated in fear processing (e.g., amygdala), expression and regulation (e.g., prefrontal cortex; PFC), as well as sensory integration. Critically, SCH (0.1 mg/kg) administration significantly attenuated CS-induced neural activation in these regions. Furthermore, resting-state functional connectivity analysis revealed that SCH administration decreased connectivity between the PFC and the amygdala, while enhancing connectivity among subregions of the PFC. Collectively, these findings suggest that NOP receptor agonism may attenuate conditioned responses to aversive stimuli by modulating functional interactions within the PFC-amygdala circuit.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

To address this, we utilized a single-cell co-assay of RNA and chromatin accessibility (ATAC) sequencing to identify gene regulatory networks in EwS. By comprehensively characterizing regulatory elements across cell lines, we identified multiple unique modules of gene regulation. Differential usage and prevalence of these modules was evident across cell lines, associated with distinct epigenetic and transcriptomic signatures, and in specific cases, modifiable by exogenous TGF-B;. When we examined primary EwS patient tumors, we observed these same regulatory modules were variably enriched both across and within tumors, highlighting the existence of intratumoral heterogeneity in gene regulatory networks.

Identifying what conflicts are occurring is essential for informed decision-making. 2. A scoping review was conducted to identify conflicts associated with British mammals using Scopus, Web of Science and additional screening of citations from eligible articles and websites. Conflicts were classified as economic, health, environmental or social, divided into 32 subcategories and then ranked using a Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS). 3. The review utilised 289 articles to identify 200 conflicts involving 48 mammals. The highest ranked conflicts were all measurable on an economic scale (involving rabbit, badger, brown rat, grey squirrel). We estimated an annual economic cost exceeding {pound}0.5 billion, which could exceed {pound}1 billion if all conflicts could be monetarised. The most common conflicts were reservoirs of disease and zoonotic disease. There was no difference in impact score between native or non-native species except when considered by subcategory. Non-native species had a higher potential impact than native species but this effect was statistically similar when geographical distribution was considered. Our results highlighted the importance of ongoing monitoring for some species. 4. The review identified that although some mammals represent a cost to some, they provide a benefit to others and may require a holistic approach to management.

It results from intricate interactions between microbial communities, the plant host, and abiotic stressors. We investigated the effects of drought and esca disease on mature grapevine phytobiomes. Grapevines display no esca leaf symptoms during droughts, but the impacts of drought and esca expression on fungal communities and wood health in mature plants remain poorly understood. We studied 43 uprooted 30-year-old naturally infected vines in three experimental conditions: well-watered asymptomatic (Control) vines, vines with esca symptoms (Esca), and vines subjected to water deficit (WD) over two consecutive summers. We profiled trunk, cane, stem and petiole Ascomycota communities by DNA metabarcoding with primers specifically designed for grapevine trunk-associated Ascomycota, and quantified wood necrosis. The Ascomycota communities of trunks and younger organs clearly differed, and drought and esca had different impacts on the Ascomycota communities of perennial and young organs. In the trunk, drought significantly decreased fungal diversity in healthy wood and increased the abundance of wood pathogens (e.g. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Botryosphaeria dothidea). In young organs, esca expression decreased the species richness and diversity of the Ascomycota community to a greater extent than drought. We also found that the relative proportion of healthy wood was smaller in plants with esca symptoms than in control plants. Thus, drought increased Ascomycota pathogen abundance in the trunk but did not increase wood degradation and esca expression, highlighting the need to investigate the molecular basis of plant-microbiome interactions under multi-stress conditions.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

The loss of the Magel2 gene causes abnormalities in growth and fertility and increased adiposity with altered metabolism in adulthood, which aligns with some of the pathologies observed in PWS. Given that anxiety is a prominent phenotypic behavior in PWS, we investigate the role of the Magel2 gene, particularly in hypothalamic POMC neurons innervating the medial amygdala (MeA), in the behavioral phenotypes associated with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS). Both male and female mice lacking the Magel2 gene in MeA-innervating ARCPomc neurons display no alterations in anxiety-like behavior during the open field test, light/dark test, and elevated plus maze test in the absence of exposure to acute stress. However, male mice with a Magel2 gene deletion in these particular neurons exhibit increased stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and reduce motivation/spatial learning, while female mice do not show these behavioral changes.

Thirty-four participants viewed computer-generated faces with neutral, happy, angry, and surprised expressions in frontal view under monoscopic and stereoscopic viewing conditions. Using time-resolved multivariate decoding, we show that EEG signals in immersive VR conditions can reliably differentiate facial expressions. Stereoscopic depth cues elicited a distinct and decodable neural signature, confirming the sensitivity of our approach to depth-related processing. Yet, expression decoding remained robust across depth conditions, indicating that under controlled frontal viewing, the neural representation of behaviorally distinguishable facial expressions is invariant to binocular depth cues. Eye tracking showed that expression-related gaze patterns contained comparable information but did not account for neural representations, while depth information was absent in gaze patterns--consistent with dissociable representational processes.

Here, we identify a geraniol synthase (Cymbopogon flexuosus geraniol synthase; CfGES) that catalyzes the conversion of geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) (also known as geranly diphosphate) to geraniol, as well as a previously unreported geranyl pyrophosphatase (CfG(P)Pase) that acts on both GPP and geranyl monophosphate (GP), albeit with different efficiencies, to generate geraniol. Virus-induced gene silencing of CfGES or CfG(P)Pase resulted in a substantial reduction in geraniol and its immediate product citral in lemongrass leaves.

Subcellular localization studies revealed that while CfGES exhibited dual cytosolic/plastidial localization, CfG(P)Pase was localized to the cytosol.

Key virulence factors including polysaccharide capsule and melanin, facilitate immune evasion and tissue invasion in the host. Recently, Titan cell formation, has been defined as another important virulence factor of C. neoformans and plays a pivotal role in disease progression. Titan cells are defined as enlarged cells with a diameter of [&ge;]10 {micro}m and are highly polyploid with a significantly thicker capsule compared to the yeast morphotype. Despite the established role of Titan cells in C. neoformans pathogenesis, the mechanistic details governing their formation remain largely unresolved.

However, the upstream signals, critical for the activation of cAMP-PKA pathway in the context of Titan cell formation remain poorly understood. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate that the central carbon metabolic pathway, glycolysis, is critical for cAMP-dependent Titan cell formation in C. neoformans. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of glycolysis significantly attenuated Titan cell formation.

Peripheral localisation of RNA is an event common to most cells and especially relevant in neurons where transcripts are trafficked to subcellular compartments to promote growth and differentiation in axons, and synaptic functions in dendrites. Here we show that in developing sympathetic neurons, m6A modification regulates RNA transport and local translation in axons. Critically, Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), a neurotrophin essential for axon growth and neuronal survival, promotes the axonal localisation of methylated transcripts and inhibits protein synthesis of trafficking RNAs, preventing premature protein expression. Noticeably, translation of the bifunctional mRNA Trp53Inp2 depended on the methylation of the 3'UTR, further supporting the key role of m6A modification in determining mRNA fate. Mutation of Trp53Inp2 m6A elements resulted in ectopic translation, defects of axon extension and neuronal death. Together, these data show that m6A is critical for RNA peripheral localisation and spatial regulation of protein expression.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Vascular alterations represent a major pathological feature of AD, and beyond the well-established roles of small vessel disease and large artery atherosclerosis, our group has previously demonstrated that brain large artery dilatation is associated with elevated risk of dementia and Alzheimer pathology. The most severe manifestation of this non-atherosclerotic arterial phenotype is dolichoectasia, an enlargement of large blood vessels (Gutierrez et al., 2019; Melgarejo et al., 2024). Despite consistent epidemiological evidence across populations, the mechanistic link between arterial dilatation and AD remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we induced dolichoectasia in AppNL-G-F mice, a model of amyloid pathology, by injecting elastase into the cisterna magna. After three months, brains were examined using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods. Elastase-treated mice exhibited a significant increase in amyloid plaques in the hippocampus (p = 0.021) and cortex (p = 0.029) compared with vehicle-treated controls. Neuronal loss was evident in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (p = 0.036), with a trend towards neurodegeneration in CA3 (p = 0.055). We also observed elevated p62 in the hippocampus and cortex (p = 0.009 and p = 0.001, respectively), suggesting impaired protein or autophagic-lysosomal clearance. Although no overt increase in neuroinflammation or astrogliosis was detected at this time point, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels were trending towards elevated levels (p = 0.058). Combined, these findings indicate successful elastase-induced brain arterial dilatation accelerates AD-related pathology in AppNL-G-F mice, providing mechanistic evidence that large artery dilatation may contribute directly to Alzheimer's disease progression.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Although widely attributed to dynamic adjustments in cognitive control, the neural mechanisms and temporal dynamics underlying this effect remain poorly understood. Here, we combined a release-and-press flanker task with EEG decoding to examine how trial congruency and response type shape behavior and brain activity in healthy adults. Behaviorally, the CSE emerged only when responses repeated, highlighting the dominant role of stimulus-response binding over abstract control mechanisms. Neural decoding mirrored the CSE: current-trial congruency was more reliably decoded on repeated-response trials following congruent versus incongruent trials. This neural CSE was stimulus-locked, occurred between 450-550ms post stimulus onset, and was driven by theta-band activity. More broadly, congruency decoding was particularly robust over frontal channels while cross-temporal generalization indicated transient, sequential neural representations underlying control signals. Together, these findings demonstrate that both behavioral and neural signatures of the CSE are tightly constrained by response repetition and emerge within a narrow temporal window.

By visualizing endogenous Camk2a mRNAs at single molecule resolution using a newly developed mouse model, we identified a rapid activity-dependent localization of mRNAs to stimulated spines near the postsynaptic density (PSD) of hippocampal neurons. This spine localization was conferred by cis-acting regulatory elements termed cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPEs) in Camk2a mRNA. Spine-localized Camk2a underwent on-site translation, which persisted for extended periods.

EBF1 is a transcription factor best known for its importance in B cell lineage specification, during which it acts as both an activator and a repressor. Our results indicate that EBF1 prevents the Kollikers organ cells from being recruited to the prosensory domain by promoting expression of Prdm16 and repressing expression of Jag1 and Sox2.

W.; Strug, L.", "abstract": "Long-read sequencing (LRS) technologies have enhanced the ability to resolve complex genomic architecture and determine the 'phase' relationships of genetic variants over long distances. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify individual variants associated with complex traits, they do not typically account for whether multiple associated signals at a locus may act in cis or trans, or whether they reflect allelic heterogeneity. As a result, effects that arise specifically from phase relationships may remain hidden in analyses using short-read and microarray data. While the advent of LRS has enabled accurate measurement of phase in population cohorts, statistical methods that leverage phase in genetic association analysis remain underdeveloped. Here, we introduce the Regression on Phase (RoP) method, which directly models cis and trans phase effects between variants under a regression framework. In simulations, RoP outperforms genotype interaction tests that detect phase effects indirectly, and distinguishes in-cis from in-trans phase effects. We implemented RoP at two cystic fibrosis (CF) modifier loci discovered by GWAS. At the chromosome 7q35 trypsinogen locus, RoP confirmed that two variants contributed independently (allelic heterogeneity). At the SLC6A14 locus on chromosome X, phase analysis uncovered a coordinated regulatory mechanism in which a promoter variant modulates lung phenotypes in individuals with CF when acting in cis with a lung-specific enhancer (E2765449/enhD); this mechanism was confirmed in functional studies. These findings highlight the potential of leveraging phase information from LRS in genetic association studies. Analyzing phase effects with RoP can provide deeper insights into the complex genetic architectures underlying disease phenotypes, ultimately guiding more informed functional investigations and potentially revealing new therapeutic targets.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

To systematically test synonymous neutrality across the human genome we utilize recent advances in base editing to probe the fitness effects of 8,558 potential synonymous mutations in 128 highly essential genes. Combined with novel base editing controls and extensive individual sgRNA guide-level validation experiments that quantify false positive rates, we find that synonymous mutations rarely have fitness effects on growth, occurring 165-fold (95% CI, 35-2929 fold) less frequently than non-synonymous fitness-altering mutations.

The formation of myelin sheaths thus involves efficient trafficking and sorting of future myelin constituents via vesicles that fuse with prospective myelin membranes by exocytotic mechanisms. However, the functional relevance of other trafficking steps in oligodendocytes for myelin biogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we followed the hypothesis that developmental myelination involves endocytic mechanisms. In this model, Golgi-derived vesicles fuse with the oligodendroglial plasma membrane, from which myelin constituents are retrieved by endocytosis into endosomal/lysosomal organelles before their final integration into the growing sheath. Considering that adaptor protein complex-2 subunit- (AP2M) facilitates AP2-dependent endocytosis, we recombined the Ap2m-gene in myelin-forming oligodendrocytes, causing both hypomyelination and specific changes in the myelin proteome. Most strikingly, lysosomal membrane proteins accumulate in the abaxonal (outermost) myelin layer, identifying this membrane as an active site for retrieving constituents from myelin sheaths. These data demonstrate that the AP2 complex serves a critical function in developmental myelination in vivo. Unexpectedly, we also observed pathological myelin outfoldings indicative of focal hypermyelination. Consistent with the hypothesis that this phenotype reflects impaired maintenance rather than biogenesis of myelin sheaths, recombination of the Ap2m-gene in oligodendrocytes of adult mice caused late-onset progressive focal hypermyelination. These results indicate that, in addition to astrocytic and microglial phagocytosis, oligodendrocytes cell-autonomously contribute to maintaining the structure of healthy myelin sheaths via AP2-dependent mechanisms.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

We created two age groups based on evidence for episodic memory decline after 30 years: a youth group encompassing childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood (6-29 years) and an aging group (30-81 years). To test if the dLPFC-DMN FC was associated with changes in cognitive control, we used longitudinal change (up to 10 years) in a Stroop inhibition/switching task linked to the prefrontal cortex. Results showed (i) lower dLPFC and DMN connectivity with age in the youth group and higher connectivity in the aging group, and (ii) this FC was associated with an age-related increase in the inhibition task completion time, particularly in the aging group. However, dLPFC showed similar relationships with other networks, particularly salient attentional and control subnetworks, and despite decline in cognitive control associated with memory performance, memory-related FC between dLPFC and DMN did not.

PARP inhibitors are thought to cause toxicity by trapping PARP1 at single strand breaks, preventing single strand break repair, thus leading to accumulation of DNA damage and cancer cell death. Intriguingly though, different PARP inhibitors display similar cellular toxicities and catalytic inhibition despite having widely varying trapping potencies. To better understand this apparent contradiction and identify complementary mechanisms of action, we here visualize the effect of inhibitors on individual PARP1 and PARP2 molecules by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We find, surprisingly, that inhibitors cause significant PARP1 compaction and loss of molecular flexibility also in the absence of DNA. This compaction correlates with the trapping potency of the inhibitor; and could be functionally relevant by reducing the subsequent binding of pre-treated PARP1 to DNA. Such changes are less pronounced for PARP2, which shares a high sequence identity with the PARP1 catalytic domain but lacks the DNA binding domain present in PARP1. Our findings reveal an additional, DNA-independent mechanism of action for PARP inhibitors, where PARP inhibitors with strong trapping potencies target PARP1 in the absence of DNA, compact their conformation and thereby reduce its ability to bind to DNA.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived microglia-like cells to investigate stress responses to amyloid beta, a chronic Alzheimer's disease-related stressor, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a classical acute inflammatory stimulus. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we mapped the transcriptional programs activated by each condition and benchmarked these states against reference microglial datasets from mouse and human brains. In parallel, we performed a pooled CRISPR interference screen targeting Alzheimer's disease-associated microglial genes to identify genetic determinants of microglial survival. We found that amyloid beta and LPS elicit partially overlapping but distinct transcriptional responses. amyloid beta induced more focused and disease-associated gene expression changes, while LPS triggered broad inflammatory activation and stronger cell death signatures. A subset of genes activated by stress overlapped with Alzheimer's disease risk genes and with hits from the survival screen, suggesting that disease-associated microglial genes may contribute to stress adaptation and cellular fitness. These results demonstrate that iPSC-derived microglia-like cells can recapitulate in vivo-like stress-responsive states and offer a tractable platform to investigate genetic and environmental influences on microglial behavior.

Base resolution 6 base sequencing showed the expected loss of 5hmC and increased 5mC in Tfh cells purified from Tet2/3 DKO severe mice, and suggested that the observed bias in gene expression patterns could arise both from a direct increase in methylation of essential enhancers stemming from TET deficiency, or because methylation interfered with binding of methylation sensitive transcriptional regulators including CTCF.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Targeting this complex has emerged as a promising anticancer strategy. Here, we develop TEAi, a 64-amino acid peptide derived from Drosophila Nerfin-1, which directly binds the TEA DNA-binding domain of TEAD. TEAi potently suppressed TEAD-YAP-driven transcriptional activity, as evidenced by luciferase reporter and qPCR assays targeting canonical downstream genes CTGF and CYR61. Mechanistically, TEAi inhibited the DNA-binding capacity of TEAD2 without direct DNA interaction, thereby abolishing promoter recruitment of the TEAD-YAP complex. unexpectedly, TEAi induced nuclear export and cytoplasmic accumulation of TEAD2, suggesting a non-canonical mechanism distinct from native Nerfin-1 function. Functionally, TEAi significantly suppressed cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Unlike inhibitors targeting the YAP-binding interface, TEAi directly blocks the DNA-binding activity of TEAD, offering a potential advantage by comprehensively inhibiting all TEAD-dependent oncogenic transcription. Our findings establish TEAi as a promising prototype for therapeutics targeting TEAD, with implications for treating cancers driven by Hippo pathway dysregulation.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

While standard methods for pseudoknot prediction require O(N6) time complexity, we present a hierarchical approach that significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining prediction accuracy. Our method analyzes RNA structures by dividing them into contiguous regions of unpaired bases derived from known secondary structures (\"sections\"). We examine pseudoknot interactions between sections using a nearest-neighbor energy model and dynamic programming. The algorithm scales as O(n2{ell}4), offering substantial computational advantages over existing global prediction methods. Our analysis of 726 transfer messenger RNA and 455 Ribonuclease P RNA sequences reveals that biologically relevant pseudoknots are highly concentrated among section pairs with large minimum free energy gains. Over 90% of connected section pairs appear within just the top 3% of section pairs ranked by MFE gain. For 2-clusters, our method achieves high prediction accuracy with sensitivity exceeding 0.90 and positive predictive value above 0.80. For 3-clusters, we discovered asymmetric behavior where \"former\" section pairs (formed early in the sequence) predict accurately, while \"latter\" section pairs show different formation patterns. The hierarchical section-based approach demonstrates that local energy considerations can effectively predict pseudoknot formations between unpaired regions. Our work provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of local energy calculations in pseudoknot prediction and offers insights into the dynamic processes governing RNA structure formation.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

In this study, an analytic pipeline for detecting a key algal taxonomic barcode, rbcL, from WGS datasets. This approach allowed for near-perfect detection of rbcL sequences from eight major algal phyla, whereas in silico PCR utilizing popular phyla-specific rbcL primer sets for four algal phyla suggests that such approaches may miss much algal diversity. Further, a machine learning classification model was built and validated to allow for taxonomic classification of rbcL sequences of eight algal phyla to genus or species level with high accuracy and recall values (>90%). Benchmarking of this approach against microscopic algal identifications showed accurate identifications for algae with higher relative abundance values and may offer additional detections of algae not readily identified by microscopy. This pipeline was applied against over 4,000 freshwater WGS metagenomes to generate a global taxonomic occurrence and relative abundance database of freshwater algae composed of over 14,000 accessions.

Chlorpyrifos (CPF), is an endocrine disruptor pesticide that promotes a stemness phenotype and triggers molecular mechanisms involved in ET resistance. The goal of this study is to assess whether CPF induces tamoxifen (TAM) resistance by modulating estrogen receptor alpha (RE) expression through histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) regulation. We analyzed public databases of breast cancer patients and performed in vitro experiments using the MCF-7 cell line. We evaluated whether the co-pretreatment with CPF and TAM (CPF+TAM) modulates stemness and ET resistance markers. We found that CPF+TAM selects cells that exhibit increased clonogenicity, enhanced mammosphere-forming ability, and upregulates the stemness markers CD44, NANOG and POU5F1 while decreasing CD24. This selected cell subpopulation shows higher levels of mRNA and elevated protein expression of RE and HDAC1. Finally, we identified a resistance and stemness marker signature induced by CPF+TAM that closely resembles the profile observed in the dataset of patients who acquired tamoxifen resistance. Our findings show that CPF promotes an undifferentiated basal-like cell phenotype that contributes to TAM resistance, reinforcing the need for global restrictions to safeguard public health.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

M.; Dridi, D.; Lasram, K.; Ben Abdeljalil, N.; Omezzine, A.; Boughattas, N. A.", "abstract": "Purpose Ifosfamide (IFO), an alkylating anticancer drug, is clinically effective but limited by severe toxicities, notably encephalopathy and urotoxicity. Chronotherapy -optimizing drug delivery according to circadian timing- may improve its therapeutic index and reduce toxicity. This study investigated circadian variation in IFO-induced toxicities in mice. Methods A total of 160 male Swiss albino mice were synchronized to a 12:12 h light-dark cycle. In an earlier study, IFO chronotolerance assessed at LD50 (a lethal dose to 50 % of mice) showed circadian survival rhythms but high lethality, limiting organ-specific analyses. In this study, we used a sublethal dose LD30 of IFO (the dose lethal to 30% of mice) to allow detailed evaluation of tissue chronotoxicity while reducing lethality. 140 mice were treated at four circadian times (1, 7, 13, and 19 Hours After Light Onset, HALO), while twenty controls received distilled water. Endpoints included hematology, hepatic enzymes, histopathology (brain, liver, kidney, bladder) and neurobehavioral performance (wire-hanging test). Results Significant circadian variation was observed across multiple endpoints. Survival (Fig.1) and organ injury (Fig.3) strongly dependent on dosing time. Administration at 7 HALO led to the worst outcomes, with ~47% survival and severe multi-organ injury, whereas 13 HALO preserved survival (~82%) and minimized organ injury. This six-hour shift represented a critical therapeutic window. Importantly, in mice (nocturnal species), 13 HALO corresponds to one hour after the onset of darkness (active phase), whereas in humans (diurnal species), the comparable stage corresponds to one hour after light onset (active phase), thus optimal treatment-timing is inverted between mice and humans. Assuming that for human the light onset occurs around 5a.m., 13 HALO in mice corresponds physiologically to 1 HALO, therefore, the optimal IFO administration time would be around 6 a.m.Toxicity is expected to increase from 1 HALO until 13 HALO. In rodent, hematological toxicity exhibited strong rhythmicity (Leukopenia: WBC: F(3,45)=52.4, p<0.001 and lymphopenia: lymphocytes: F(3,45)=61.8, p<0.001), with maximal suppression at 7 and 19 HALO and relative preservation at 13 HALO. Hepatic toxicity was time-dependent AST (F(3,45)=33.7, p<0.001); ALT (F(3,45)=28.5, p<0.001). Histopathological lesions varied by organ (bladder: Chi-square (3)=14.8, p=0.002; liver: Chi-square (3)=18.2, p<0.001; brain: Chi-square (3)=9.7, p=0.045; kidney: Chi-square (3)=11.6, p=0.021). Neurobehavior impairment was also modulated by circadian-.timing. Conclusion IFO-induced encephalopathy and multi-organ toxicities follow robust circadian rhythms in mice. Administration at 13 HALO (beginning of the active phase) minimized organ injury and improved survival. These findings support circadian-based chronotherapy as a promising strategy to improve IFO safety and therapeutic index for further clinical investigation.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

In contrast, kinetic models based on ordinary differential equations allow assessment of regulatory properties and dynamics. Building kinetic models, however, is still hampered by the lack of knowledge about kinetic parameters and is typically focused on individual pathways. Here, we present an approach to derive kinetic models of metabolism augmented by coarse-grained overall reactions that represent the remaining cellular metabolism and biosynthetic processes. Using algorithmic network reduction, we derive coarse-grained reactions that preserve the correct stoichiometry of precursors, energy, and redox equivalents required for cellular growth. Analysis of the GEM-embedded kinetic model uses Monte Carlo sampling to address parameter uncertainty. We exemplify our approach by constructing a kinetic model of cancer metabolism that includes an explicit description of cellular growth. We show that the GEM-embedded kinetic model differs in its control properties from the corresponding model without growth, with implications for understanding regulatory hotspots and drug target identification.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

In postmitotic neurons, these identities are established and maintained by another class of TFs known as terminal selectors (tsTFs). However, it remains largely unclear how the tsTF combinations are specified in newborn neurons, and how they then coordinate the type-specific differentiation programs of each neuron. To investigate these regulatory mechanisms, we performed simultaneous single-cell RNA and ATAC sequencing experiments on the Drosophila optic lobes and identified over 250 distinct cell types at four stages of their development. We characterized the common cis-regulatory features of neuronal enhancers and performed comprehensive inference of gene regulatory networks across cell types and stages. Our results reveal cooperative actions of pan-neuronal and tsTFs on cell type-specific enhancers, and that same effector genes are often regulated by different TF combinations in different cell types. During neurogenesis, patterning TFs are associated with different accessible enhancers before and after cell cycle exit, allowing them to be re-utilized as tsTFs independently from their earlier roles in progenitors. We show that expression of tsTFs Vsx1/2 in a variety of optic lobe neurons is mediated by lineage-specific enhancers, each patterned by different upstream mechanisms. Therefore, neuronal identity specification is a multi-step regulatory program wherein the same TFs can enact distinct regulatory codes at different steps and across cell types.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Yet the molecular and cellular diversity of remodeling across neuron types remains incompletely understood. Here, we uncover a distinct remodeling mode in a subtype of Drosophila dopamine neurons (DANs) critical for learning, memory, sleep, and locomotion. Unlike the stereotypical pruning-then-regrowth paradigm, these DANs undergo a transient axon overgrowth followed by selective pruning during metamorphosis. Remarkably, DAN axon pruning proceeds independently of canonical ecdysone signaling and instead involves neuron-intrinsic AKT-GSK3{beta} signaling and extrinsic glial activity. Disruption of AKT-GSK3{beta} signaling alters microtubule stability and impairs glial recruitment and clearance of axonal debris. Notably, the role of AKT-GSK3{beta} is cell-type specific, underscoring mechanistic diversity in remodeling programs.

Our ability to develop disease-modifying treatments that slow down the loss of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopaminergic (DA) neurons is hindered by a dearth of knowledge on roles for non-neuronal elements such as astrocytes during PD pathogenesis. More specifically, the extent to which mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage in SNc astrocytes contributes to SNc DA neuron loss during PD remains unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we utilized an adeno-associated virus (AAV) called Mito-PstI that expresses the restriction enzyme PstI as an approach to damage mtDNA in SNc astrocytes and assess the effect of astrocytic mtDNA damage on SNc DA neuron function and viability in mice. Mito-PstI-induced mtDNA damage in SNc astrocytes disrupted mitochondrial morphology, caused increased wrapping of SNc astrocytic processes around SNc DA neurons, and abnormally increased dopamine release by SNc DA neuron axonal terminals within the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). In addition, mice injected with Mito-PstI in the SNc showed increased spontaneous and apomorphine-induced rotations contralateral to the side with SNc Mito-PstI injections. In further experiments, we used a parkinsonian mouse model with low dose 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) injection into the DLS to show that Mito-PstI expression in SNc astrocytes caused a worsening of 6-OHDA-induced spontaneous contralateral rotational behavior, and exacerbated SNc DA neuron loss.

We found that a commercially available anti-Iba1 antibody, made in goat, produces irregular staining patterns in specific regions of the mouse brain, prompting a further investigation into the phenomenon. This Iba1-goat antibody displayed increased numbers of labeled cells when compared to expression of a CX3CR1-GFP reporter and IHC detection of P2RY12, two common microglial markers. Furthermore, immunodetection by other common anti-Iba1 antibodies made in rabbit and chicken did not display the excessive cell labeling when compared to the CX3CR1-GFP reporter.

L.", "abstract": "People living with HIV suffer multiple comorbid conditions related to chronic inflammation at increased rates compared to the general population, even when on effective antiretroviral therapy. In particular, current data indicate that the increased incidence and severity of neurocognitive impairment (NCI) are associated with unresolved neuroinflammation. Attempts to treat NCI in people living with HIV by reducing inflammation have thus far been unsuccessful, suggesting that a more mechanistic understanding of inflammatory processes in the CNS during HIV is necessary. Here, we use iPSC-derived microglia (iMg) and astrocytes (iAst) to model HIV infection in the CNS. We show that our iMg robustly express markers associated with microglial identity and are susceptible to HIV infection, but exhibit lower HIV replication rates and weaker immune response to HIV challenge compared to monocyte-derived macrophages. Coculture of iAst with iMg leads to a much stronger pro- inflammatory immune response, and, surprisingly, a robust increase in rates of HIV replication. Increased replication in iMg/iAst cocultures is associated with higher levels of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFa, which is produced by iAst upon exposure to HIV-infected iMg. Addition of exogenous TNFa to iMg during HIV infection is also sufficient to increase rates of replication, and neutralization of TNFa via adalimumab/Humira treatment in iMg/iAst cocultures reduces replication. Blocking NF-kB signaling with iKK inhibitor Bay-11-7082(Bay-11) demonstrates that increased HIV replication in iMg/iAst cocultures is due to increased NF-kB activity. Finally, we show that in HIV-infected iMg there is movement of lysosomes to the periphery of the cell membrane and release of lysosomal content into the extracellular space, suggesting that this dysregulated lysosomal flux could further contribute to the pro-inflammatory microenvironment. We propose that this altered lysosomal trafficking and increased cytokine production drives a pro-inflammatory phenotype in glia and represents a potential source of unresolved neuroinflammation in people living with HIV.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

N.; Mydugolam, H.; Manjarres, Z.; Ramos Freitas, L. E.; Brandow, A. M.; Burton, M. D.; Sadler, K. E.", "abstract": "Chronic sickle cell disease (SCD) pain mechanisms remain critically understudied, even though more than 50% of patients develop this symptom as their disease progresses. Despite high face validity, there are critical gaps in transgenic SCD mouse model characterization and implementation that must be addressed in order to increase the translational relevance of these animals. First, it is unclear when the chronic pain phenotype first develops in these mice. Second, there are no studies that have measured chronic pain in animals following standard-of-care drug regimens. Herein, we address both of these gaps by performing reflexive pain behavior tests in hydroxyurea-treated Townes HbSS and HbAA mice from postnatal day 10 to 6 months of age. Hydroxyurea (HU), a compound that increases circulating levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), is a life-long therapy prescribed to individuals with SCD beginning as early as age 9 months. Here, we demonstrate that chronic mechanical hypersensitivity develops in Townes HbSS mice between P21-P28, a time frame that follows the HbF-to-HbS switch. When initiated at birth, HU treatment limits the extent of chronic mechanical pain development in HbSS mice. HU analgesic effects can be attributed to decreased innate immune tone in the periphery; life-long HU treatment decreases circulating monocyte counts in HbSS mice and reverses sensitization of TRPA1, a lipopolysaccharide receptor, in HbSS nociceptors. In conclusion, these studies provide additional support for early implementation of HU in SCD disease management, and furthermore, identify the LPS-TRPA1 signaling axis as a novel analgesic target for chronic SCD pain.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

To address this, we introduce an ECM-guided patient stratification pipeline through integration of multi-omic data in lung cancer patients. We obtained four patient groups, representing ECM-grades that showed distinct clinical features, mutation profiles, and cellular heterogeneity. Investigation of patient-specific ECM-induced intracellular signaling via network modeling revealed strong enrichment of pathways and transcriptional regulators related to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness in higher ECM-grades. Drug proximity analysis on ECM-grade specific networks predicted olaparib as an ECM-grade dependent therapeutic while erlotinib to be ECM-insensitive which were validated experimentally on lung tumor cells with distinct mutational profiles in response to differing ECM microenvironments. Overall, our ECM-mediated stratification approach is a robust system for capturing ECM heterogeneity and identifying patient groups that can be selectively targeted by distinct therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

More than 97% of ALS cases exhibit pathological TDP-43 inclusions, yet therapeutic strategies that can selectively eliminate these aggregates remain yet to be developed. Here, we employed the AUTOTAC (Autophagy-Targeting Chimera) to degrade TDP-43 aggregates via macroautophagy mediated by the N-recognin p62/SQSTM1 of the N-degron pathway. The AUTOTAC degraders ATC141 and ATC142 were designed to bind and link the oligomeric species of misfolded TDP-43 to p62, which induces the targeting of TDP-43 cargoes to phagophores for lysosomal co-degradation, while sparing monomeric TDP-43. ATC142 induced the degradation of pathological TDP-43 A315T species and its cleaved variant, TDP-25, with DC50 values of 1.25-9.6 nM. In ALS model mice expressing TDP-43 A315T in the spinal cord, oral administration of 10 mg/kg ATC141 with 24 doses reduced TDP-43 aggregates as well as GFAP+ astrocytes and Iba1+ microglia. ATC141 also exerted disease-modifying efficacy to reverse the disease progression in neuromuscular coordination and cognitive function. This oral drug is under Phase 1 clinical trials in South Korea with 76 healthy volunteers aiming to treat ALS, Alzheimer's diseases (AD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).

The Dnmt2 family enzyme Pmt1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is annotated as a tRNA C38 methyltransferase, but whether it methylates DNA in vivo has remained unresolved. Using orthogonal chemistry (HPLC/LC-MS and 1H-NMR) with external standards (limit of detection for 5mdC = 0.0125 mM), we detect authentic 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5mdC) in enzymatically digested genomic DNA from S. pombe. Quantification across isogenic strains shows that 5mdC is undetectable in vegetative wild type but rises to 0.518% (plus or minus 0.025) of cytosines two hours after G0 exit. Loss of the cytosine/5-mC deaminase Fcy1 causes marked accumulation: 1.445% (plus or minus 0.361) in vegetative cells and 5.943% (plus or minus 1.364) at 2 hours, approximately 11.5-fold over wild type. By contrast, pmt1{Delta} and fcy1{Delta} pmt1{Delta} remain below detection in all conditions, establishing Pmt1 as the DNA-directed methyltransferase in vivo. Nascent-strand fractionation and lambda exonuclease enrichment place this transient 5mdC pulse on Okazaki-enriched DNA, consistent with co-replicative installation. Functionally, the first S phase after quiescence shows increased Rad22-YFP foci in fcy1{Delta}, which are dampened by queuine ; in a sensitized background (ung1{Delta} thp1{Delta}), deleting fcy1 reduces C->T transitions by about 30 percent.

In this study, we aimed to leverage publicly available datasets to identify EBV-host gene interactions and re-map their expression at single-cell resolution. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of transcriptomic datasets to identify differentially expressed genes in NPC, mapped these genes to EBV-host interaction data, and constructed a network. Network clustering and pathway enrichment were performed, and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets were used to map these genes at cellular resolution. We analysed differences in cell cycle, immune signaling, cell-cell interactions, and assessed prognostic associations of a 12-gene UPS signature using the GEPIA2 platform. Results: We identified 85 EBV-interacting DEGs, most regulated by lytic-phase proteins. MCODE clustering highlighted genes related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Single-cell analyses confirmed elevated UPS-related gene expression in NPC compared to EBV-negative oropharyngeal cancer. UPS-High cells exhibited lower proliferative activity, enriched stemness signaling, and reduced antigen presentation and immune activation, whereas UPS-Low cells showed marked upregulation of growth-promoting pathways. Survival analysis revealed that high UPS expression was associated with poorer outcomes in both pan-cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma datasets. The proportion of UPS-High cells varied widely across patients. Conclusion: UPS activity, influenced by EBV lytic proteins, is linked to immune evasion, stemness, proliferation, and adverse prognosis. These findings support UPS as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in EBV-associated NPC, warranting NPC-specific validation and functional studies.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify platelet factor 4 (PF4) as a key mediator of vascular antimicrobial defense. In vitro, PF4 enhanced endothelial cell internalization of Escherichia coli via interactions with the PF4 receptor CXCR3 and the endothelial glycocalyx, directing bacteria to clathrin-mediated endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. In vivo, PF4 administration improved survival and reduced sepsis severity, bacterial burden, inflammation, and thrombosis in wild-type (WT) and PF4 knockout (PF4-/-) mice challenged with systemic polymicrobial infection. Using intravital microscopy, we observed that infused bacteria were rapidly sequestered in the pulmonary microvasculature. However, PF4-/- mice exhibited impaired bacterial clearance and increased microvascular platelet adhesion and aggregation. In the liver, following Kupffer cell depletion, PF4-/- mice had increased sinusoidal platelet accumulation, larger bacterial aggregates, and elevated hepatic bacterial burden compared to WT controls. Collectively, these findings reveal that PF4 promotes bacterial clearance and restrains immunothrombosis during sepsis in part via endothelial cell uptake and destruction of microbes. By enhancing endothelial antimicrobial function, PF4 represents a significant yet previously underrecognized host defense mechanism that limits bacterial spread and alleviates vascular injury during infection.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

While general ER chaperones are known to be essential for {beta} cell homeostasis, the specific mechanisms by which individual chaperones facilitate proinsulin folding and influence cell fate remain unclear. This study identifies FK506-binding protein 2 (FKBP2), an ER-localized cis-trans prolyl isomerase, as a critical regulator of human {beta} cell differentiation and proinsulin processing. Using loss- and gain-of-function FKBP2 models in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), we demonstrate that its deficiency impairs insulin processing, leading to abnormal insulin granule morphology and reduced insulin secretion. Unexpectedly, our findings reveal a crucial and unreported role for FKBP2 in cell fate determination. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals that FKBP2 loss disrupts the proper endocrine lineage allocation, causing a shift towards the  cell formation at the expense of {beta} cells. In KO endocrine cells, we observed sustained ER stress and elevated intracellular calcium levels, along with activation of the NFAT2-HDAC9 axis.

J.; Witteveen, I. F.; Winckler, B.", "abstract": "Vesicular transport along dendrites is well documented. Yet, the need for and regulation of directional dendritic transport is less well understood. One known example of directional dendritic transport are late endosomes moving retrogradely in dendrites towards the soma for the purpose of fusing with lysosomes for degradation. RAB7A and dynein have been shown to be required for late endosome motility and degradation, but the RAB7 effector responsible for late endosome motility in dendrites is not known. RILP is an established dynein-interacting RAB7A effector. In addition to dynein, RILP also binds the fusion complex HOPS. In this work, we use a separation-of-function mutant of RAB7A (RAB7A-L8A) which is not capable of binding to RILP but retains other effector interactions. Our data implicate endogenous RILP as a functional RAB7A-dependent late endosome adaptor for dynein motility in dendrites. It also promotes carrier formation. Since RILP also binds in a complex with RAB7A and HOPS, we expected to see fusion defects with lysosomes and impaired degradation. Surprisingly, lysosomal fusion and somatic degradation do not require RAB7A-RILP interactions. Despite the near normal degradation in RAB7A-L8A expressing neurons, dendrite arborization is impaired. RILP-RAB7A thus promotes dendrite arborization via promoting retrograde late endosome carrier formation and transport.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Overexpression of the mRNA binding protein Ssd1 extends the yeast replicative lifespan. Using microfluidics to trap and image single cells throughout their lifespans, we find that lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression is accompanied by formation of cytoplasmic Ssd1 foci. The age-dependent Ssd1 foci are condensates that appear dynamically in a cell cycle-dependent manner and their failure to resolve during mitosis coincided with the end of lifespan. Ssd1 overexpression was epistatic with calorie restriction (CR) for lifespan extension and yeast overexpressing Ssd1 or undergoing CR were resistant to iron supplementation-induced lifespan shortening while their lifespans were reduced by iron chelation. The nuclear translocation of the Aft1 transcriptional regulator of the iron regulon occurred during aging in a manner that predicted remaining lifespan, but was prevented by CR. Accordingly, age-dependent induction of the Fit2 and Arn1 high-affinity iron transporters within the iron regulon was reduced by CR and Ssd1 overexpression. Consistent with age-dependent activation of the iron regulon, intracellular iron accumulated during aging but was prevented by CR and Ssd1 overexpression. Moreover, lifespan extension by Ssd1 overexpression or CR was epistatic to inactivation of the iron regulon. These studies reveal that CR and Ssd1 overexpression extend the yeast replicative lifespan by blocking deleterious age-dependent iron uptake, identifying novel therapeutic targets for lifespan extension.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Mitochondrial quality control (MQC) mechanisms that are essential for maintaining proper functions of mitochondria include mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics and mitophagy. Previously, Syntaxin 4 (STX4) traditionally considered a cell surface protein known for glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, was also identified at the outer mitochondrial membrane. STX4 enrichment was sufficient to reverse Type 2 diabetes-associated mitochondrial damage in skeletal muscle by inactivation of mitochondrial fission. However, whether STX4 could modulate skeletal muscle mitochondrial homeostasis through MQC mechanisms involving mitochondrial biogenesis or mitophagy remains to be determined. Methods To determine the requirements of STX4 in mitochondrial structure, function and MQC processes of biogenesis and mitophagy, we implemented our in-house generated inducible skeletal muscle-specific STX4-knockout (skmSTX4-iKO) mice (Stx4fl/fl; Tg(HSA-rtTA/TRE-Cre)/B6) and STX4-depleted immortalized L6.GLUT4myc myotubes via siRNA knockdown (siSTX4).

STX4 ablation in muscle also impaired mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (****p<0.0001). Mitochondrial morphological damage was heterogenous in STX4 depleted muscle, presenting with small fragmented mitochondria (****p<0.0001) and deceased electron transport chain (ETC) abundance (CI ***p<0.001, CII *p<0.05, CIV **p<0.01) in oxidative soleus muscle, while glycolytic TA fibers display enlarged swollen mitochondria (****p<0.0001) with no change in ETC abundance.

For MQC, both skmSTX4-iKO male mice (*p<0.05) and siSTX4 L6.GLUT4myc myotubes (*p<0.05) showed decreased mitochondrial DNA levels alongside reduced mRNA expression of mitochondrial biogenesis genes Ppargc1a (PGC1-a, *p<0.05) and Tfam (*p<0.05) in skmSTX4-iKO soleus muscle and PGC1-a; (mRNA *p<0.05, protein ***p<0.001), NRF1 (mRNA and protein *p<0.05) and Tfam (mRNA *p<0.05) in siSTX4 L6.GLUT4myc myotubes.

One key trait is suspension-proficiency, or the ability of cells to proliferate in non-adherent culture conditions, to achieve high viable cell densities and streamline cell harvests. The limited success with suspension adaptations of animal cells for cultivated meat restricts the number of non-adherent cell lines suitable for cost-efficient biomass production. Here, we investigated transcriptional profiles of chicken embryonic fibroblasts (DF-1s) as they progressed from adherent to suspension culture using time-series RNA sequencing. From this analysis, we identified that DF-1s adapt to their non-adherent conditions by suppressing non-essential metabolism and tightly regulating cell junctions in response to oxidative stress and cell detachment. Based on these findings, we propose a novel mechanism enabling suspension proficiency in DF-1s, where mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38{delta} sequesters TEA domain (TEAD) proteins to the cytoplasm and promotes Yes-associated protein (YAP) binding to Forkhead box protein 1 (FoxO1), simultaneously causing cell-matrix dissociation and antioxidant production.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a promising environmental education tool because it enables easy and comprehensive biodiversity assessment through simple water sampling. Despite several citizen-based surveys using eDNA analysis, minimal attention has been paid to its educational effectiveness. In this study, we examined the educational feasibility of eDNA analysis by conducting an environmental education program that incorporated eDNA-based local fish surveys in three high schools in Japan. Through detailed questionnaire surveys conducted before and after the program, we verified whether our program increased student interest in biodiversity and ecosystem services. In the program, students proactively identified diverse fish species living in the survey area by simply collecting water. The questionnaire survey results showed that student knowledge of and interest in biodiversity and ecosystem services increased after the program. Students became aware of local fish diversity and expressed their motivation to engage in conservation activities. We confirmed the educational impact of the program not only at the end but also immediately following the water sampling experience. Synthesis and applications. These results provide the first empirical evidence of the positive effects of eDNA analysis on student environmental awareness and engagement.

Because eDNA analysis can be applied to diverse target taxa that are unique to a given area, similar environmental education programs can be conducted for various citizen groups worldwide. Our research also suggested that eDNA-based environmental education was effective for younger generations with varying levels of interest and experience in nature, showing significant potential for addressing the extinction of natural experiences and motivating citizens to participate in ecosystem conservation activities.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

We performed multi-omic profiling of plasma proteins, and serum metabolites and lipids in acutely ill hospitalised and well children in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Using network-based clustering and mixed-effects modelling, we identified common and syndrome-specific omics responses to acute illness. We found that malnutrition often modifies host responses to disease. Although the internal structure of individual omics modules was largely preserved between ill and well children, the interactions between these preserved modules were markedly reorganised during acute illness. Compared to well children, biological systems in hospitalised children were more interconnected, exhibiting denser cross-omics interactions.

In the current preregistered study, we examine dynamic connectivity correlates of self-reported rumination in the largest sample of adolescents to date (n = 443, containing clinical and non-clinical individuals). Notably, the adult model failed to generalize to our sample. In addition, linear models trained on default-mode network (DMN) connectivity, as well as whole-brain connectome models, failed to generalize to held-out data. In an exploratory random forest analysis, we found significant prediction performance of a model where increased variability between DMN-cerebellum, DMN-dorsal attention network, and DMN-DMN connections was nominally associated with higher rumination.

Cognitive deficits in IBS have been linked to attentional biases, particularly towards somatic and symptom-related cues. Despite increasing interest in understanding these cognitive processes, the specific patterns of attentional biases and their relationship with anxiety in IBS remain inadequately explored. Method: This study employed a dot-probe task to compare attentional biases toward somatic (bloating, pain) and social threat cues (angry/disgusted faces) in 15 patients with IBS, 15 individuals with high anxiety (HA) and 15 healthy controls (HC). Participants completed two tasks (Body/Face) with 500 ms stimulus exposure. Attentional bias indices were analyzed using mixed-design ANOVAs controlling for anxiety (STAI) and IBS symptom severity (IBS-SSS). Results: Patients with IBS exhibited significant avoidance of bloating-related stimuli compared to HC (p = .013), but not pain-related cues. Anxiety modulated attentional processing in IBS (p = .015) and HC (p = .013). HA showed no significant biases. IBS patients demonstrated slower overall reaction times than HC (p= .024), suggesting cognitive load. A positive IBS severity-anxiety correlation was observed in IBS (r = 0.574 p = .020). Conclusions The findings demonstrate that IBS is associated with selective avoidance of bloating-related stimuli, driven by a maladaptive interplay between hyper-precise symptom expectations and interoceptive noise a mechanism distinct from anxiety-related attentional patterns. While anxiety amplifies this avoidance, it does not independently account for the cognitive profile of IBS. These results underscore the gut-brain axis role in shaping cognitive-emotional processing.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

However, as we approach the 2030 deadline, global food security, a multidimensional challenge, remains unsolved. With a growing human population, food demand will likely increase, leading to more intensive agricultural practices that put bees and their pollination services at risk. Conserving bees is, thus, crucial to ensuring our food security. A promising solution is cultivating floral plantings alongside crops, which can enhance ecosystem services such as pollination. However, floral plantings may also compete with crops for bees. To optimize their benefits, we need to understand when floral plantings facilitate bee spillover to crops, supporting both bee conservation and agricultural productivity. To address this, we synthesized existing knowledge using a research weaving approach, which combines bibliometric and systematic mapping. Our synthesis suggests that the effects of floral plantings result from a complex interplay of factors, including crop type, bee species, floral planting composition, and environmental conditions. To clarify this interplay, we propose an integrative hypothesis to guide future studies. Finally, our results highlight the need for stronger collaboration among researchers to better understand the role of floral plantings in ecological intensification.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

A striking example of such nature-culture interactions are the living root-bridges of Meghalaya, India, where Khasi people ingeniously train the aerial roots of Ficus elastica across river valleys to form natural bridges. These structures, currently under consideration for UNESCO World Heritage recognition, exemplify sustainable resource use in one of the wettest and most landslide-prone regions of the world. However, increasing tourism and unregulated construction is threatening to this nature culture relationship in a biodiversity hotspot. In such situations, understanding the factors governing the geneflow is vital to the preservation of interactions between the pollinating fig wasps, the fig tree and its seed dispersers. Despite its ecological and cultural significance, little is known about the population biology or dispersal potential of F. elastica. Here, we investigated dispersal potential of natural populations of F. elastica across Meghalaya. Using ddRAD-SNP genotyping (~12K SNPs from 308 individuals), we detected four genetic clusters corresponding to E. Khasi, W. Khasi, W. Jaintia, and Ribhoi hills. Redundancy analysis and resistance modelling revealed that wind regimes and topography jointly structure these populations, enabling gene flow within but not across river valleys. Analysis of spatial distribution of related individuals indicates short dispersal distance of 1-4km varying across different populations. Given F. elastica association with riparian ecosystems, and with UNESCO recognition pending, our study underscores the need for strict guidelines to curb habitat destruction and ensure the long-term survival of both the species and its cultural legacy.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Replication stress is a common cause of CNVs. Despite the prevailing model that CNVs arise from DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), there has been no assay that directly perturbs presumed DSB sources and measures CNV output. Here, we identified a subset of recurrent DNA break clusters (RDCs) as a causal factor for CNV formation. In murine neural progenitor cells under replication stress, mapping the formation of CNVs revealed their location in RDC regions that contain actively transcribed genes. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated transcriptional suppression abrogated both RDC and CNV formation, but does not alter their replication timing. We found that DNA polymerase theta (Pol {theta}), a protector against CNV formation, plays a critical but context-dependent role upstream of RDC formation. Chemically inhibiting the activity of Pol {theta} reduced end filling and micro-homology-mediated end joining in XRCC4/P53-deficient cells. Conversely, Pol {theta} inhibition led to elevated DSB density detection at RDC-containing loci in wild-type neural stem and progenitor cells, suggesting its role in preventing transcription-replication conflicts.

Here, we demonstrate that transient inhibition of Ataxia-Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) kinase markedly enhances KI efficiency in mouse HSCs genome-edited with Cas9/RNP and AAV donor DNA. Phosphoproteomic analysis and capillary western blotting revealed that ATM inhibition suppressed the Cas9-AAV-induced ATM activation and subsequent DNA damage response, reduced p53-dependent apoptosis and preserved knock-in competent cells. In transplantation experiments, ATM inhibition preserved long-term engrafting genome-edited HSCs, increasing their frequency from ~0.3% to ~40% in secondary recipients - a >100-fold enhancement compared to untreated cells. Furthermore, in an X-SCID mouse model, ATM inhibition enhanced KI efficiency and restored expression of IL-2 receptor {gamma} chain (CD132).

This release integrates manually delineated cortical regions from 10 myelin-stained brains to generate a generalized cortical parcellation. Subcortical regions from a previous version (BMA2017) and a state-of-the-art cerebellum atlas (University of Pittsburgh) were also incorporated, resulting in a comprehensive whole-brain parcellation of 636 regions. To enhance cross-modal registration accuracy, we implemented artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques, including CycleGAN and Pix2Pix for image translation and segmentation. These methods enabled accurate alignment across myelin, Nissl, block-face, and MRI modalities by providing both visual similarity and anatomically meaningful constraints. The atlas package includes population-average templates for myelin and Nissl staining (based on 10 individuals), a new ex vivo MRI standard space constructed from 91 brains, and an in vivo average brain from 446 individuals. Additionally, flat map projections and surface models (outer, mid, and inner cortical layers) are provided, facilitating multi-modal integration and spatial analysis.

In other cells, altered BCAA metabolism promotes ferroptosis, a PAH-inducing metabolic pathway. However, the interplay between BCAAs, lung ferroptosis, and PAH is unexplored, as is the impact of PAH severity on liver molecular regulation, a key unknown as recent clinical data highlight the importance of the lung-right heart-liver axis in PAH outcomes. Methods: Human metabolomic and transcriptomic studies examined BCAA metabolism and ferroptosis pathways. The relationship between BCAAs and ferroptotic-phenotypes in PASMCs was evaluated. Multi-omics and physiological analyses evaluated how modulation of BCAA catabolism impacted preclinical PAH multi-organ physiology. Confocal microscopy and proteomic analyses assessed hepatic alterations in human PAH. Results: Metabolomic analyses identified alterations in BCAA metabolites across multiple physiological gradients in patients with pulmonary vascular disease. RNA sequencing demonstrated deficits in the BCAA catabolic and ferroptosis pathways in PAH lungs and smooth muscle cells. In vitro, excess BCAAs induced mitochondrial fragmentation, reactive oxygen species generation, and lipid peroxidation in PASMC. Moreover, BCAAs promoted PASMC death, which ferrostatin-1, a ferroptosis antagonist, rescued. BT2, a small-molecule inducer of BCAA catabolism, reduced PAH severity, improved RV function, and enhanced maximal exercise capacity in monocrotaline rats. BT2 blunted pro-ferroptotic changes in lung metabolites and proteins, and combatted peri-vascular complement deposition. In the liver, BT2 blocked mechanical shear stress phenotypes including hepatocyte nuclear expansion and restructured mitochondrial protein regulation and the metabolomic signature. Additionally, a low BCAA diet modestly combatted preclinical PAH severity. Finally, human PAH livers exhibited increased hepatocyte nuclear size and derangements in liver metabolic regulation. Conclusions: Impaired BCAA metabolism promotes PAH via ferroptosis. PAH severity is associated with hepatic pathological shear stress phenotypes and metabolic alterations, which are combatted by a BCAA-targeted therapy.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that the transcription elongation factor Spt5 determines elongation complex composition to promote productive elongation and the transition to termination. Using an unbiased genetic screen and genomic approaches in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we provide evidence that dephosphorylation of the Spt5 C-terminal repeat domain (CTR) by the Glc7/PP1 phosphatase is required to dislodge Paf1C from RNAPII near the cleavage and polyadenylation site (CPS). Mutations in Paf1C or the Spt5 CTR that dissociate Paf1C from RNAPII bypass the requirement for two critical regulatory subunits of Glc7. Depletion of Glc7 causes aberrant retention of Paf1C past the CPS and increased readthrough transcription, which is fully suppressed by Paf1C mutations. We conclude that Paf1C antagonizes termination and Glc7-mediated restructuring of the RNAPII elongation complex is a critical step in transcription termination.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Here, quantitative imaging of T cells interacting with tumor cells presenting either native or clinically relevant bi-specific TCR ligands, revealed that they form multiple sub-micron sized 'close contacts' with their targets. The contacts were stabilised by the adhesion protein CD2, but efficient ligand detection required both CD2 and integrin ligation. CD45 was excluded from close contacts at the time of ZAP70 recruitment and signaling, but only partially (30-40%). A single-cell, mass cytometric analysis showed that this change in kinase/phosphatase activity provoked strong T-cell activation and potent cytotoxicity via very small changes in signaling fluxes. Spatial stochastic simulations suggested that the proximal T-cell signaling network is optimised for efficient antigen discrimination in the setting of partial CD45 exclusion.

These bottom-dwelling organisms account for the largest fraction of animal diversity in our seas, playing vital roles in nutrient cycling, sediment stabilization and the broader food webs. Historically, the behavioral repertoire of benthic animals attached permanently to the sea floor has been considered as extremely limited (if at all present), reflecting an evolutionary adaptation to their sessile lifestyle and simplified nervous systems. Here, we overturn this view by studying the spontaneous and stimulus evoked behavioral repertoire of the basal chordate Ciona intestinalis which has a benthic sessile adult stage. We found that Ciona adults transition between three main postural engagement behavioral states. These are defined by different body part kinematics and postural dynamics characterised by changes in body shape configuration as opposed to locomotion. Transitions between states can occur probabilistically in spontaneously behaving animals suggesting that they can be internally generated by the simple brain of an adult Ciona. Importantly, using spatiotemporal embedding of postural features, we constructed a behavioral space for Ciona adults, which was divided into 18 stereotyped behavioral modes revealing the unappreciated richness of adult Ciona behaviors. Our analysis showed that Ciona adults can deploy in a selective manner these behavioral modules to elicit distinct responses to different mechanical stimuli, suggesting the presence of a sensory context dependent regulation of behavior in these benthic organisms.

S.; Shi, C.; Kozlova, E.; Jadhav, S. P.", "abstract": "Inferential reasoning is a vital cognitive ability that enables animals to navigate novel situations by leveraging existing relational knowledge of memory schema. Transitive inference (TI), a classic paradigm for studying this process, tests the ability of subjects to infer relationships within a value hierarchy (e.g., A > B > C > D > E) after being trained only on adjacent pairs (e.g., A-B, B-C). While the ability to perform transitive inference is well-conserved across species, the neural mechanisms supporting it, particularly the role of the hippocampal-prefrontal circuit, remain underexplored due to limitations in existing rodent TI paradigms. These paradigms often rely on manual trial setups with pot-digging choice behavior using odors that makes it difficult to pinpoint the moment of inferential deliberation. To address these challenges, we developed a novel automated spatial TI task for rats using a radial maze, which leverages their natural foraging behaviors and includes a dedicated deliberation zone. We found that most rats successfully learned the premise pairs and successfully inferred, with performance comparable to studies using traditional odor-based tasks. We also investigated vicarious trial and error (VTE), a behavioral correlate of deliberation during choice trajectories. We found that VTE behavior was elevated during the initial stages of learning with access to new maze arms, when the first novel premise pair was introduced, and for incorrect trials, corresponding to hypothesized association of VTE events with uncertainty. Further, rats also had elevated VTE behavior on inference testing day for the inference test pair (B-D) compared to the other inner premise pairs (B-C & C-D) on their first testing day, suggesting the need to deliberate during inferential reasoning. Thus, VTEs may reflect deliberation in addition to uncertainty.

To investigate how extracellular matrix (ECM) topographical features influence osteosarcoma behaviour, polylactic acid-based microparticles were engineered with bone-mimetic stiffness and defined surface topographies, guided by a Design-of-Experiments (DoE) approach. This enabled systematic variation of microparticle architecture (8-63 m diameter; 2-13 m dimple size) for studying the impact of surface topography on osteosarcoma cell behaviour in 3D culture, with doxorubicin treatment as a functional test to evaluate the effect of 3D topographical cues on chemotherapy sensitivity. Topography modulated cell-microparticle aggregation dynamics. At 96 hours post-seeding, MG-63 cells displayed significantly reduced metabolic activity on all 3D microparticle designs, with heterogeneously dimpled-topography cultures displaying significantly lower DNA content than conventional 2D cultures. In U2OS cells, metabolic activity was significantly lower on smooth microparticles compared to dimpled designs, with all 3D cultures showing significantly lower DNA content versus 2D. Response to doxorubicin was more strongly influenced by culture dimensionality than surface topography, underscoring the importance of 3D context. Significant metabolic differences between 3D and 2D cultures were observed, including the enrichment of amino acid related pathways and downregulation of ferroptosis signatures in 3D microparticle cultures.

Although trained immunity has been well-characterized in myeloid lineage cells, its presence in innate lymphoid cells, particularly natural killer (NK) cells, remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that a single dose of Salmonella YB1, an attenuated candidate anti-cancer vaccine strain, provides long-lasting protection against cancer metastasis in mice by inducing trained natural killer (NK) cells. Functional assays coupled with multi-omics analysis revealed that Salmonella-trained NK (stNK) cells establish an enduring reprogrammed epigenome characterized by enhanced pro-survival signaling and immune effector functions, resulting in more potent IFN-{gamma} release and cytotoxicity upon secondary stimulation. We further revealed that IL-12 and IL-18 are essential but insufficient for this NK cell training effect. Crucially, stNK cells far outperform the common immune checkpoint therapies, including PD-1 and TIGIT blockade, in suppressing metastasis, underscoring the unique immunological mechanisms in combating metastasis. These findings uncover a novel long-term anti-metastatic function of trained immunity in NK cells, highlighting its potential as an effective antitumor strategy.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

P.; Zoghbi, H. Y.; Bird, A. P.", "abstract": "Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause the severe neurological disorder Rett syndrome. A cluster of frameshift-causing C-terminal deletions (CTDs) lead to loss of ~100 amino acids at the C-terminus of the MeCP2 protein, and account for approximately 10% of RTT-causing mutations. The pathogenicity of C-terminal deletions (CTDs) is unexpected, as this C-terminal domain is non-essential in mice. Utilising databases of pathogenic and benign human MECP2 mutations, we find that some individuals with apparently typical CTDs do not exhibit Rett syndrome, confirming that C-terminal truncations are not intrinsically pathogenic. Using human DNA sequence data and mouse models, we demonstrate that pathogenicity results from a drastic reduction in MeCP2 levels and is determined by the presence of the short amino acid motif proline-proline-stop (-PPX) at the C-terminus, which results from a shift to the +2 reading frame. Individuals with CTDs that shift to the +1 frame avoid this motif and do not develop Rett syndrome. Mutating the stop codon of the PPX motif to tryptophan rescues MeCP2 expression and RTT-like phenotypes in a CTD mouse model. Finally, we demonstrate that an adenine base editor can efficiently introduce this tryptophan substitution in cultured cells. Overall, our findings uncover a simple and reliable prognostic distinction between benign and pathogenic CTDs and provide proof-of-concept for an editing strategy that potentially corrects all disease-causing CTD mutations.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

OM demonstrate resistance to systemic therapy, suggesting distinct molecular tumorigenesis. Gene expression profiling and transcriptomic analysis were performed to distinguish OM, PM, and primary CRC (pCRC) and identify potential therapeutic targets. Methods: RNA sequencing data were obtained from the Total Cancer Care database. After filtering out low-expressed genes, raw counts of retained genes were normalized in trimmed mean of M-values and then log2-transformed. Genes with a |Log2FC|>0.58 and adjusted p-value <0.05 were considered dysregulated. In silico motif enrichment analysis of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) on growth regulating estrogen receptor binding 1 (GREB1) was conducted. Results: There were 115 patients with tissue from OM (n=6), PM (n=4), and pCRC (n=105). Among upregulated genes, LAMC3, SCUBE1, and GREB1 had the highest differential expression in OM compared to PM, and PEG3, C7, and GREB1 had the highest differential expression in OM compared to pCRC (all p<0.001). GREB1 was upregulated in OM compared to PM and pCRC. There are two estrogen response element (ERE) sites within the promoter region of GREB1. ESR1 transcription factor was shown to bind to these ERE (p<0.001). Conclusions: Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated clear molecular distinction between OM, PM and pCRC. We identified upregulation of GREB1 in OM compared to PM and pCRC. GREB1 contains both ERE and ESR1 in the upstream promoter regions implying potential upstream transcription regulation mediated by ESR1. GREB1 may represent a novel, hormonal target in treatment of OM in CRC.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

However, resistance to BET inhibitors (BETi) limits their clinical utility, necessitating a better understanding of adaptive mechanisms. We identified BRD2 upregulation as a conserved response to BET inhibition across multiple cancer types and hypothesized that BRD2 compensates for BRD4 loss, sustaining essential transcriptional programs upon treatment. Consistent with this, BRD2 knockdown sensitized cancer cells to BETi in vitro, and combining BRD2 depletion and JQ1 treatment significantly impaired tumor growth in vivo. At the chromatin level, BRD2 and BRD4 ChIP-seq analysis of pancreatic cancer cells showed consistent BRD4 loss from chromatin after JQ1 treatment, while BRD2 displacement differed by sensitivity. Resistant cells maintained higher BRD2 occupancy than sensitive cells, suggesting a link between BRD2 retention and drug response. Mechanistically, NFYA mediates BRD2 up-regulation as NFYA depletion abrogated BRD2 upregulation upon BETi treatment. Collectively, our findings establish BRD2 as a critical mediator of adaptive resistance to BETi in pan-cancer and identify NFYA as a novel transcriptional regulator of this process. Co-targeting BRD2 or its regulatory network offers a rational strategy to enhance the durability and efficacy of BET-based therapies.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

E.; Palmisani, S.; Obara, I.", "abstract": "Objectives: Epidural stimulation of the spinal cord evokes distinct electrophysiological responses that can be recorded epidurally. Here, we characterized evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs), doublets (secondary or tertiary ECAPs, likely of different physiological origin than primary ECAPs), evoked synaptic activity potentials (ESAPs), and electromyographic (EMG) signals in preclinical models. Our objective was to clarify the features and distinct physiological origins of these signals, in order to advance mechanistic studies and support clinical applications of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy. Materials and Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-440 g) were implanted with two epidural leads (caudal and rostral; each with eight electrodes) and received monopolar, biphasic stimulation (200 s pulse width) at 2 and 50 Hz, with current increased stepwise to motor threshold. Rhesus macaques (11.5 and 10.2 kg) were implanted with a single 12-electrode epidural lead and stimulated using either tripolar, triphasic pulses at 10 Hz (100 s) or tripolar, biphasic pulses at 3 Hz (80 s) up to 3xECAP threshold. Recordings were taken from non-stimulating electrodes. Results: ECAPs and EMG signals were recorded across multiple spinal segments in both rats (L1-T7) and macaques (L2-T11). Doublets presented as complex waveforms with multiple negative peaks, two in rats and three in macaques, likely representing distinct ECAPs at T11-T6 in a rat and L1-T11 in macaques. ESAPs, detectable in rats, showed anatomical specificity, over the L1/T13 vertebrae with peak responses at L1. Signal analysis included activation thresholds, amplitudes, latencies, and conduction velocities. Conclusions: This study outlines electrophysiological signals evoked by SCS in terms of their waveform, recruitment thresholds, and putative physiological origins. We propose that, to the extent these signals reflect different aspects of spinal processing and may serve as biomarkers of dysregulated nociceptive pathways, as well as indicators of SCS efficacy or potential side effects.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

To investigate the contribution of the 5-HT3A subtype, we trained wild-type (C57BL/6J) and 5-HT3A receptor knockout (Htr3a-/-) mice across a series of operant conditioning tasks and compared their behavioral performance. Following nose-poke training, both groups underwent a rule-switching task, extinction tests under fixed ratio (FR) and variable ratio (VR) reinforcement schedules, and a progressive ratio (PR) task to assess persistence. We found that 5-HT3A receptor knockout mice exhibited reduced responding during the extinction and PR tasks, suggesting diminished behavioral persistence. Notably, however, knockout mice acquired the new rule in the switching task significantly faster than wild-type controls, indicating enhanced cognitive flexibility. These findings suggest that the 5-HT3A receptor plays a role in regulating the balance between behavioral persistence and flexibility, normally biasing this balance toward persistence under normal physiological conditions. This mechanism may underlie the therapeutic effect of 5-HT3A receptor antagonists in treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

In this work, we show that by maximizing mutual information one layer at a time, efficient coding recovers several features of canonical olfactory processing under realistic biophysical assumptions. We also explore the settings in which noncanonical olfaction may be advantageous.

E.; Jacobs, J.", "abstract": "Place cells, first identified in the rat hippocampus as neurons that fire selectively at specific locations, are central to investigations of the neural underpinnings of spatial navigation. With recent work with human patients, identifying and characterizing place cells across species has become increasingly important for understanding the extent to which decades of rodent research generalize to humans and uncovering principles of spatial cognition. One challenge, however, is that detection methods differ: rodent studies often rely on spatial information (SI), whereas human studies employ analysis of variance (ANOVA) - based approaches. These methodological differences may affect the identified place cell population, which complicates how their properties are interpreted and cross-species comparisons. To address this, we systematically applied multiple detection pipelines to human and rat datasets, supported by simulations that vary place-field properties. Our analyses and simulations demonstrate that spatial information and ANOVA-based approaches are responsive to distinct place field properties: spatial information primarily reflects the contrast between peak and average firing rates, while ANOVA emphasizes consistency across trials. Across species, rodent place cells revealed a broad spectrum of spatial tuning, including strongly tuned neurons with high spatial information (SI) and high ANOVA values. In contrast, human place cells lacked this strongly tuned population and exhibited a narrower distribution of tuning scores, concentrated at the lower end of both spatial tuning metrics. Despite these differences, both species had an overlapping population of neurons with weaker yet consistent spatial tuning, which may support important functional roles such as generalization and mixed selectivity. Together, our study provides a roadmap showing how spatial tuning metrics shape place cell detection and interpretation, while underscoring the functional importance of weaker-tuned neurons in cross-species comparisons.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Although both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons in the IC project to the medial geniculate body (MGB), the detailed neurocircuitry and neurochemical properties of GABAergic projection neurons remain poorly understood. In this study, glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67)-Cre mice and the viral vector were utilized to selectively visualize the axonal projections of GABAergic neurons in the IC. These neurons project predominantly to the medial division of MGB (MGv) and contralateral IC and minorly to the ventral nucleus of the trapezoid body. Importantly, GABAergic projections from both lemniscal and non-lemniscal regions of the IC primarily targeted the lemniscal division of the MGB, whereas those projections from the external cortex of the IC, which is part of the non-lemniscal pathway, additionally extended into non-lemniscal MGB subregions. Using a retrograde tracer, a substantial proportion of GABAergic projection neurons targeting the MGB and contralateral IC were positive for several neurochemical markers, implying that some GABAergic neurons send axon collaterals to both targets. Notably, GABAergic neurons constituted 10% of the total neuronal population in the IC, whereas GABAergic neurons accounted for approximately 20% of IC neurons projecting to the MGB or contralateral IC. Our results suggest that GABAergic projection neurons are more involved in the IC to MGB pathway than would be expected based on their proportion in the IC and may exert widespread influence on auditory processing via direct inhibition of the MGv and indirect modulation through suppression of the contralateral IC.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

We see a wide range of possible applications, such as for instance the investigation of learning in social interactions, which we present here as an example.

Co-learning animals engaged more often in some prosocial interactions with their teammates than with other animals, but they did overall not interact with each other more frequently than with individual learners.

We show that this rule can quickly produce highly flexible nonlinear dynamics using sparse, low-dimensional instructive signals while also admitting precise mathematical interpretation inspired by the well-known support vector machine. Using adaptive control theory, we additionally derive an online rule allowing such networks to learn using instructive signals guided by real-time feedback. Thus, heterosynaptic instruction-mediated plasticity is a powerful, biologically plausible and analytically tractable mechanism for the rapid learning of flexible dynamics, shedding light on the neural basis of complex adaptive behavior.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

However, whether distinct emotional expressions reflect discrete neural processes or arise from varying combinations of underlying affective dimensions such as arousal and valence remains a subject of investigation. Crucially, these accounts need not be mutually exclusive: different brain regions may encode emotional expressions along both categorical and dimensional axes to varying degrees. To test this hypothesis, we probed different brain systems involved in emotion recognition - the ventral attentional network and the cortical limbic system centered on the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) - to investigate the extent to which these networks and their subregions encode emotional facial expressions in terms of (1) perceived arousal, (2) arousal+valence, or (3) six discrete emotion categories (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pain, sadness). To this aim, we modelled the fMRI signal from perceiving movies of facial emotional expressions with ratings for either arousal, arousal+valence or emotion category using representational similarity analysis (RSA) - a method that aims at assessing which ratings model better represents how the perception of facial expressions is reflected by the fMRI parameter estimates across all the voxels within a brain region. This analysis showed that regions in the vmPFC network, including the subgenual cingulate and the medial OFC, are sensitive to ratings for distinct emotion category and for arousal+valence - significantly more so for the former - while they fail to show sensitivity for arousal ratings alone. In the ventral attentional network, the mid-posterior insula showed a similar profile, while the most posterior and ventral insular show evidence of encoding arousal+valence, but not for emotion category or arousal alone. Our findings support the idea that the vmPFC and the mid-posterior insula play a role in encoding emotion-specific and valence representations beyond general arousal processing. These results contribute to understanding how integrative brain regions support emotional empathy and social cognition.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Some bacteria have beneficial functions, for example providing nutrients, whereas others act as pathogens. These bacteria are sensed by host cells to induce adaptive changes in physiology and behavior. While immune and intestinal cells detect bacterial signals through well-characterized mechanisms, recent studies indicate that neurons can also directly sense bacterial signals. However, the bacterial sensory mechanisms in neurons are less well understood. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the enteric sensory neuron NSM innervates the pharyngeal lumen and is directly activated by bacterial food ingestion; in turn, NSM releases serotonin to induce feeding-related behaviors. However, the molecular identities of the bacterial signals that activate NSM are unknown. To identify these signals, we systematically probed bacterial macromolecules from nutritive bacteria using biochemical approaches and GC-MS identification. We find that polysaccharides from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria are sufficient to activate NSM. We further identify peptidoglycan from gram-positive bacteria as a specific component capable of activating NSM. NSM responses to polysaccharides require the acid-sensing ion channels DEL-3 and DEL-7, which localize to its sensory dendrite in the pharyngeal lumen. Ingestion of bacterial polysaccharides enhances feeding rates and reduces locomotion, matching the known effects of NSM on behavior. We also examine bacterial signals from pathogenic bacteria that can infect and kill C. elegans. This approach identifies prodigiosin, a metabolite from pathogenic Serratia marcescens, as a bacterial cue that prevents NSM activation by nutritive bacterial signals. This study identifies molecular signals that underlie neuronal recognition of nutritive bacteria in the alimentary canal and competing signals from a pathogenic bacterial strain that mask this form of recognition.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

L.; Sammari, M.; Ajal, C.; Le Cor, A.; Russier, M.; Debanne, D.; Incontro, S.", "abstract": "Somatostatin (SST) is a neuropeptide known to inhibit both neuronal excitability and excitatory synaptic transmission in principal neurons. While SST is expressed in some GABAergic interneurons such as Oriens-Lacunosum Moleculare (O-LM) cells, the precise conditions governing SST release remain poorly defined. We show here that, in the presence of GABAA receptor antagonist, single O-LM interneurons of CA1 are able to inhibit pyramidal neuron excitability when O-LM cells fire at frequencies above 20 Hz. This inhibition is suppressed by the SST receptor antagonist cyclo-SST and is absent when the O-LM interneuron is located more than 150 micormeters from the pyramidal cell. Likewise, a single O-LM cell was also able to inhibit the intrinsic excitability of another O-LM cell, provided the two cells are in proximity. Exogeneous application of SST transiently inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission and intrinsic excitability in O-LM interneurons through SST1 and SST2, respectively. Notably, this transient inhibition became sustained when clathrin-dependent endocytosis of SST receptors was blocked. Blocking of SST receptors reduced NMDA receptor-mediated responses, prevented induction of both synaptic and intrinsic potentiation in pyramidal neurons and reduced the coherence of theta oscillations. These findings reveal that SST released by O-LM interneurons constitutes an additional inhibitory mechanism, modulating both synaptic excitation and intrinsic excitability beyond the transient inhibition mediated by GABA release.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated whether minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic that modulates microglial activity, could prevent or attenuate the long-term effects of adolescent stress on behavior, parvalbumin (PV)-expressing (+) interneurons (PVIs), perineuronal nets (PNNs), and microglia in adulthood. Male mice were exposed to a 10-day footshock stress protocol during adolescence (postnatal days 31-40) and treated with minocycline (30 mg/kg; i.p.) either during or after stress exposure. Behavioral assessments in adulthood revealed that adolescent stress impaired sociability, social memory, and object recognition memory, which were attenuated by minocycline treatment during or after adolescent stress exposure. Stress also reduced the number of PV+, PNN+, and PV+/PNN+ cells in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHip). These effects were prevented by minocycline administration at both time points. No significant long-lasting changes were observed in microglial number, density, or spatial distribution in either region. However, minocycline treatment modulated microglial morphology in a region- and timing-dependent manner, with increased microglial area observed in the PFC and subtle alterations in circularity in the vHip. These findings suggest that adolescent stress induces enduring impairments in PVIs and behavior, possibly through transient microglial intervention and PNN degradation. Minocycline treatment during or after stress was effective in preventing these changes, supporting its potential as a therapeutic strategy to mitigate the long-term consequences of adolescent stress and to reduce vulnerability to stress-related psychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we characterize this attentional control process with a model of parallel belief states and test it with a task requiring the learning and updating of attention to features with varying selection histories and motivational costs. We found that exploring and exploiting features was accounted for by a model that tracks the latent beliefs about the relevance of multiple features in parallel. These parallel belief states accounted for the fast learning of feature-based attention, for perseverative selection history effects for features that were previously relevant, and for enhanced learning performance when the motivational costs of making errors increased. Taken together, these results quantify how multiple parallel belief states guide exploration and exploitation of feature-based attention during learning.

Here we exposed groups of cockroaches (Blaptica dubia) to three humidities and quantified their social networks. We repeated our design across multiple groups with individuals reassigned to different groups and used machine vision analysis of images to extract 152,800 records of associations across 16 different groups. 116 unique individuals contributed >4,500 individual social network measures and 192 measures of entire networks. Lower humidity led to individuals that had slightly better connectedness to the whole network, but otherwise did not impact individual or group-level phenotypes. Individuals showed some consistency in mean behaviours (12-39%) but scant consistency in plasticity (0-9%). In contrast, groups showed less consistency in mean behaviours than individuals (0-26%) but showed relatively higher among-group differences in plasticity compared to individuals (0-22%). Patterns of group-level variance in individual traits matched patterns of variance in characteristics of entire networks, suggesting these two approaches for quantifying group phenotypes are compatible. While consistency in individual mean behaviour is the norm across taxa, consistency in group-level plasticity is less well understood and may be an emergent phenomenon of collective dynamics that deserves further investigation. Using automated marker recognition techniques such as machine vision allows us to collect the large datasets necessary to simultaneously test hypotheses at the individual and group level and so can be more widely adopted.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "The rapid evolution of SARS-CoV-2 presents significant challenges for modeling viral dynamics, driven by lineage diversification and region-specific mutation patterns. While phylogenetic trees are traditionally used for evolutionary inference, the massive volume of SARS-CoV-2 genomic data, with many similar sequences and few distinguishing mutations, poses computational and methodological limitations. The quasispecies theory instead models viral evolution as a cloud of mutants, motivating a graph-based representation that better captures the complexity of mutational events. Geographic variation adds another critical layer to this complexity. Mutation trends often differ across regions due to local transmission dynamics, host population structures, and selective pressures. In this study, we present the Mutation Learning Graph (MLG), a directed graph framework that organizes SARS-CoV-2 variants based on their cumulative mutation profiles relative to the reference genome (NC_045512.2), thereby capturing the dynamics of mutation propagation. This structure captures fine-grained mutational transitions and encodes plausible evolutionary relationships among variants. To construct these graphs, we introduce an alignment-aware mutation profiling method and a novel ANCESTOR JOINING algorithm, which incorporates ancestral variants as inferred intermediate nodes to connect observed genomes through biologically coherent mutational paths. We generate MLG datasets for ten geographically and epidemiologically diverse regions and benchmark them on two graph-based tasks: node-level lineage classification and edge-level mutational transition prediction. Using baseline graph neural network architectures (GCN, GraphSAGE, GAT, GGNN, VGAE), we demonstrate how mutation-centric graph structures expose key biological challenges, such as lineage imbalance and location-specific mutation spectra. For node classification, GraphSAGE and GGNN consistently achieved high accuracy (up to 0.96) and AUROC (up to 0.98). In contrast, VGAE and GraphSAGE led the way in link prediction, with AUPRCs of up to 0.96. These results highlight the effectiveness of MLG for capturing biologically meaningful mutation patterns and underscore the importance of localized, mutation-aware modeling for predicting viral mutations and future variant emergence.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Retrospective clinical analysis revealed that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 exhibited increased lung cancer incidence. Using multiple murine lung cancer models, we show that prior severe respiratory viral infections accelerated tumor growth and reduced survival. Mechanistically, prior viral pneumonia epigenetically remodeled the lung to establish a pro-tumor microenvironment, including the local accumulation of SiglecFhi tumor-associated neutrophils, a transcriptionally reprogrammed, immunosuppressive population whose signature predicted poor prognosis in human lung adenocarcinoma. In parallel, epithelial compartments exhibited altered differentiation trajectories, with persistence of injury-associated alveolar intermediates positioned along tumorigenic lineages. We observe sustained chromatin remodeling at key cytokine loci in immune and structure cells, linking inflammatory memory to persistent immune suppression. Therapeutically, combined inhibition of neutrophil recruitment via CXCR2 and PD-L1 signaling restored CD8 T cell infiltration and suppressed tumor growth.

We predicted that the free-living Caballeronia population would increase over time in the presence of its insect partner. We quantified Caballeronia titer in soil microcosms (i) in the presence and absence of L. phyllopus over time, and (ii) at different bug densities. Insect presence resulted in higher soil Caballeronia titer over time. As bug density increased, the soil Caballeronia population also increased. Additionally, soil moisture affected Caballeronia abundance, with moister soil supporting a larger population.

The isolated VL was engineered to form VL double domains to increase its neutralization activity. Several candidates showed binding abilities, whereas only the DE2 VL double-domain treatment showed neutralizing activity against JEV. DE2 was also highly specific to JEV and did not bind to other flaviviruses. Immunocytochemistry results showed that DE2 was co-localized with the endosome 4 h post-infection. Thus, the mechanism of DE2 neutralization involves blocking the E protein from fusing with the endosomal membrane, resulting in the unrelease of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. Docking analysis showed that DE2 was bound to three domains, especially DIII, of the JEV E protein. In contrast, other scFv that were unable to bind to DIII showed no or low neutralizing activity.

While there is redundancy between these two enzymes, it is unclear how they both contribute to glycosylation of the densely glycosylated HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein complex (Env). We found that knocking out STT3A had a profound negative impact on HIV-1 virus production and infectivity while STT3B ablation had no such effect suggesting that STT3A is more important than STT3B for Env glycosylation and preserved function. STT3A/3B knockout (KO) affected the neutralization sensitivity to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) in a strain-specific manner with STT3A-KO increasing susceptibility to VRC01 bNAb for the tested HIV-1 strains. In contrast, for the BG505 strain A virus, it conferred increased resistance to glycan-dependent bNAbs 2G12 and PGT128. For other HIV-1 strains, STT3B-KO also led to resistance to glycan-dependent bNAb PGT151. Site-specific glycan analysis of recombinant Env proteins revealed that STT3A-KO reduced glycan occupancy of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) more globally than STT3B-KO, with certain acceptor sites, including N234 and N386, showing STT3A dependence. In contrast, STT3B-KO appeared to have a more pronounced effect on gp41 glycosylation, suggesting that PNGS located near the C-terminus are more dependent on STT3B.

No significant change was detected in endomysium thickness or area. Furthermore, proteomic analysis did not reveal any group-specific change except for plasma membrane calcium-transporting ATPase 2 being less abundant in the soleus muscles of aged power-trained athletes. Overall, the data show that neither athletic exercise nor age significantly affected the content or composition of the endomysium in human soleus muscle tissue.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Prosthesis control can be seen as a new skill to be learned. To enhance learning, both internal and augmented feedback are exploited. The latter represents external feedback sources that can be designed to enhance learning, e.g. biofeedback. Previous research has shown that augmented feedback protocols can be designed to induce retention by adhering to the guidance hypothesis, but it is not clear yet if that also results in transfer of those skills to prosthesis control. In this study, we test if a training paradigm optimised for retention allows for the transfer of myoelectric skill to prosthesis control. Approach. Twelve limb-intact participants learned a novel myoelectric skill during five one-hour training sessions. To induce retention of the novel myoelectric skill, we used a delayed feedback paradigm. Prosthesis transfer was tested through pre-and post-tests with a prosthesis. Prosthesis control tests included a grasp matching task, the modified box and blocks test, and an object manipulation task, requiring five grasps in total ('power', 'tripod', 'pointer', 'lateral grip', and 'hand open'). Main results. We found that prosthesis control improved significantly following five days of training. Importantly, the prosthesis control metrics were significantly related to the retention metrics during training, but not to the prosthesis performance during the pre-test. Significance. This study shows that transfer of novel, abstract myoelectric control from a computer interface to prosthetic control is possible if the training paradigm is designed to induce retention. These results highlight the importance of approaching myoelectric and prosthetic skills from a skill acquisition standpoint, and open up new avenues for the design of prosthetic training protocols.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

C.-C.", "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, manipulates host gene expression through multiple mechanisms, including disruption of RNA processing. Here, we identify a novel function of the viral nonstructural protein 14 (NSP14) in inducing N7-methylguanosine (m7G) modification in the internal sequences of host mRNA. We demonstrate that NSP14 catalyzes the conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to m7GTP, which is subsequently incorporated into mRNA by RNA polymerase II, resulting in widespread internal m7G modification. This activity is dependent on NSP14's N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) domain and is enhanced by interaction with NSP10. Internal m7G modification by NSP14 predominantly occurs in the nucleus and is conserved across alpha-, beta- and gamma-coronaviruses. Mechanistically, we show that this RNA modification disrupts normal splicing by promoting intron retention and generating novel splice junctions. Importantly, inhibition of m7G modification, through pharmacological targeting of NSP14 or RNA polymerase II, impairs SARS-CoV-2 replication, indicating that the virus hijacks host transcriptomic machinery to support infection. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized epitranscriptomic mechanism by which coronaviruses reprogram host gene expression and suggest that NSP14-induced m7G modification is a potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

However, detailed characterisations required to establish a corresponding reference strain are still lacking. The mouse-adapted CC88 strain JSNZ appears to be an ideal candidate for a reference strain, because CC88 is widespread among laboratory mice and frequently employed in mouse colonisation and infection models. Moreover, JSNZ demonstrates high genetic transformability comparable to that of commonly used laboratory strains. Here, we present a comprehensive genomic and proteomic characterisation of JSNZ. Whole genome sequencing was performed using a combination of short and long reads. Proteomic profiling was conducted under standard laboratory conditions in TSB and RPMI during exponential and stationary growth using LC-MS/MS. The updated, closed genome sequence of JSNZ was integrated into AureoWiki for user-friendly access and direct comparison to long-established reference strains. Genome data revealed a deletion in the restriction endonuclease gene hsdR, likely explaining the observed efficient transformation while retaining DNA modification capabilities. This positions JSNZ as a hub for genetic modification of other CC88 isolates. Proteomic profiling of JSNZ indicated broad similarity to common S. aureus reference strains. However, a striking exception was the novel serine protease Jep, which constituted approximately 75% of the exoproteome in stationary TSB cultures. Overall, these findings affirm JSNZ as a robust and genetically tractable model strain for murine S. aureus infection research and contribute a valuable standardised resource to enhance experimental reproducibility and cross-study consistency in the field.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Testing 94 dietary components in the community model shows these two families compete for overlapping nutritional niches. Notably, Segatella copri, a key Prevotellaceae representative, outcompetes Bacteroidaceae strains when preferred polysaccharides are available. Interestingly, this competitive advantage depends on the presence of Enterobacteriaceae, which synergize with dietary components to promote Segatella dominance. Accordingly, we observe that global Segatella-rich non-Westernized microbiomes correlate with higher Enterobacteriaceae content.

B.", "abstract": "Background: HIV-1 RNA typically declines rapidly after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART); often reaching undetectable levels within a few weeks and remaining undetectable by standard assays. However, some patients on ART have persistent nonsuppressible viremia (NSV) that does not respond to treatment optimization or intensification. NSV can emerge at the time of ART initiation (primary NSV) or after being ART-suppressed (secondary NSV). Here, we examine mechanisms producing primary NSV in four people on ART. Methods: Blood samples were collected from four participants who, despite being adherent to ART, required approximately a year or more to become virologically suppressed. Viral RNA and proviral DNA genomes were sequenced to examine HIV-1 drug resistance, genome intactness and genetic diversity. The ability of HIV-1 Envs to facilitate efficient entry into cells expressing low levels of CD4 (a proxy for macrophage tropism) was assessed. Results: Before ART, the blood contained HIV-1 RNA genomes that were adapted to replication in CD4+ T cells and rapidly decayed after ART initiation. During ART, the blood contained HIV-1 genomes that were drug sensitive, genetically diverse, macrophage-tropic, not evolving and often had defects in vpr. Conclusions: Our results suggest that in individuals with primary NSV, ART stopped virus replication, but large pools of long-lived, HIV-infected macrophage continued to produce virus. This is mechanistically distinct from secondary NSV produced by CD4+ T cell clones. In addition, defects in vpr independently accumulation in macrophage-tropic lineages found in three participants, suggesting that vpr may impact survival of, or virus production from, HIV-infected macrophage.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

We adopted Fragmented and primer-Ligated DsRNA Sequencing (FLDS) method to selectively sequence double-stranded (ds) RNAs, the replicative intermediates of RNA replicons, and to identify cccRNAs among the resulting sequences. From these data, we selected cccRNAs with predicted extensive intramolecular base-pairing, a hallmark of viroid-like elements. ch We employed FLDS to explore metatranscriptomes from acidic hot springs in Japan and discovered a distinct family of Obelisks probably associated with thermoacidophilic bacteria (Hot spring Obelisks, HsObs). The proteins encoded by HsObs, HsOblins, show no significant sequence similarity to previously identified Oblin-1 proteins, but are predicted to adopt a closely similar structure. A comprehensive search of metagenomes for Oblin-1 and HsOblin homologs substantially expanded this family of Obelisk-encoded proteins revealing several distinct subfamilies that share the same core fold. A cccRNA encoding an HsOblin homolog was also detected in a Yellowstone hot spring metatranscriptome.

Six clinical blaNDM-positive Enterobacterales exhibited meropenem MICs between 0.5-2.0 mg/L. Successful transmission of blaNDM into recipient E. coli J53 indicated its presence on plasmids. Conventional Sanger and whole-genome sequencing revealed that no truncation or deletion was observed within blaNDM or its core promoter region up to 120 bp upstream. Quantitative real-time PCR of blaNDM showed significantly lower expression levels of blaNDM, i.e., 0.2-0.5 in study isolates, compared to a clinical blaNDM-possessing isolate (expression=1) exhibiting a high meropenem MIC value (64 mg/L). Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) further demonstrated that these isolates carried a lower copy number of the blaNDM gene, compared to the blaNDM-possessing isolate with high meropenem MIC (64 mg/L). Furthermore, the in vitro time-kill assay exhibited bactericidal efficacy of meropenem >3 log10 decrease in cfu/mL over the 24 hours from the starting inoculum. Administration of meropenem in in vivo neutropenic mice produced a 4-log cfu reduction compared to untreated controls at the start of dosing.

Dietary interventions, such as caloric restriction and periodic fasting, have been shown to enhance metabolic health and extend lifespan in preclinical models. However, inter-individual variation in physiological responses to these interventions, which affects their safety and efficacy when translated to humans, remains poorly understood despite being observed in multiple studies. In this study, we implemented intermittent fasting (IF) for two days per week in 10 inbred strains (n = 800 mice) from the Collaborative Cross (CC). The CC is a multiparent recombinant inbred strain panel that offers a diverse collection of reproducible models to study the genetic control of heterogeneous intervention responses. We conducted longitudinal phenotyping to characterize hundreds of traits, including lifespan, in the CC mice. We demonstrate that sex and genetic background induce variable responses to intermittent fasting across multiple physiological outcomes, including metabolic, hematologic, and immunologic health. Effects of IF on lifespan were sex-specific and variable across genetic backgrounds. Thus we establish that response to IF is genetically determined in an animal model with physiological features similar to humans. We compared our findings in the CC with those from a parallel study of Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, highlighting common predictors of health and lifespan, as well as key differences between the genetically diverse inbred and outbred models.

Diffusive flow fosters acidic, sulfate-rich conditions that promote kaolinization and pyrite formation. Fatty acid {delta} 13C values down to -39{per thousand} indicate acetyl-CoA-based sulfate reduction as the main metabolism, likely contributing to pyrite formation. In contrast, vigorous venting delivers hot, acidic, carbon-rich, and sulfate-depleted fluids that sustain the activity of sulfide-oxidizing chemoautotrophs. Fatty acid {delta}13C values of up to 4{per thousand} and elemental sulfur accumulation provide evidence of their activity. Without such hydrothermal influence, little microbial activity and only quartz-rich sediments can be observed. Combined multivariate lipid analyses highlight Eh as the strongest environmental control, with increasing average chain length of fatty acids as an adaptation to (hydro-)thermal stress.

Exposing 3D endothelial-fibroblast cocultures to pulsed estim promoted the formation of dense and branched vascular networks. In a microfluidic device model, we show that estim induces the formation of an interconnected vascular network that can be perfused, whereas unstimulated control networks remained less mature. Importantly, we demonstrate that upon implantation, estim-pretreated vascular grafts exhibit elevated anastomosis with host and perfusion with blood relative to the untreated grafts. In addition, we use estim to promote engraftment of a vascularized 3D liver construct. Mechanistically, we find that estim induces membrane hyperpolarization in endothelial cells via voltage-gated potassium (KV) channels. Inhibiting KV channels abrogated estim's pro-vasculogenic effects in endothelial cells. Conversely, pharmacologically activating hyperpolarization induced endothelial responses even without estim, directly linking KVchannel-mediated hyperpolarization as a key mechanism by which estim drives vascular assembly and function.

Unlike fluorescence methods, label-free chemical imaging, mostly based on Raman and infrared spectroscopy, provides intrinsic molecular contrast, enabling the study of biomolecules, nanostructures, drug molecules, and metabolites that cannot be easily tagged. However, while a wide range of fluorescence-based super-resolution techniques are well-established, extending super-resolution to label-free chemical imaging has remained challenging due to low signal levels and limited resolution improvement. Super-resolution stimulated Raman scattering microscopy (SRS) is most promising due to its high sensitivity and imaging speed. Similar to fluorescence, existing SRS super-resolution approaches are mostly based on either photoswitching/saturation of molecular labels or sample expansion, which suffers from poor sensitivity due to limitations in labeling density or signal dilution, respectively. Moreover, axial resolution is typically much worse than lateral resolution, yet most super-resolution SRS techniques focused on improving lateral resolution. In this work, we combine stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) with 4Pi-interferometry to significantly improve the axial resolution by nearly 7-fold. We report on the characterization of improvements in imaging sensitivity and axial resolution using 80 nm polystyrene beads. Harnessing the improved axial resolution, we demonstrate super-resolution 4Pi-SRS imaging in resolving small lipid droplet structures in mammalian cells and lipid membranes in E. coli cells. Because 4Pi-SRS uses interferometry to improve axial resolution, it is completely orthogonal to all previous super-resolution SRS techniques, including visible excitation, photoswitching, sample expansion, and computational approaches, thus it is straightforward to combine them to achieve much higher resolution chemical imaging than currently possible.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

In contrast, fatigued MHC IIA fibers had faster cross-bridge kinetics with increased myofilament and/or cross-bridge viscosity. Single fiber oscillatory work was reduced in both fiber types when Pi or pH alone was altered. However, fatigue conditions returned oscillatory work values toward control through alterations to cross-bridge kinetics in MHC I fibers and changes to work absorption and production processes in MHC IIA fibers. These findings quantify fiber-type specific mechanical and kinetic mechanisms of fatigue in human skeletal muscle at 37{degrees}C, thus advancing our understanding of metabolite-based muscle fatigue in vivo.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

The acute tinnitus population serves as an ideal group for investigating the mechanisms behind the origin and persistence of tinnitus, from its initial onset to its subsequent chronification. One of the neural markers for measuring tinnitus such as neural synchrony or central gain is the Auditory Steady State Response (ASSR). The experiment was carried out on 39 participants with acute tinnitus (18 followed back six months post baseline), 30 with chronic tinnitus, and 27 controls. The results reveal that both cross sectionally and longitudinally, there were no significant differences in absolute amplitudes of ASSR across intensities and the slope of ASSR growth function between the groups. However, Controls tend to have an overall increase in ASSR amplitude when compared to Acute and Chronic Tinnitus which can be attributed to changes in neural synchronisation, attentional modulation, tinnitus-related distress, and diminished GABAergic inhibition coinciding with the presence of tinnitus. As there were no changes in the ASSR amplitude between Acute and Chronic Tinnitus or between Acute and Post Acute Tinnitus despite variations in distress and tinnitus loudness, we infer that auditory sensitivity/neural sensitvity is independent of the tinnitus.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

However the underlying causes of these suppressive temporal interactions remain unclear. A potential explanatory mechanism is temporal normalization, a form of divisive suppression proposed to operate across time in the visual cortex, but largely untested behaviorally. Here in three experiments we tested a key perceptual prediction of temporal normalization: contrast-dependent suppression between sequential stimuli. By independently manipulating the contrasts of two sequential gratings presented 250 ms apart, we found that perceptual sensitivity to a target's orientation decreased when a high- vs. low-contrast non-target appeared either before or after it. Reduced sensitivity arose from both decreased orientation precision and increased \"swapping\" errors. The results provide perceptual support for a temporal normalization computation operating across hundreds of milliseconds, offering a theoretical framework for perceptual limits across time.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Yet, much remains unknown regarding the molecular determinants of biofilms in human pathogens. In this study, we present label-free analysis of biofilms (LFAB), an imaging approach that combines time-lapse, low-magnification brightfield microscopy with regional optical density measurements to quantify biofilm biomass. Unlike other approaches to biofilm biomass quantification, LFAB enables real-time, non-perturbative, and high-throughput monitoring of biofilms. We validated LFAB in diverse microbes and found that our measurements strongly correlate with traditional biofilm assays. We then used LFAB to identify and characterize critical factors mediating biofilm formation in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major human pathogen whose biofilm lifecycle is known to be intimately related to colonization and infection. Initial characterization revealed that S. pneumoniae microcolonies form by radial expansion of attached cells, displaying reproducible morphology and growth dynamics. Screening of a transposon mutant library revealed that genes spanning carbohydrate metabolism, signaling, surface binding, cell wall synthesis, and adhesion impinge on the biofilm lifecycle of S. pneumoniae. We performed follow-up investigations of choline binding protein A (CbpA) and its adjacently encoded two-component system regulator, which we find are critical for the dynamics of microcolony biofilms in S. pneumoniae. Overall, this work establishes LFAB as a powerful approach for identifying and characterizing biofilm determinants across bacteria and uncovers key regulators of the biofilm lifecycle in a major human pathogen.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Here, we integrate metagenomic sequencing with culturing-based recovery of viable microbes to comprehensively characterise FMT preparations from healthy Australian donors. Metagenomic profiling of bacterial communities from repeat FMT faecal donations revealed high temporal stability within individual donors, supporting donor suitability for consistent and standardised FMT production. The community structure and diversity of final FMT products remained largely consistent with their source material, reflecting limited disruption during processing. Culturing and sweep metagenomics showed bacterial species representing 98% of faecal microbiota abundance was recoverable, underscoring the potential of FMTs to deliver a viable and functionally active bacterial community to a recipient. When FMT donor microbiomes were compared to >7,000 healthy gut microbiomes from 27 countries, donor samples were distinct but clustered most closely with other Westernised populations, while also exhibiting significantly higher diversity than most global cohorts. These results highlight the geographic specificity of gut microbiomes and the need to consider population context in donor selection.

K.; Feola, E.; Rouwkema, J.; Sartori, M.", "abstract": "Studying skeletal muscle remodelling across large temporal scales is difficult because most 3D tissue-engineered skeletal muscle (3D-TESM) models cannot sustain stable development over prolonged culture. Skeletal muscle adaptations in vivo are strongly influenced by changes in tissue length, but most TESM models are mechanically restrictive, limiting elongation and thereby constraining structural remodelling. The stiffness of the pillars that anchor the tissues is a key determinant of how much they can shorten or elongate during development, thereby shaping both their morphology and force-generating capacity. To address this limitation, we investigated how TESMs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) develop over two weeks when suspended between pillars with distinct mechanical properties, ranging from mechanically compliant to mechanically stiff boundary conditions. We focused on both passive and active force-generating properties. With compliant pillars, tissues compacted primarily along their length (~66% reduction), followed by progressive elongation (~50% increase) from day 5 onward. In contrast, with stiff pillars, tissues compacted across their width, with no longitudinal shortening. Despite these morphological differences, projected tissue area decreased similarly across setups. Spontaneous contractions emerged from day 7 and continued until day 14, typically occurring in bursts at 0.6-0.8 Hz. Passive force peaked early with compliant pillars and declined thereafter, while remaining relatively stable with stiff pillars. Under stepwise electrical stimulation, maximal contractility was consistently observed at ~50 Hz. Active force rose sharply between day 12 and day 14, with the steepest increase (up to 2000%) in compliant pillars. Although sample size was limited, the consistency of trends across stiffness conditions and surface treatments provides valuable insights into how boundary mechanics shape 3D-TESM development. These findings offer a foundation for designing next-generation muscle culture systems that support dynamic remodelling, force maturation, and training-responsive behaviours.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

However, the nonconvex likelihood of the IG model complicates parameter estimation, requiring careful initialization and adding computational burden. In this work, we introduce a convex alternative: a history-dependent gamma generalized linear model (GLM) for heartbeat dynamics. Applied to a tilt-table dataset, our approach yields accurate and robust heart rate estimation.

The best strategy for acquiring and processing rsfMRI data to mitigate noise remains an open question. In this study of 358 healthy individuals, we compared the denoising efficacy of 60 multi-echo (ME) and 30 single-echo (SE) rsfMRI preprocessing pipelines across six distinct measures of data quality. We also evaluated how each pipeline influences the effect sizes of FC-based predictive models of personality and cognitive measures estimated via cross-validated kernel ridge regression. We found that ME pipelines generally showed superior denoising efficacy to SE pipelines, but that no single pipeline was associated with both superior denoising efficacy and behavioural prediction. Using a heuristic scheme to rank pipelines across benchmark evaluations, we found that an ME acquisition combined with Automatic Removal of Motion Artifacts Independent Component Analysis (ICA-AROMA) and Regressor Interpolation at Progressive Time Delays (RIPTiDe) offered a reasonable compromise between denoising efficacy and brain-behavior predictions for both ME and SE data. In general, ME pipelines ranked more highly than SE pipelines.

While prior research has shown a strong tendency for temporal synchronization between the hands, little is known about how bimanual reaching is organized when each limb is subjected to distinct types of force fields, such as viscous or elastic loads. This study systematically investigated how matched (viscous/viscous, elastic/elastic) and mismatched (e.g., viscous/no load, elastic/no load, viscous/elastic) load conditions influence key timing and kinematic parameters during bimanual reaching tasks across different spatial configurations and force magnitudes. Results show that kinematic measures for each arm, including peak velocity, peak acceleration, and peak deceleration, exhibit significant differences across both matched and mismatched load conditions, reflecting clear adaptations in limb behavior. In contrast, temporal aspects of movement-specifically the timepoints of peak velocity, peak acceleration, peak deceleration, and movement end time-remain coupled under matched loads but become decoupled under mismatched loads, with each limb operating more independently regardless of the spatial configuration of the task. Together, these findings clarify how the motor system balances the need for coordinated bimanual performance with the flexibility required to adapt to varying load conditions. This study extends prior work by demonstrating that not all bimanual reaches are temporally synchronized; instead, task-specific factors such as load type and symmetry critically shape how the limbs coordinate, revealing the motor system's capacity for flexible, context-dependent control.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

Comparative analysis of blood plasma samples from Sam2 knockout and wild-type mice revealed substantial alterations in both proteomic and metabolomic profiles. Proteomic analysis identified 68 differentially expressed proteins (comprising 102 peptides), with notable upregulation of complement component C1qc and downregulation of apolipoprotein A1 (Apoa1), implicating dysregulation of complement cascade pathways. Metabolomic profiling uncovered 15 significantly altered metabolites: nine upregulated species including D-glucuronic acid and 5,10-Methylenetetrahydrofolate, and six downregulated metabolites including folinic acid and acetate. Integrative pathway analysis revealed perturbations in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and glycerophospholipid metabolism, providing mechanistic insights into the molecular consequences of Sam2 deficiency. These findings identify potential biomarkers for anxiety-related disorders and ASD while advancing our understanding of the complex interplay between genetic alterations and proteomic-metabolomic networks in neurodevelopmental conditions.

We analyzed structural connectivity data from 217 fetuses, 448 term infants, and 194 preterm infants as part of the developing Human Connectome Project. We identified a robust, nonlinear U-shaped developmental curve of whole-brain controllability across the perinatal period, with a minimum at approximately 35 gestational weeks. Preterm birth disrupted these trajectories, leading to greater controllability and earlier minimums compared to age-matched fetuses. We used positron emission tomography in seven pregnant rhesus macaques to quantify changes in fetal synaptic density. Increased synaptic density in non-human primates (NHPs) co-occurred with periods of reduced controllability in humans, suggesting that changes in controllability may be driven by synaptogenesis. Finally, using longitudinal scans of a pregnant woman, we mapped the trajectory of changes in maternal controllability during pregnancy. This trajectory exhibited a U-shaped pattern that inversely correlated with the fetal trajectory and reached a maximum around 36 weeks.

Neurons exhibiting frequency tuning were distinct from those displaying phase tuning, and both types of tuning were observed across multiple brain regions with no anatomical preference.

S.; Breedlove, J.; St-Yves, G.; Kay, K.; Naselaris, T.", "abstract": "Extensive work has shown that the visual cortex is reactivated during mental imagery, and that models trained on visual data can predict imagery activity and decode imagined stimuli. These findings may explain why imagery can feel and function like vision, but give little insight into how the brain activity patterns that encode seen and mental images differ. While one popular theory (''weak vision'') suggests that imagery differs from vision only in strength, recent work points to more complex differences. To clarify the relationship between visual and imagery activity in the human brain, we introduce the concept of an imagery transformation - a mapping from visual to imagery activity patterns evoked by the same stimulus. Importantly, this approach can describe a variety of possible scenarios, from simple rescaling to the selective removal or reorientation of activity dimensions. Using two 7T fMRI datasets, we estimated imagery transformations across different visual areas and found they accurately predict imagery activity. We show that imagery transformations are indeed more complex than simple weakening: in early visual cortex, they halve the number of active dimensions and reorient them, such that reconstructions of visual activity in terms of imagery dimensions explain only 25 - 50% of the variance. Nonetheless, these reoriented dimensions still coarsely encode the features encoded by the principal dimensions of visual activity. These findings help to explain the ''same but different'' relationship between mental imagery and vision: imagery activity patterns are transformations of visual activity patterns that approximate them, but encode fewer features and occupy a distinct subspace within the overall space of brain activations.", "date": "2025-09-03", "journal": ""}

However, SNPs form an incomplete set of variation across the genome and since a large percentage of GWAS-significant SNPs lie in non-coding regions, their impact on a given trait is difficult to decipher. Recognizing whether these SNPs are tagging other polymorphisms, like structural variations (SV), is an important step towards understanding the putative causal variation at GWAS loci. Results: Here, we develop GWAS SVatalog (https://svatalog.research.sickkids.ca/), a novel open-source web tool that computes and visualizes linkage disequilibrium (LD) between SVs and GWAS-associated SNPs throughout the human genome. The tool combines GWAS Catalog's SNP-trait association data across 14,479 phenotypes with LD statistics calculated between 35,732 SVs and 116,870 SNPs identified in 101 whole-genome long-read sequences. We use GWAS SVatalog to identify SVs that may explain GWAS loci for iron levels, refractive error, and Alzheimer's disease, where previously SNPs were unable to provide a causal explanation.
