This biomechanical balance is critical for fertilization and relies on the interplay between turgor pressure and cell wall rigidity. How cell wall composition affects its mechanical properties is, however, not well understood. In this study, we combine experimental and simulation techniques to determine key mechanical parameters using Arabidopsis cell wall mutants. We integrated Cellular Force Microscopy with a Finite Element Method-based model to predict growth rates of different mutant pollen tubes. The Finite Element Method-based model allowed us to quantify the effects of cell wall mutations on the time-independent turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity, while cellular force microscopy enabled determination of time-dependent viscoelastic properties of the cell wall. This novel approach can be applied across biological systems and advances mechanical studies of cell and tissue morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

However, causality between limited telomerase expression and brain senescence and neuro-inflammation in the natural ageing setting is yet to be established. Here, we address these questions using the zebrafish as an ageing model which. Akin to humans, zebrafish display premature ageing and death in the absence of telomerase and where telomere shortening is a driver of cellular senescence. Our work shows for the first time that telomerase deficiency (tert-/-) accelerates key hallmarks of ageing identified in the Wild Type (WT) zebrafish brain at transcriptional, cellular, tissue and functional levels. We show that telomerase depletion accelerates ageing-associated transcriptomic changes associated with dysregulation of stress response and immune genes. These are accompanied by accelerated in situ accumulation of senescence-associated markers and inflammation in the aged brain. Importantly, In vivo, these changes correlate with increased blood-brain barrier permeability and increased anxiety-like behaviour. Of note, the acceleration of senescence-associated markers in the absence of tert occurs not only in the expected proliferative areas but also in non-proliferative ones, where it is unlikely due to telomere-dependent replicative exhaustion, suggesting that non-canonical roles of telomerase may be involved. Together, our work suggests that telomerase has a protective role in the zebrafish brain against the accumulation of senescence and neuro-inflammation and is required for blood-brain barrier integrity.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Thus, organ shape must emerge from carefully coordinated growth, especially in leaves that remain relatively flat as they grow. Here we explored the phenotype of the jagged and wavy (jaw-D) mutant in Arabidopsis thaliana, in which the leaves do not remain flat. It has previously been shown that the jaw-D mutant phenotype is caused by the overexpression of miR319, which represses TCP transcription factors, thus delaying maturation of the leaf. We analyzed cell dynamics in wild type and jaw-D by performing time lapse live imaging of developing leaves. We found that the progression of maturation from the tip of the leaf downward was delayed in jaw-D relative to wild type based on several markers of maturation, in agreement with the role of TCP transcription factors in promoting maturation. We further found that these changes in maturation were accompanied by differences in the coordination of growth across the leaf, particularly across the medial-lateral axis, causing growth conflicts that prevent the leaf from remaining flat. Although leaf flatness is often framed as a problem that requires the local synchronization of growth on the abaxial vs adaxial sides of the leaf, our results based on the jaw-D phenotype suggest that wild-type plants also need to coordinate growth more globally across the leaf blade to maintain flatness.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Using calcium (Ca2+) flux as a model, we engineered a Ca2+-dependent luciferase that functions as both a reporter and an activity-gated light source capable of photoactivating light-sensing actuators. In neurons, the presence of luciferin triggers Ca2+ dependent local illumination that provides activity dependent gene expression by activating a light-sensitive transcription factor and control of neural dynamics through opsin activation in single cells, populations and intact tissue. BLADe can be expanded to couple any signal that bioluminescent enzymes can be engineered to detect with the wide variety of photosensing actuators.

W.; Hanscom, R. J.; Higham, T. E.; Sukumaran, J.", "abstract": "This paper introduces a new simulation framework for testing hypotheses relating to behavior strategies in predator-prey systems. To this end, we present two tools for simulating and analyzing behavioral trait dynamics: The Nash Score, a novel metric for evaluating evolutionary stability, and Uumarrty, an agent-based framework for simulating predator-prey interactions using game theory. These tools provide an approach for assessing the temporal co-evolution of behavioral traits within agent-based models, with a particular focus on predator-prey dynamics, though the framework is generalizable to other ecological interactions. The Nash Score functions as an analog to the Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) from classical game theory, offering a quantitative index to assess the relative stability and resilience of behavioral traits under selection. We demonstrate the utility of these tools through a case study on the microhabitat preferences of kangaroo rats and rattlesnakes. Specifically, we explore the emergence and stability of optimal strategies across scenarios with: (1) heterogeneous energy yields among microhabitats, (2) differential strike success rates by microhabitat, and (3) the presence of a specialist predator. Our results highlight how microhabitat specialist predators can drive other predators in the system to specialize due to outcompeting generalists at a given population frequency; leading to behavioral strategy stability in the system. Our case studies also show how behavioral trait dynamics can greatly vary depending on if you treat the trait as a pure strategy versus a mixed strategy. Collectively, this framework enhances our ability to explore ecological and evolutionary responses to environmental change, supporting more robust and comparable simulation-based research in eco-evolutionary dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Behavioral studies suggest that humans are attuned to discrete regularities such as symmetries and parallelism, and rely on their combinations to encode regular geometric shapes in a compressed form. To identify the relevant brain systems and their dynamics, we collected functional MRI in both adults and six-year-olds, and magnetoencephalography data in adults only, during the perception of simple shapes such as hexagons, triangles and quadrilaterals. The results revealed that geometric shapes, relative to other visual categories, induce a hypoactivation of ventral visual areas and an overactivation of the intraparietal and inferior temporal regions also involved in mathematical processing, whose activation is modulated by geometric regularity. While convolutional neural networks captured the early visual activity evoked by geometric shapes, they failed to account for subsequent dorsal parietal and prefrontal signals, which could only be captured by discrete geometric features or by more advanced transformer models of vision. We propose that the perception of abstract geometric regularities engages an additional symbolic mode of visual perception.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Among them are recurrent amplifications of the cell cycle regulatory genes CDK4 and CDK6, which have been clinically implicated in resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the mechanisms by which CDK4/6 upregulation promotes therapy resistance remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that CDK4 or CDK6 overexpression limits EGFR inhibitor-induced proliferative arrest, promoting continued cell cycle progression. This is accompanied by elevated replication stress, increased TPX2 expression, DNA damage leading to ATM activation, and ultimately genomic instability. Integrative transcriptomic and copy number analyses of EGFR-mutant LUAD tumors from both patients and preclinical models revealed that CDK4 or CDK6 amplification is associated with the upregulation of genes linked to tumor progression, including AGR2, ASNS, and STEAP1. CDK4 amplification was also highly correlated with gene expression changes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from patient biopsies. In preclinical models, co-treatment with CDK4/6 and EGFR inhibitors restored proliferative arrest, induced tumor cell apoptosis, and reduced replication stress, DNA damage, and genomic instability. Our findings uncover a mechanistic basis for EGFR inhibitor resistance of CDK4 and CDK6 amplified EGFR-mutant LUAD. They also provide a rationale for the biomarker-driven clinical development of combination EGFR and CDK4/6-targeted therapies for the treatment of a subset of EGFR-mutant LUAD patients.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Among these strains, we identified 131 shared essential or growth-defect-associated genes. Unlike the type strain, the clinical strains showed an increased requirement for genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the type VII secretion system under standard growth conditions, the same genes required for hypoxic pellicle-type biofilm formation in ATCC13950. Consistent with the central role of hypoxia in the evolution of M. intracellulare, the clinical MAC-PD strains showed more rapid adaptation to hypoxic growth than the type strain.

Using our method of video optimization via backpropagation through a state-of-the-art dynamic neural encoding model we reliably reconstruct 10-second movies at 30 Hz from two-photon calcium imaging data. We achieve a pixel-level correction of 0.57 between the ground truth movie and the reconstructions from single-trial neural responses.

Previous studies, mainly focused on North America, provided mixed results. We evaluated the effects of wolf lethal removals on the distribution of attack intensities in the French Alps between 2011 and 2020, using a Before After Control-Impact approach with retrospective data. We built an original framework combining both continuous spatial and temporal scales and a 3D kernel estimation. We compared the attack intensities observed before and after the legal killings of wolves on a period of 90 days and on a range of 10 km, and with control situations where no removal occurred. The analysis was corrected for the presence of livestock. A moderate decrease of attack intensity was the most common outcome after the lethal removal of a single wolf. This reduction was greatly amplified when removing two or three wolves. The scale of analysis also modulated this general pattern, with decreases being generally amplified at a small spatio-temporal range. Contextual factors (e.g., geographical or seasonal variations) could also lead to deviations from this general pattern. Overall, between 2011 and 2020, lethal control of wolves in France generally contributed to reduce livestock attacks, but mainly locally and to a minor extent. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for scale in such assessments and suggest that the evaluation of the effectiveness of lethal removals in reducing livestock predation might be more relevant in a local context. As a next step, we recommend to move forward from patterns to mechanisms by linking the effects of lethal control on wolves to their effects on attacks through analysis of fine-scaled data on wolves and livestock.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

DNAm-based indices predict mortality and provide valuable insights into biological aging mechanisms. Although sex-dependent differences in lifespan are ubiquitous and sex chromosomes are thought to play an important role in sex-specific aging, they have been largely ignored in epigenetic aging studies. We characterized the genome-wide distribution of age-related CpG sites from longitudinal samples in two avian species (zebra finch and jackdaw), including for the first time the avian sex chromosomes (Z and the female-specific, haploid W). In both species, we find a small fraction of the CpG sites to show age-related changes in DNAm with the majority of them being located on the haploid, female-specific W chromosome where DNAm levels predominantly decrease with age. Age-related CpG sites were overrepresented on the zebra finch but underrepresented on the jackdaw Z chromosome. Our results highlight distinct age-related changes in sex chromosome DNAm compared to the rest of the genome in two avian species, suggesting this previously understudied feature of sex chromosomes may be instrumental in sex-dependent aging. Moreover, studying the DNAm of sex chromosomes might be particularly useful in aging research, facilitating the identification of shared (sex-dependent) age-related pathways and processes between phylogenetically diverse organisms.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

To address this, we had thirty young adults perform the gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT), during which their EEG and responses were recorded. States of sustained attention (out- vs. in-the-zone) were identified based on the variance time course of participants RT. Out-of-the-zone states were associated with increased errors of commission and reduced perceptual sensitivity compared to in-the-zone states, as expected. Importantly, a significant decline in theta oscillations at mid-prefrontal regions was found during out-of-the-zone (vs. in-the-zone) states over a ~400 ms period around the transition point between stimuli, and the extent of this decline predicted commission errors and response bias. In addition, individual differences in the variability of midfrontal theta along the task were associated with RT variability. Finally, participants exhibiting greater theta variability showed a more pronounced decline in perceptual sensitivity when being out-of-the-zone and less stable RTs compared to those with lower variability. Our results suggest that states of diminished sustained attention, even during short lapses, are characterized by a reduction in midfrontal theta activity, and that fluctuations in this rhythm covary with fluctuations in attentional control.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Removing reads overlapping these exclusion regions, previously known as Blacklists, help to potentially improve biological signal. Tools like the widely used Blacklist software facilitate this process, but their algorithmic details and parameter choices are not always clearly documented, affecting reproducibility and biological relevance. We examined the Blacklist software and found that pre-generated exclusion sets were difficult to reproduce due to variability in input data, aligner choice, and read length. We also identified and addressed a coding issue that led to over-annotation of high-signal regions. We further explored the use of \"sponge\" sequences - unassembled genomic regions such as satellite DNA, ribosomal DNA, and mitochondrial DNA - as an alternative approach. Aligning reads to a genome that includes sponge sequences reduced signal correlation in ChIP-seq data comparably to Blacklist-derived exclusion sets while preserving biological signal. Sponge-based alignment also had minimal impact on RNA-seq gene counts, suggesting broader applicability beyond chromatin profiling. These results highlight the limitations of fixed exclusion sets and suggest that sponge sequences offer a flexible, alignment-guided strategy for reducing artifacts and improving functional genomics analyses.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

However, identifying the causal function of H3K4me3 in these diverse pathways remains a challenge, and we lack the tools to manipulate it for agricultural benefit. Here we use the CRISPR-based SunTag system to direct H3K4me3 methyltransferases in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Targeting of SunTag-SDG2 activates the expression of the endogenous reporter gene, FWA. We show that SunTag-SDG2 can be employed to increase pathogen resistance by targeting the H3K4me3-dependent disease resistance gene, SNC1. Meiotic crossover recombination rates impose a limit on the speed with which new traits can be transferred to elite crop varieties. We demonstrate that targeting of SunTag-SDG2 to low recombining centromeric regions can significantly stimulate proximal crossover formation. Finally, we reveal that the effect is not specific to SDG2 and is likely dependent on the H3K4me3 mark itself, as the orthogonal mammalian-derived H3K4me3 methyltransferase, PRDM9, produces a similar effect on gene expression with reduced off-target potential. Overall, our study supports an instructive role for H3K4me3 in transcription and meiotic recombination and opens the door to precise modulation of important agricultural traits.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

T.; Chng, S.-S.", "abstract": "Mycolic acids (MAs) are the major component of the mycobacterial outer membrane, a key contributor to the intrinsic resistance of mycobacteria to external insults including multiple antibiotics. After being synthesized in the cytoplasm and before reaching the outer membrane, MAs are transported across the inner membrane in the form of an acylated sugar, generally believed to be trehalose monomycolates (TMMs). Whether trehalose is the only mycolate carrier during transport is under debate, and why this highly abundant disaccharide is essential for mycobacterial growth is unclear. To address these questions, we leveraged a trehalose auxotrophic Mycobacterium smegmatis strain to investigate the biosynthetic steps affording TMMs. We show that in addition to TMMs, MAs are also not produced in the absence of trehalose. This is likely due to a product inhibition mechanism where un-reduced MA precursors accumulate on Pks13, the protein catalyzing the ligation of mycolic acids and the sugar head group. We establish that the un-reduced mycolates could only be released by trehalose, revealing exquisite Pks13 specificity, and subsequently reduced by CmrA in vitro. Furthermore, only trehalose and its analogs can reactivate MA biosynthesis in cells. Finally, by replacing trehalose with a 6-deoxy analog in cells, we demonstrate that the cord factor trehalose dimycolate is dispensable for M. smegmatis growth in vitro. Our work gives a clear depiction of how TMMs are formed and provides a compelling reason for the essentiality of trehalose, shedding light on the development of future anti-mycobacterial strategies.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

These motifs interact with the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains of the KLCs. The mechanism coupling SLiM recognition to activation-associated conformational changes in the complex is unknown. Here we combine protein design, computational modelling, biophysical analysis, and electron microscopy to examine the structural and mechanistic consequences of SLiM binding to the KLC-TPR domain within the complete heterotetrameric holoenzyme. We show that coiled coil 1 (CC1) of the KHC docks KLC TPR domains in the autoinhibited complex, forming the shoulder feature observed in electron microscopy. Disrupting this interaction or binding an activating SLiM dislocates the TPR shoulder, freeing the motor domains and promoting transition between its closed, inactive, and open states. Opening the kinesin-1 complex facilitates binding to the microtubule-associated kinesin-1 cofactor, MAP7. Therefore, cargo-mediated dislocation of the TPR shoulder serves as a key initial step in kinesin-1 activation, allosterically linking cargo binding to motor dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

High sensitivity requires single-cell resolution. Here, we developed an integrated approach combining targeted single-cell DNA sequencing focused on single nucleotide polymorphism (scSNP-DNAseq) with complementary micronuclei and LOH cytometry-reporter assays. This multiplexed strategy enables orthogonal readouts to accurately monitor CRISPR-mediated genotoxicity in primary cells. Using this approach, we detected, mapped and characterized various types of induced-losses of heterozygosity (terminal, interstitial, copy-loss and copy-neutral). Our compelling workflow assessed editing-associated chromosomal instability linked to double strand break after editing.

Conversely, short-term risk was significantly increased with DNA-PKcs inhibitor AZD7648 (HDR booster) in HSPCs and fibroblasts.

This inheritance relies on coordinated apicoplast positioning and fission, but the molecular mechanisms controlling these processes remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized P. falciparum protein (Pf3D7_0613600), which we name PfAnchor, as a key regulator of apicoplast fission. Using Ultrastructure Expansion Microscopy (U-ExM), we show that PfAnchor localizes to the apicoplast throughout the asexual blood-stage. Conditional depletion disrupts apicoplast fission, leading to incomplete cytokinesis and parasite death. Notably, loss of the apicoplast's elongated branched structure via azithromycin treatment rescues these defects, underscoring Anchor's specific role in apicoplast fission. Immunoprecipitation identified an interaction with the dynamin-like GTPase PfDyn2, a key mediator of both apicoplast and mitochondrial fission, establishing PfAnchor as the first apicoplast-specific dynamin adaptor protein.

Although prior research has examined the psychological and neural correlates of these emotions, the cognitive antecedents that trigger them, as well as their transformation into social behavior, remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we developed a novel task to investigate how two crucial cognitive antecedents, harm and responsibility, elicit guilt and shame, and how these emotions subsequently drive compensatory behavior, by combining functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with computational modeling. Behaviorally, we found that harm had a stronger impact on guilt than on shame, whereas responsibility had a stronger impact on shame than guilt, which supports the functionalist theory of emotion. Moreover, compared to shame, guilt exerted a greater effect on compensation. Computational modeling results indicated that the integration of harm and responsibility by individuals is consistent with the phenomenon of responsibility diffusion. The fMRI results revealed that brain regions associated with inequity representation (posterior insula) and value computation (striatum) encode this integrated measure. Furthermore, individual differences in responsibility-driven shame sensitivity were associated with activity in theory-of-mind regions (temporoparietal junction and superior temporal sulcus). Guilt- and shame-driven compensatory behavior recruited distinct neural substrates, with shame-driven compensatory sensitivity being more strongly linked to activity in the lateral prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in cognitive control.

Dynein activation requires the multi-subunit dynactin complex and an activating cargo adaptor. The adaptors serve to link dynein with cargo and to fully activate the motor. Mutations in one of these activating adaptors, Bicaudal-D2 (BICD2), are associated with a neurodegenerative disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy with Lower Extremity Predominance (SMALED2). The molecular defect that underlies SMALED2 is largely unknown. In addition to interacting with dynein, BICD2 has also been shown to associate with KIF5B, a plus-end directed microtubule motor. We hypothesized that interactome changes associated with mutant versions of BICD2, and the resulting differences in cargo transport, might underlie the etiology of SMALED2. To test our hypothesis, we first defined the interactome of wild-type BICD2. This led to the identification of known BICD2 interacting proteins in addition to potentially novel cargo such as components of the HOPS complex, a six-subunit complex involved in endo-lysosomal trafficking. We next determined the interactome of three SMALED2 linked mutants in BICD2, two of which reside in the cargo binding domain. Interestingly, all three mutations resulted in BICD2-mediated dynein hyper-activation. Furthermore, all three mutants were associated with interactome changes. One of these mutants, BICD2_R747C, was deficient in binding to HOPS complex components and the nucleoporin RANBP2. In addition, this mutant also resulted in a gain of function interaction with GRAMD1A, a protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum.

However, isoprene synthase is unknown in the entire Fagaceae family. Notably, even within a single genus such as Quercus, both isoprene-emitting and non-emitting species are present, yet the molecular basis of this dichotomy remains unclear. Here, we report the identification of the IspS gene from the isoprene-emitting species Quercus serrata (QsIspS1) through seasonal transcriptome analysis and its detailed biochemical characterization. We also identified two genes with high sequence similarity to QsIspS1 in the genomes of non-emitting species: Q. glauca (QgIspS1-like) and Lethocarpus edulis (LeIspS1-like). We discovered mutations in these sequences that likely impair their function. Biochemical analysis revealed that QgIspS1-like is a monoterpene synthase, whereas LeIspS1-like is a pseudogene incapable of isoprene synthesis, explaining these plants' inability to emit isoprene.

Epistasis shapes this evolution, as an antigenic mutation that is deleterious in one genetic background may become tolerated in another.

Here, we measure how all amino acid mutations in the HA of a recent human H3N2 influenza strain affect its cell entry function, acid stability, and neutralization by human serum antibodies. We find that epistasis has entrenched certain mutations so that reverting to the ancestral amino acid identity in earlier strains is no longer tolerated. Epistasis has also enabled the emergence of antigenic mutations that were detrimental to HA's cell entry function in earlier strains. However, epistasis appears insufficient to overcome the pleiotropic costs of antigenic mutations that impair HA's stability, explaining why some mutations that strongly escape human antibodies never fix in nature.

Our fBOS model is a polygon that contains centre-of-pressure trajectories recorded as standing participants move their bodies in the largest possible loop while keeping their feet flat on the ground. Here we assess how the size of the fBOS changes with age by comparing 38 younger (YA), 14 middle-aged (MA), and 34 older adults (OA). The fBOS area is smaller in older adults: OA area is 58% of the YA area (p<0.001), and 59% of the MA area (p=0.001), with no difference between YA and MA. The reduction in fBOS area among the OA is primarily caused by a reduction in the length of the fBOS. In addition, among older adults smaller fBOS areas correlated with a lower score on the Short Physical Performance Battery (=0.28, p=0.04), a reduced walking speed (=0.25, p=0.04), and a higher frailty level (p=0.09). So that others can extend our work, we have made our fBOS models available online.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Aim: We aim to evaluate and compare methods of SC regression as implemented in the most widely used fNIRS analysis toolboxes, with the goal of reaching a consensus on best practices for incorporating SC into generalized linear model (GLM)-based analyses. Specifically, we compared eight SC regression strategies addressing anatomical specificity, dimensionality reduction strategies, and SC availability. Approach: 16 healthy adults passively listened and watched ecological auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli while occipital and bilateral auditory cortices were recorded. Results: Oxygenated hemoglobin signals (HbO) processed without SC regression produced uninterpretable results. SC regression methods that pooled all available SC signals without spatial constraints consistently outperformed anatomically restricted approaches. Orthogonalization further enhanced performance by reducing redundancy and capturing shared systemic variance, improving detection of stimulus-specific cortical responses and contrast sensitivity. Deoxygenated hemoglobin signals (HbR), while less sensitive to systemic artifacts than HbO, benefited most, similarly to HbO, from the pooled, orthogonalized SC signal approach. Conclusion: Overall, our findings highlight the essential role of SC regression in recovering physiologically meaningful signals in fNIRS and recommend including all available SC channels within the GLM, coupled with orthogonalization techniques, as a generalizable best practice for denoising across diverse experimental designs and hardware configurations.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Experimental determination of all possible mutation effects is infeasible, and while state-of-the-art tools such as AlphaMissense show promise, their diagnostic performance is insufficient and they are often difficult to run locally. We developed pLM-SAV, a simple yet effective predictor that leverages protein language models (pLMs). {Delta}-embeddings, computed as the difference between wild-type and mutant sequence embeddings, are used as input for a convolutional neural network. To prevent data leakage, we trained our model on a well-characterized, labeled set of Eff10k and evaluated it on a non-homologous subset of ClinVar data. Our results demonstrate that this approach performs exceptionally well on the Eff10k test folds and reasonably on ClinVar test sets. Notably, pLM-SAV excels in resolving ambiguous predictions by AlphaMissense. We also found that an ensemble method, REVEL, outperforms both AlphaMissense and pLM-SAV, thus, we integrated these REVEL-enhanced predictions into our widely used AlphaMissense web application. Our results demonstrate that an SAV predictor trained on labeled data can achieve high predictive performance. Unlike previous methods such as VESPA, pLM-SAV uses no handcrafted features or substitution matrices, relying solely on pLM-derived representations. We anticipate that incorporating delta-embeddings into other mutation effect predictors or mutant structure prediction methods will further enhance their accuracy and utility in diverse biological contexts.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables comprehensive profiling of millions of cells in aged tissues, reliably identifying senescent cells remains challenging due to the weak and non-specific expression of their marker genes. Existing computational methods can detect active cell states through gene set scoring, but their performance for senescence genes has not been rigorously evaluated. Results: In this study, we show that senescence genes display weak, non-specific expression patterns across different tissues and are susceptible to dropout events in scRNA-seq. Current scoring approaches suffer intrinsic limitations in single-cell detection using weakly expressed markers. Simply expanding the gene set of weak markers failed to improve detection accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we developed ICE (Imputation-based Cell Enrichment), a computational framework that combines expression imputation with iterative marker refinement. ICE substantially improved detection precision in pancreatic  cells with weakly expressed markers, increasing it from 56% to 98%. Using consensus markers, ICE identified senescent fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) in muscle tissue, characterized by elevated expression of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) genes. When applied to individual senescence markers (CDKN1A/p21, CDKN2A/p16, ATF3, and MX1), ICE successfully identified marker-specific cell populations. These included stressed {beta} cells in aging and type-I interferon-responsive microglia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Conclusions: Our study introduces ICE, a rigorous framework for detecting cell states defined by weakly expressed markers at the single-cell level.

Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging technique that captures brain activity at high temporal resolution. However, its spatial resolution is insufficient to accurately localize neural activation, and thus cannot capture the interactive nature of human brain activity. To resolve this issue, various MEG source estimation models have been proposed. In particular, models incorporating prior information from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which offers superior spatial resolution, have improved source estimation accuracy. However, these models typically ignore the similarity of activity across different brain areas, and still fall short in tracking dynamic brain activity pattern at a sufficient spatial scale. In this study, we developed a block-structured model that integrates information about functional areas and the inter-areal relationships of the human brain into MEG source estimation based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We evaluated our model performance using simulation data with sequential activation across multiple brain areas. Results showed that our model outperformed conventional approaches in source estimation accuracy, suggesting that incorporating the functional areal information and inter-areal relationships may enhance MEG source estimation, enabling human neuroimaging at high spatio-temporal resolution.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

We previously demonstrated that paediatric iDCM serum-circulating proteins promote pathologic remodeling in vitro, and that secreted frizzled related protein 1 (sFRP1) increases stiffness in cardiomyocytes. Here we investigated the mechanisms by which sFRP1 contributes to iDCM. Methods: The effect of sFRP1 in combination with isoproterenol (ISO) (to recapitulate the increase in circulating catecholamine observed in paediatric iDCM) was evaluated in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (in vitro), and in neonatal rats through intraperitoneal injections (in vivo). Function and molecular mechanisms were investigated through echocardiography and next-generation-sequencing. Protein levels and localization were determined by Western blot. Tissue stiffness was measured by Atomic Force Microscopy. In vitro and in vivo data were compared to explanted human heart tissue. Results: We show that ISO+sFRP1 reactivates the fetal gene program in vitro, and promotes cardiac dysfunction, dilation and stiffness in vivo. Importantly, we show stiffness is also increased in paediatric iDCM hearts. We identified co-activation of Notch and WNT signaling in both ISO+sFRP1-treated rats and paediatric iDCM hearts. Mechanistically, in vitro inhibition of Notch or {beta}-catenin prevented pathological remodeling, and Notch inhibition improved cardiac function, myocardial stiffness and ventricular dilation in ISO+sFRP1-treated rats.

Through systematic screens of fatty acyl transferase enzymes (MBOAT and zDHHC families) and complementary approaches including CRISPR/Cas9 gene deletions, pharmacological inhibition, proteomics, and photo-crosslinkable cholesterol analogues, we identified cholesteryl ester-enriched lipid droplets (CE-LDs) as critical host components required for flavivirus infection. CE-LD formation is mediated by Sterol O-acyltransferases 1 and 2 (SOAT1/SOAT2), whose activities were upregulated early during infection, coinciding with increased CE-LD formation and transition to liquid crystalline phases. Genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of either enzyme resulted in a dramatic ~100-fold reduction in viral production. Mechanistically, CE-LDs display distinct proteomic signatures, enriched in fatty acid remodelling enzymes, GTPases, and lipid transport proteins. Photo-crosslinking experiments demonstrated direct interactions between LD-derived cholesterol and viral prM, capsid and NS1. Disrupting CE-LD formation via SOAT1/2-deficiency resulted in defective, viral RNA-free replication organelles and complete absence of immature virions. Supporting the physiological and clinical relevance of viral LD exploitation, analysis in iPSC-derived macrophages mirrored findings in Huh7 cells, and dengue patients from a Sri Lankan cohort revealed that central obesity significantly increased the risk of severe dengue haemorrhagic fever.

One major limitation of most conventional flow cytometry analyses is the dependency on a mostly manual gating process. This generally involves sequentially selecting biomarkers to isolate phenotype-associated cell populations, an approach that is both labor-intensive and prone to bias. To address this challenge, we introduce the application of a series of multi-instance learning frameworks for automated flow cytometry data analysis. Our models demonstrate strong performance across diverse biomedical applications, including cancer subtyping based on tumor-infiltrating immune cells, HIV survival stratification, AML minimal residual disease prediction, and COVID-19 severity assessment. We further examine how network architecture affects predictive performance and the detection of rare but clinically significant cell populations. Notably, our models utilize attention mechanisms to directly identify phenotype-associated cell subsets, serving as an interpretable, data-driven alternative to fully manual gating. These findings underscore the potential of multi-instance learning as a scalable and interpretable framework for flow cytometry, with broad applications in precision medicine and translational immunology.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Spa2, a multi-domain protein and member of the polarisome, orchestrates tip growth in yeast and other fungi. We identified a conserved short linear motif in the RabGAPs Msb3 and Msb4, and the MAP kinase kinase Ste7 and Mkk1, which mediates their interaction with Spa2. AlphaFold predictions suggest that these initially unstructured motifs adopt an alpha-helical conformation upon binding to the hydrophobic cleft of Spa2s N-terminal domain. Altering the predicted key contact residues in either Spa2 or the motif reduces complex stability. Such mutations also cause mis-localization of Msb3, Msb4, and Ste7 within the cell. Deleting the motif in Msb3 or Msb4 abolishes tip-directed growth of the yeast bud. Protein assemblies that spatially confine secretion to specific membrane regions are a common feature of eukaryotic cells.

A key feature of this process is the visual perspective adopted during remembering, which shapes subjective memory experience. Using fMRI, we cued participants to retrieve AMs from an own-eyes, observer, or natural perspective followed by an event probe. Our design dissociates preparatory (cue phase) and reconstructive (probe phase) mechanisms to isolate the neural signatures of retrieval orientation, the strategic use of cues to optimize retrieval. Whole-brain and ROI analyses revealed that the angular gyrus (AG) and precuneus support perspective-guided retrieval in distinct ways. During the cue phase, PGp showed greater activity for instructed perspectives than natural retrieval, consistent with preparatory perspective selection. During the probe phase, observer-perspective retrieval elicited greater activity in PGp and precuneus (7P), supporting sustained perspective maintenance. Brain-behavior models linked PGp and 7P activity to greater vividness and perspective stability, while precuneus (7M) activity was negatively associated with emotional intensity, especially in the observer condition. These findings reveal phase- and subregion-specific contributions of posterior parietal cortex to the subjective qualities of memory.

Here, we developed Spl-ISO-Seq2 (220nm spot size and 500nm resolution), and the accompanying software packages Spl-IsoQuant-2 and Spl-IsoFind, enabling long-read sequencing using 140 million barcodes compared to 80,000 previously. Applying this to the adult mouse brain, we compared spatial variability by examining (a) differential isoform abundance between known brain regions and (b) spatial isoform patterns that do not align with predefined regions. While the former revealed more spatial isoform differences, both approaches identified overlapping hits, e.g., Rps24 in oligodendrocytes. For Snap25, previously known to exhibit spatial isoform variation, we now show that this variability occurs in excitatory neurons. The second approach also uncovered patterns not captured by predefined-region comparisons, e.g., Tnnc1 in excitatory neurons. Furthermore, we show that a surprising number of spatial isoform signals is not driven by cell-type composition alone.

These medically important protists lack conventional transcriptional control due to their unusual genome organization. Consequently, tRNA modifications may provide an additional mechanism for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. One such modification is queuosine (Q), which is incorporated at anticodon wobble position 34 of specific tRNAs. Here, we demonstrate that Q-tRNA levels increase substantially during Leishmania differentiation from the insect stage to the mammalian-infective stage. Mutant cells lacking the enzyme responsible for Q incorporation, tRNA-guanine transglycosylase (TGT), exhibit substantial changes in the proteome during differentiation in vitro. Specifically, downregulated proteins were enriched in NAU codons, whereas upregulated proteins predominantly contained NAC codons. We further evaluated the effect of Q-tRNA depletion on macrophage infections and using mouse model. Although LmxTGT2 knockout parasites exhibited normal growth and differentiation in vitro, they demonstrated impaired survival within macrophages and reduced pathogenicity in mice. Taken together, these results highlight the critical role of Q-tRNA modification in maintaining translational balance and reveal a novel level of gene expression regulation facilitating parasite adaptation to changing environments and contributing to Leishmania virulence.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Our structure-activity analysis revealed that introducing a rigid azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium group boosted binding affinity (up to 250-fold compared to parental compounds) yet reduced the half-life of functional antagonism. In contrast, analogues with moderate flexibility maintained high potency while preserving longer receptor residence time. Computational docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations demonstrated that stable hydrogen bonding with residue N6.52 and salt-bridge formation with D3.32 were critical for sustained ligand binding to the receptor, with MD-derived metrics outperforming docking energies in predicting biological activity.

Specifically, the nonlinear circuit dynamics can implement natural gradient Langevin and Hamiltonian sampling of uni- and multi-variate stimulus posteriors, and these algorithms can be switched by interneurons. We also find that the non-equilibrium circuit dynamics when transitioning from the resting to evoked state can further accelerate natural gradient sampling, and analytically identify the neural circuit's annealing strategy.

V.; Chatterjee, N.; Krishnamurthy, R.", "abstract": "Background: Free-ranging dogs are widely considered to have negative impacts on wildlife in shared landscapes. Understanding their use of these landscapes is therefore essential to develop effective management strategies in wildlife-adjacent regions. In this study, we investigated the movement patterns of free-ranging dogs in the protected area matrix of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in Southern India. Methods: Fifteen owned free-ranging dogs (FRD) were collared from two adjacent villages with different levels of human habitation. We hypothesized that increased settlement cover would provide dogs with a greater human shield effect, allowing them more freedom of movement. We estimated dog activity ranges and movement patterns using autocorrelated kernel density estimates (AKDE). Large-scale movement was characterized through multiple metrics (intensity of space use and mean distance from home) and compared across villages to understand underlying drivers. Lastly, we quantified fine-scale movement and habitat selection using integrated step selection analysis (iSSA). Results: We found that FRD in MTR had directionally dependent home-ranging behavior and small activity ranges, with the mean AKDE activity range being 9.88 +/- 7.69 ha (median = 6.09 ha, range 3.28-26.16 ha), and primarily utilized the area within 500 m of their homes. None of the movement metrics varied significantly between villages, except for intensity of use, which was higher in one village than the other, suggesting that dogs in the less populated village perceived a greater threat from surrounding wildlife and were more driven to seek refuge inside their activity ranges. iSSA revealed that dogs selected strongly for human settled or human-modified habitats, and moved significantly faster in forest land than any other habitat. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that owned FRD pose a relatively lower threat to wildlife in MTR than feral dogs may. They also support the human shield hypothesis, show that FRD display behavioral plasticity at fine scales of <5km, and highlight the role of human land use intensity in shaping the movement of domestic dogs. As humans can thus mediate potential effects of dogs on wildlife, anthropogenic factors should be taken in consideration when designing management strategies that aim to curb dog movement.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Using recurrent spiking network simulations, we show that firing rate encodes stimulus class while spike synchrony encodes stimulus familiarity. This division of labor becomes critical when saliency varies: firing rate alone cannot reliably distinguish between novel high-saliency stimuli and familiar low-saliency stimuli, whereas spike synchrony reliably differentiates these cases. We validate this complementary coding scheme across two network architectures - a biologically realistic V1 model and an abstract associative memory network - demonstrating robustness across connectivity regimes and memory loads. When inputs possess temporal structure, spike synchrony alone can encode both stimulus identity and familiarity, suggesting an efficient processing mode for familiar stimuli.

F.; Beauchamp, M. S.", "abstract": "In the McGurk effect, incongruent auditory and visual syllables are perceived as a third, illusory syllable. The prevailing explanation for the effect is that the illusory syllable is a consensus percept intermediate between otherwise incompatible auditory and visual representations. To test this idea, we turned to a deep neural network known as AVHuBERT that transcribes audiovisual speech with high accuracy. Critically, AVHuBERT was trained only with congruent audiovisual speech, without exposure to McGurk stimuli or other incongruent speech. In the current study, when tested with congruent audiovisual \"ba\", \"ga\" and \"da\" syllables recorded from 8 different talkers, AVHuBERT transcribed them with near-perfect accuracy, and showed a human-like pattern of highest accuracy for audiovisual speech, slightly lower accuracy for auditory-only speech, and low accuracy for visual-only speech. When presented with incongruent McGurk syllables (auditory \"ba\" paired with visual \"ga\"), AVHuBERT reported the McGurk fusion percept of \"da\" at a rate of 25%, many-fold greater than the rate for either auditory or visual components of the McGurk stimulus presented on their own. To examine the individual variability that is hallmark of human perception of the McGurk effect, 100 variants of AVHuBERT were constructed. Like human observers, AVHuBERT variants was consistently accurate for congruent syllables but highly variable for McGurk syllables. Similarities between the responses of AVHuBERT and humans to congruent and incongruent audiovisual speech, including the McGurk effect, suggests that DNNs may be a useful tool for interrogating the perceptual and neural mechanisms of human audiovisual speech perception.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

However, whether intracellular ion concentration changes directly regulate signaling molecules, independent of these conventional pathways, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that even in the absence of cellular membranes, an increase in Na+ or K+ concentration rapidly reduces activation-loop phosphorylation of multiple AGC kinases, including PKN, PKC{zeta}/{lambda}, and p70 S6 kinase. When ion concentrations were reduced, the activation-loop phosphorylation, which had initially decreased, recovered within a short period. Notably, this recovery occurred in the absence of PDK1, a known kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of these activation loops, and did not require ATP or Mg2+ in lysate assays. 32P tracing experiments revealed a novel 'reacquisition of phosphate group' mechanism, in which phosphate groups transiently dissociate from the activation loops under high Na+ or K+ conditions and are subsequently re-incorporated into the activation loops when ion concentrations are reduced. These findings indicate that elevated Na+ or K+ concentrations directly and rapidly reduce the activity of multiple AGC kinases, and that the activity rapidly recovers upon reduction in ion concentrations, through an unconventional phosphate transfer mechanism distinct from canonical protein phosphorylation reactions. Our study suggests the existence of a robust phosphorylation homeostasis mechanism independent of conventional kinase-phosphatase systems, providing new insights into signaling pathways regulated by intracellular Na+/K+ ion dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

The standard treatment of amphotericin B (AmB) induction followed by itraconazole consolidation still results in 15% to 30% mortality. This study aimed to investigate the potential of AmB and flucytosine (5FC) combination therapy to enhance antifungal activity.\n\nMethodsThe in vitro antifungal activity of AmB and 5FC alone and in combination against 60 T. marneffei clinical isolates was evaluated using a validated colorimetric antifungal susceptibility assay and the checkerboard method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was defined as the lowest drug concentration inhibiting [&ge;] 95% fungal growth (MIC95) for both AmB and 5FC. The combination effect between AmB and 5FC against T. marneffei was determined using fractional inhibitory concentration index. Combination effects were further tested using a time-kill assay.\n\nResultsThe MIC95 was 0.25 - 2 g/mL (geometric mean [GM] 0.68 g/mL) for AmB, and 0.03 - 0.5 g/mL (GM 0.28 g/mL) for 5FC. Full synergy was observed in 4 isolates (7%), and indifference was observed in the remaining 56 isolates (93%). The time-kill experiments revealed a concentration-dependent fungicidal activity of AmB, and concentration-independent fungistatic effect of 5FC.

Cell-free expression systems (CFES) are uniquely suited to address this challenge, as they can integrate measurements ideal for either in vitro or in cyto settings. Further, because CFES are open systems, they enable a level of control over component concentration unattainable in cells. Here, we use cell-free systems to characterize genetically encoded RNA circuits that operate via toehold-mediated strand exchange (TMSE). These circuits have been extensively characterized in vitro and were recently deployed as translational riboregulators in E. coli, revealing key differences between the two environments. By systematically modulating the design parameters of these RNA circuits in both purified protein and lysate-based CFES, we elucidate the mechanisms linking TMSE to protein expression. Further, we combine measurements and alterations in CFES composition that are infeasible in cells to investigate interactions between cellular components and RNA circuit components, identifying a potential interaction with ribosomes that informs circuit design. Our results establish a unified set of principles for designing and operating genetically encoded TMSE circuits across in vitro, CFE, and bacterial environments, which should catalyze the widespread adoption of this platform for new applications in molecular programming, synthetic biology, and biotechnology.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

However, how YAP/TAZ stiffness sensitivity and signaling activity contribute to aberrant HHT angiogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we extended our previous computational framework of stiffness-mediated YAP/TAZ-VEGF-NOTCH crosstalk to account for ALK1 signalling and predict the resulting angiogenic temporal dynamics. Our simulations predicted that ALK1 knockout impairs NOTCH activation, slowing endothelial phenotypic selection and shuffling while enhancing filopodia activity, features corresponding with hypersprouting. These effects were most pronounced in low stiffness environments, consistent with the previously observed prevalence of HHT vascular malformations in low stiffness organs. Importantly, the temporal dynamics of endothelial phenotypic selection and shuffling, as well as key protein activity levels, were partially restored by direct or cytoskeleton-mediated inhibition of YAP/TAZ resulting from increased NOTCH activation. These computational findings offer more mechanistic insight into the signalling pathways and temporal dynamics of endothelial phenotypic selection underlying HHT vascular anomalies, and suggest that targeting YAP/TAZ and endothelial stiffness sensitivity may offer a promising therapeutic strategy to restore physiological angiogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

L.; Chhabra, A.; Ozmeral, E. J.; Lertpoompunya, A.; Eddins, D. A.; Higgins, N. C.", "abstract": "Head movements play a pivotal role while engaged in multi-talker conversation by providing non-verbal feedback to partners and enhancing a listeners ability to separate sound sources. Commercial hearing-aids with an on-board IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit, i.e., accelerometers) typically use that information for step-counting and activity levels. At least one device uses it as an input to their environment classifier and integrated directional microphone. None, however, use the IMU to detect specific patterns of head movements to predict behaviors such as nodding, head shaking, listening to a person versus a video, or talking. Training an automatic classifier to accurately detect these behaviors first requires collecting head movement data during multi-person conversation and laboriously annotating each behavior-type for each participant with high temporal precision. From that point, with the goal of training the most accurate model and integrating with the hardware in the hearing aid to improve device performance, the question is how best to model the data. To address this gap, we collected accelerometer data during natural multi-person conversations and paired it with detailed human annotations of communication and head-movement behaviors. Head-movement data was collected from three cohorts of young, normal-hearing individuals (three per cohort) in a controlled, conference-room setting during 50-minute multi-talker conversations. Participants wore hearing aids with on-board accelerometers, and audio-video was recorded for each talker. Videos were manually annotated for communication and head-movement behaviors, including conversational turns and nonverbal cues such as tilts and nods. Temporal and spectral features were extracted from the accelerometer data (windowed into 1-second segments) corresponding to roll and pitch movements. These features, combined with the annotated behaviors, were used to train and test machine learning models. Models were trained on data from all but one participant and then tested on the held-out participant, repeating this procedure across all individuals. Several deep learning and classical machine learning models were compared for classifying communication behaviors (e.g., talking, listening, watching video) and head orientations (e.g., turning left or right, facing down, facing forward). More specifically, various sequence-to-sequence models, a state-of-the-art deep learning technique, were utilized. These models incorporated modern architectural components such as transformer networks. Multiple performance metrics were used to evaluate models, and results suggest that modern deep learning models outperform classical machine learning methods by significant margins. Classification performance improved further when temporal sequence information was incorporated. These results indicate that during multi-talker conversation, hearing-aid accelerometers can automatically classify stereotypical behaviors with high temporal resolution (1-second). Even when tested on unseen subjects, the models remained reliable. This establishes a foundation for more advanced approaches that combine behavioral and movement patterns, further integrate temporal dynamics, and incorporate additional inputs to improve accuracy and ecological validity.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used an edge-centric approach to examine cross-sectional differences in functional brain network organization across the human lifespan using resting state functional MRI data from the Nathan Kline Institute - Rockland Sample dataset. By creating edge time series - a framewise multiplication of nodal time series - and clustering them based on their temporal similarities, we were able to identify clusters of edges instead of nodes. This method naturally allows multiple community affiliations per node (brain region), providing a nuanced perspective on network participation compared to conventional hard-partition approaches. To do so, we created age-neutral templates of edge communities - or \"eFC lures\" - that, when applied, yielded consistent edge communities across non-overlapping subsamples of data. The communities of edges revealed a trajectory of desegregation with aging, suggested to be linked to neural dedifferentiation of activity and cognitive decline in older adults. Additionally, age group-specific lures significantly enhanced the detection of edge community organization compared to the age-neutral version. Combined, these results offer new insights into the heterogeneous, event cluster-level shifts in brain functional organization as well as underscore the importance of age-targeted analytical frameworks throughout the human lifespan.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Although studies of white matter asymmetry have been previously documented, they have often been constrained by limited age ranges, sample sizes, or the scope of the tracts and structural features examined. While normative lifespan charts for brain structures are emerging, comprehensive charts detailing white matter asymmetries across numerous pathways and diverse structural measures have been notably absent. This study addresses this gap by leveraging a large-scale dataset of 26,199 typically developing and aging individuals, ranging from 0 to 100 years of age, from 42 primary neuroimaging studies. We generated comprehensive lifespan trajectories for 30 lateralized association and projection white matter tracts, examining 14 distinct microstructural and macrostructural features of these pathways. Our findings reveal that: (1) asymmetries are widespread across the brain's white matter and are present in all 30 pathways; (2) for a given pathway, the degree and direction of asymmetry differ between features of tissue microstructure and pathway macrostructure; (3) asymmetries vary across and within pathway types (association and projection tracts); and (4) these asymmetries are not static, following unique trajectories across the lifespan, with distinct changes during development, and a general trend of becoming more asymmetric with increasing age (particularly in later adulthood) across pathways. This study represents the most extensive characterization of white matter asymmetry across the lifespan to date, charting how lateralization patterns emerge, mature, and change throughout life. It provides a foundational resource for understanding the principles of white matter organization from early to late life, its relation to functional specialization and inter-individual variability, and offers a key reference for interpreting deviations during healthy development and aging as well as those associated with clinical populations.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a unifying theoretical framework, most empirical studies of animal learning behavior have focused on non-stationary environments (e.g. changing reward probabilities in a known task), as opposed to acquiring an entirely new task from scratch. Here we introduce a statistical framework to infer reinforcement learning rules directly from single-animal behavior. Applied to mice learning a perceptual decision-making task, our approach reveals that policy-gradient-like rules capture de novo task learning better than classical temporal-difference algorithms. By fitting flexible parametric learning rules, we uncover systematic deviations from standard RL models, including side-specific learning rates and negative reward baselines. Together, these parameters account for side-biased learning, as well as forgetting and consecutive errors due to aversive responses to incorrect trials. Extending the framework with latent, dynamic learning rates further reveals that animals adapt their learning rates over training and across curricula.

We investigated how the structure of working-memory representations in the cortex compares to task representations that do not involve working memory. We used a task-switching paradigm in virtual reality, where mice alternated between a navigation-based working-memory task and a simpler task with matched sensorimotor demands. During behavior, we simultaneously imaged three cortical areas: higher visual area AM, and two association areas-premotor (M2) and retrosplenial cortex. At the single-neuron level, trial-averaged activity appeared similar across tasks. However, pairwise correlations decreased during the working-memory task, particularly in association areas. In addition, the corresponding linear task subspace explained the variance of both tasks equally well, whereas the simpler task subspace failed to do so, suggesting an asymmetric relationship between them. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction revealed a shared low-dimensional structure across tasks. Yet, the organization of neuronal firing fields along this shared structure accounted for the difference in pairwise correlations: in the working-memory task, firing fields were more disjoint, especially among neurons in association areas that formed sequences along the memory dimension. Moreover, the degree of overlap between these firing fields predicted the mice's behavioral reliance on working memory. We conclude that behaviors varying in cognitive demands are supported by a single low-dimensional neural structure, which can expand or contract depending on cognitive load.

Although overall burst features were similar across groups in the spectral domain, children with DCD showed disrupted rate modulation of specific burst waveform motifs, characterized by atypical lateralization and altered interhemispheric connectivity. These disruptions were strongest for a subset of burst types identified by principal component analysis, and individual differences in motif-specific burst rates correlated with motor ability.

Here, we generated a large-scale, single-cell multi-omic atlas - integrating DNA methylation and 3D genome architecture - from postmortem brain tissue of matched AD patients and cognitively normal controls. Samples were collected from three brain regions with distinct vulnerability to AD pathology: the temporal cortex (TC), primary visual cortex (VC), and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Our dataset comprises over 230,000 individual cells, spanning major neuronal and glial populations, and provides a high-resolution view of multi-layer epigenomic regulation. We identified widespread AD-associated DNA methylation changes and marked reorganization of 3D genome structure, including alterations in A/B compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and chromatin loops. These changes are strongly region-specific: TC displays pronounced hypermethylation, transcriptional downregulation, and elevated boundary density, whereas VC shows opposing trends and PFC an intermediate profile. We further uncovered previously unrecognized AD-associated glial and neuronal states defined by coordinated epigenomic dysregulation and recurrent genomic deletions, particularly near telomeric regions. This region-resolved, single-cell multi-omic atlas reveals divergent epigenomic trajectories across brain regions and cell types in AD, offering new mechanistic insights and a framework for targeted therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

However, it is largely unknown how somatic mutation rates and patterns vary among the brain's diverse types of neurons. Characterizing this variability is critical for elucidating the role of genome integrity in human brain function and disease. Moreover, the significant physiological differences among the brain's cell types provides an opportunity to learn more general underlying factors that determine mutation rates and patterns. Here, we utilized high-fidelity duplex DNA sequencing to profile somatic mutation processes across the lifespan in the two major cell types of the human cerebellum, Purkinje neurons and granule neurons, which have dramatically different sizes, functions, and physiologies. Surprisingly, these cell types exhibited similar rates of substitution mutations, including similar rates of signature SBS5 that is responsible for most mutations in the body yet whose mechanism remains unknown. However, we identified differences in Purkinje and granule neurons' patterns of substitutions and in their rates and patterns of insertions and deletions, with transcription playing a key role in mediating these differences. Our work indicates that different types of neurons in the brain can differ in their aging-related somatic mutation processes. Our results further suggest that key features that distinguish Purkinje neurons from granule neurons, such as cell size, metabolic rates, and neuronal firing rates, are unlikely to be intrinsic determinants of the total substitution mutation rate and of signature SBS5, which is the most prevalent aging-related mutational process.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

We found that birds became hormonally aroused in the dark long before initiating dawn singing, and that suppression of spontaneous singing by darkness enhanced their intrinsic motivation to sing. This elevated motivation subsequently triggered a rebound of intensive singing at dawn. Moreover, dawn singing accelerated refinement of song structure, supporting its role as intensive vocal exercise to optimize song performance after overnight silence. These findings provide mechanistic and functional explanations for the dawn chorus.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

To efficiently allocate cognitive resources and avoid inferring spurious patterns, organisms must distinguish learnable from unlearnable associations, but the mechanisms underlying this ability are not understood. We recently showed that monkeys performing a transitive inference task, while discovering the true hidden order in learnable image sets, also behaved to varying degrees as if they inferred subjective order in objectively random (unlearnable) image sets. Here, we show that the ability to detect learnability is encoded by neurons in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC, area 24c). dACC neurons responded strongly after a decision outcome as reported in previous studies and, additionally, signaled whether a trial was from a learnable vs unlearnable set before outcome delivery, and showed interactions whereby their selectivity for the outcome (reward vs lack of reward) was stronger for learnable versus unlearnable sets. Learnability and interaction responses were independent of sensory or reward cues (which were equated for learnable and unlearnable sets) but their strength correlated with the monkeys ability to avoid inferring false order in unlearnable sets. The findings suggest that the dACC is part of a network that monitors learnability and enables animals to appropriately focus learning on true patterns while avoiding false inferences about spurious and random associations.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

AngII was used to stimulate myocardial cells for 72 hours, inducing cardiomyocyte hypertrophy; Use RIPK3 inhibitor GSK'872 to reduce RIPK3 expression. Detect indicators related to myocardial hypertrophy, cell damage, necroptosis,CaMKII activation and gene expression, oxidative stress, mitochondrial membrane potential, etc. After AngII stimulation of cardiomyocytes, the expression of hypertrophy markers ANP and BNP increased, LDH release increased, ATP levels decreased, splicing factors ASF and SC35 expression increased, CaMKII oxidation and phosphorylation levels increased, and CaMKII{delta} alternative splicing was disrupted. However, treatment with GSK'872 can alleviate myocardial dysfunction, inhibit CaMKII activation, correct CaMKII{delta} variant splicing disorder and ultimately alleviating myocardial hypertrophy. In addition, pretreatment with RIPK3 can reduce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by AngII, decrease the activity of ASF and SC35, and restore mitochondrial membrane potential.

While condensin complexes are critical for the formation of rod-shaped mitotic chromosomes, additional mechanisms -particularly those involving phosphorylation and deacetylation of specific histone residues - have been proposed to contribute a further 2- to 4-fold reduction in mitotic chromatin volume. In this study, we employ high-resolution mass spectrometry to determine the kinetics of histone modifications in cell cultures undergoing a highly synchronous mitotic entry at 2.5-minute resolution. Our analysis reveals three different programmes of histone H3 phosphorylation on T3, S10 and S28. These modifications are consistent with methyl-phos switches regulating the association of readers with chromatin other than at promoters. Mass spectrometry and quantitative ChIP-Seq reveal that H3 T3 phosphorylation is a general marker of heterochromatin and not specifically centromeres as previously suggested. Finally, we show that histone acetylation undergoes only modest changes as rod-shaped chromosomes form during unperturbed mitotic entry. Thus, previously reported reductions in acetylation associated with chromosome formation were apparently attributable to delays in mitotic exit used as part of mitotic synchronisation protocols. The mechanism of condensin-independent chromatin compaction in mitosis remains unexplained.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

While the Rho GTPase RhoA is well known to regulate the actomyosin cytoskeleton, its function in controlling the septin cytoskeleton remains unclear. As RhoA interactions can vary in both time and space, they can be challenging to discern from traditional bulk biochemical assays. Here we use multiple optogenetic tools to spatially and temporally increase myosin localization, stimulate contractile force, and activate RhoA, to investigate how RhoA and its downstream effector myosin impact the septin cytoskeleton. We find that neither local accumulation of myosin nor increased activity of myosin is sufficient to alter septin architecture. Local activation of RhoA, however, results in a local increase in septin accumulation. Importantly, this septin increase is independent of the scaffolding protein anillin, which can directly bind both septin and RhoA. Together these data expand the potential role of septins in mediating RhoA signaling by stimulating the remodeling of the septin cytoskeleton.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Pathway analysis reveals that methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase (AUH) drives 2HMS synthesis through a CoA-independent conversion (CIC) pathway. This pathway is distinct from the CoA-dependent conversion (CDC) pathway that generates mesaconate and itaconyl-CoA influencing B12-dependent processes.

Here, we characterize PMVEC alterations in IPF using single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics, identifying subtype-specific markers and demonstrating their progressive loss in fibrotic lungs. To model endothelial dysfunction, we established robust protocols for isolating and culturing primary human ECs and applied a pharmacologically relevant cytokine cocktail (IPF-RC) that mimics the IPF microenvironment. IPF-RC exposure induced hallmark features of endothelial injury, including VE-cadherin loss, increased ICAM1/VCAM1 signaling, impaired barrier integrity, and reduced wound healing and angiogenic capacity. To address the need for translational tools in drug discovery, we optimized and validated a suite of functional, scalable test systems and their endpoints using both primary and commercial endothelial cells. These mechanistic assays reliably recapitulate fibrotic endothelial injury and enable quantitative assessment of therapeutic interventions. Notably, treatment with a cAMP analog partially restored endothelial function, supporting the utility of these models for regenerative and pharmacological screening. Our findings position PMVECs as active participants in IPF progression and present novel, scalable test systems that bridge mechanistic insight with translational application.

Influenza A virus (IAV), a respiratory pathogen, takes advantage of clathrin-dependent endocytosis or macropinocytosis for its internalization. Here, we report that TRIM62, a member of the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family, is required for IAV entry, independent of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. We find that TRIM62 specifically functions in a clathrin-independent, lipid raft-mediated pathway, which IAV exploits to enter the endocytic network. Additionally, we reveal the involvement of the WASH complex and the retromer component VPS35 in this pathway beyond their canonical functions in endosomal sorting. We observe that a pool of WASH and VPS35 localize to the plasma membrane and associate with lipid rafts, in addition to their typical endosomal presence. While WASH subunits except FAM21 play a proviral role in IAV endocytosis and intracellular trafficking, VPS35 acts antagonistically. We show that TRIM62 counteracts the antiviral function of VPS35 by limiting FAM21-VPS35 interaction. By directly binding WASH in the cytosol, TRIM62 restricts its VPS35-mediated endosomal recruitment and thereby enhances its surface availability to facilitate IAV entry. Together, this study uncovers previously unrecognized roles of TRIM62 and endosomal sorting machinery in IAV entry, offering new antiviral targets.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

While there is growing understanding of the immune cells involved in HP, the relationship between clinical outcomes and circulating cell types in HP is not well established. Methods: Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 40 patients with fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (fHP) in a clinical trial of pirfenidone (NCT02958917). After quality control, we compared data from 33 fHP patients with 36 sex-matched healthy controls (GSE196735). Using Seurat v5, we harmonized the data, formed clusters, and reduced dimensionality through UMAP. Cell type identities were assigned based on a published reference (GSE271789), with clusters annotated for predominant cell type(s) present in at least 30% of the cells. We compared cell type proportions between fHP and HC using the chi-squared test and performed differential expression analysis with DESeq2 on pseudobulk counts, adjusting for sex. Genes significantly upregulated in fHP versus HC at an FDR-adjusted p-value of 0.01 were used to create a multivariate predictive signature for clinical outcomes in fHP participants. Performance was assessed through leave-one-out cross-validation for prediction accuracy. Results: Compared to HC, fHP has an increased proportion of non-classical CD16+ monocytes (4.2% fHP vs. 1.5% HC), C14+ monocytes with a myeloid-derived dendritic phenotype (2.1% fHP vs. 0.1% HC), platelets (1.0% fHP vs. 0.3% HC), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (0.5% fHP vs. 0.1% HC) and predominantly classical CD14+ monocytes (29.5% fHP vs. 3.4% HC, adjusted-p<0.001). In patients with fHP, cell clusters were associated with the presence of baseline chest CT honeycombing, increased extent of CT lung fibrosis, and worse progression-free survival. CD14+ monocytes consistently demonstrated a high prediction accuracy (>0.90) for these clinical metrics.

Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) estimate the aggregate effects of multiple genetic variants on complex diseases and represent a promising approach to address the limitations of GWAS. In particular, TWAS provides insights into the functional consequences of disease-associated SNPs by linking them to gene transcription, thereby offering a mechanistic understanding that GWAS alone cannot provide. However, TWAS associated variants have been annotated with the closest or most biologically relevant candidate gene within arbitrarily defined distances but fails to account for long distance SNPs which can affect many genes and have a widespread impact on regulatory networks. Therefore, there is a need to leverage these observed enrichments and build a method that incorporates both short and long distance-associations between SNPs and complex phenotypes.

We benchmarked our method on GTEx brain cortex genotype and expression data together with the corresponding Hi-C data.

T.", "abstract": "Paclitaxel (taxol) is a commonly used chemotherapeutic that stabilizes microtubules to inhibit chromosome segregation during mitosis. Although it is used effectively to treat a wide variety of solid tumour types, it also impairs healthy cell proliferation leading to severe dose-limiting toxicities. Newer anti-mitotic drugs have been developed but these have so far failed to offer the same clinical benefit as paclitaxel, which begs the question of why this drug targets tumour cells so effectively? Here we develop a mathematical model of paclitaxel penetration and retention within 3D tumour environments following periodic drug-on/drug-off regimes typically used in the clinic. Our model suggests that during the drug-free periods, dense poorly-perfused tissue can retain paclitaxel for much longer than well-perfused tissue. This is due to paclitaxel's ability to bind strongly to microtubules, which causes slower drug-release from densely packed tissue. Assuming that tumour cells are generally dense and less perfused than proliferative healthy tissues, this simple model suggests that tumour-selective killing could be achieved later in each chemotherapy cycle when the drug has otherwise cleared the healthy cell compartments. We use our model to optimize dosing regimens to allow paclitaxel to selectively kill tumour spheroids of different size, whilst sparing well-perfused healthy cells. Together, our model suggests paclitaxel could target key distinguishing features of many solid tumours: their size, 3D geometry and perfusion status.

This study investigates how elevating MAP, and thereby increasing renal perfusion pressure (RPP, defined as MAP-CVP), influences renal hemodynamics, microcirculation, and oxygen metabolism in a septic shock model.Methods: Sixteen New Zealand rabbits of either sex and similar weight were randomly assigned to sham group (n=8) and septic shock group (n=8). Renal blood flow (RBF), microcirculatory blood flow and velocity in the kidney, as well as tissue oxygen pressure in the renal cortex and medulla, were assessed at four distinct time points: baseline (T0), model establishment (T1), restoration of MAP to baseline levels (T2), and an increase in MAP by more than 15% above baseline (T3). Results:Within the septic shock group, although MAP and consequent RPP were increased, RBF markedly decreased from 17.63{+/-}2.50 to 8.50{+/-}1.93 ml/min (p < 0.05). No significant changes in microcirculation blood flow or flow velocity were observed between T2 and T3. Tissue oxygen pressure in the renal cortex and medulla declined significantly from 21.20{+/-}1.80 to 17.14{+/-}(p < 0.05) and from37.74{+/-}4.85 to 24.34{+/-}3.74 (p < 0.05), respectively. Conclusion: Elevating RPP does not improve RBF, renal microcirculation, or tissue oxygen pressure in the renal cortex or medulla in septic shock. Elevating RPP does not improve RBF, renal microcirculation, or tissue oxygen pressure in the renal cortex or medulla in septic shock. We advocate restoring MAP to the baseline level rather than increasing it further to enhance renal perfusion pressure.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

We present data demonstrating sex differences in latent inhibition of contextual fear conditioning and associated gene expression in the hippocampus in rodents, supporting sex differences in latent inhibition at the behavioural and neurobiological levels.

Functional characterization revealed that the centenarian variants endogenously elevated SIRT6 protein levels through weakened interaction with vimentin, and altered SIRT6 enzymatic activities including enhanced mono-ADP-ribosyl transferase activity and reduced deacetylase activity. These variants delayed replicative and progerin-induced cellular senescence, preserving genome stability through maintenance of DNA repair pathways and suppression of transposable element derepression.

Collagen-I was periodically paired with Gefitinib and we observed that conditioned cells progressive decreased migration velocity on collagen-I but not on other extracellular matrix components. We identified the adenosine receptor ADORA2A as a key actor regulating the acquisition of associative memory. We also observed that the magnitude of the conditioned response oscillated over time with the same periodicity as paired stimuli presentations during conditioning. We found that mitochondria morphology oscillated with the same periodicity, suggesting that memory and energy metabolisms are linked.

While mitochondrial dysfunction is common in type 2 diabetes, it remains unclear whether cristae density is reduced and whether it can be improved by exercise training. We therefore investigated the mitochondrial cristae density in skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 diabetes compared with glucose-tolerant obese and lean individuals, and examined the effect of high-intensity interval training (HIIT). Methods: In a non-randomized intervention study, male participants (aged 40-65 years) with type 2 diabetes (n=15), weight-matched obese controls (n=15), and lean controls (n=18) completed an 8-week supervised HIIT intervention combining rowing and cycling. Muscle biopsies from the m. vastus lateralis were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to quantify mitochondrial cristae density (cristae surface area per mitochondrial volume) and to derive cristae surface area per muscle volume, integrating mitochondrial abundance and ultrastructure. To ensure high stereological precision, a minimum of 49 mitochondrial profiles per sample were analyzed. Results: No differences in mitochondrial cristae density were observed between groups at baseline. HIIT induced an ~7% increase in cristae density across all groups, with the most pronounced adaptations in type 2 fibers and in the intermyofibrillar compartment. At baseline, patients with type 2 diabetes exhibited lower cristae surface area per muscle volume compared with lean controls. Notably, cristae surface area per muscle volume increased more than mitochondrial volume density alone, reflecting combined structural and volumetric remodeling. Conclusions/interpretation: Skeletal muscle mitochondrial cristae density is not different between patients with type 2 diabetes and glucose-tolerant obese and lean controls, and the capacity for cristae remodeling in response to exercise is not affected by type 2 diabetes. These findings highlight the plasticity of mitochondrial architecture and support HIIT as a potent stimulus for improving muscle oxidative and metabolic health, also in type 2 diabetes.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Yet, which fluorophore works best in vivo can depend on a range of factors, both extrinsic (e.g. pH, temperature) and intrinsic (e.g. photobleaching, brightness). While fluorophores have been well characterised in cell culture, such measures within in vivo systems are more limited. Here, we present a quantitative screen of nine green and eight red fluorophore lines in Drosophila, with the fluorescent protein expressed from the same genomic location and imaged under identical conditions. We analyse the expression of the fluorophores in both early and late Drosophila embryos. We provide a quantitative analysis of the bleaching and folding rates. We find amongst the green fluorophores that the suitable choice - e.g., mEGFP, mNeonGreen, mStayGold - depends on timing and imaging requirements.

Within a millisecond, saturating agonist concentrations trigger activity bursts consisting of high-frequency fluctuations between conductive and non-conductive states. These can last for tens to hundreds of milliseconds until, stochastically, receptors adopt stable, long-lived, desensitised conformations. This highly dynamic process, known as gating, controls transient passages of chloride ions across plasma membranes to enable neurotransmission and other fundamental processes in animal physiology. The conformational transitions inside activity bursts, inferred from electrophysiology, have remained inaccessible to structural biology investigation. Here we describe the gating motions of three GABAA receptor variants imaged within the first 10 milliseconds of agonist application by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We illustrate how activation and desensitisation proceed through multiple asymmetric states, supported by major secondary, tertiary and quaternary structural rearrangements, and demonstrate that the same gating principles apply to both homomeric and heteromeric GABAARs. Furthermore, we show that cholesterol and phospholipids stabilise newly formed inter-subunit interfaces and obstruct channel pores in short-lived desensitised states, while phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) precludes the opening of both 1{beta}3 and 1{beta}3{gamma}2 GABAAR channels. Our results provide a novel framework to interpret decades of electrophysiology observations and suggest a broadly applicable approach to investigate mechanistically the vast arrays of physiological and pharmacological modulators of GABAARs and other fast neurotransmitter receptors.

Its pathogenicity depends on a temperature-triggered shift from saprophytic mold (25{degrees}C) to pathogenic yeast (37{degrees}C), and the two growth forms display distinct sensitivity to antifungal drugs, which processes involve extensive cell wall structure and components remodeling. To dissect these processes, we use solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) and other techniques to show that T. marneffei yeast and hyphal cells have distinct cell wall thickness and hydrophobicity, and different assembly of mobile and rigid polymers within the T. marneffei cell wall. The yeast wall was 2.3 times thicker and more hydrated. ssNMR revealed a rigid core of {beta}-1,3-glucans, chitin and chitosan, with {beta}-1,3-glucan rising from 57% in mold to 72% in yeast.

Here we document an oncogenic role for STAT1 in Multiple Myeloma (MM), wherein STAT1 regulates Kaiso expression, represses bmf and is essential for MM cell survival. Moreover, STAT1 is constitutively phosphorylated in MM cell lines and patient derived primary MM cells and STAT1-depletion resulted in reduced Kaiso levels. Importantly, expression of exogenous Kaiso rescued STAT1-depleted MM cells from apoptosis by reversing elevated BMF levels. Further, several MM cell lines harboring diverse oncogenic mutations rely on Kaiso for their survival revealing an oncogenic addiction to Kaiso in MM. Mechanistically, Kaiso interacts with and recruits HDAC1 to pro-apoptotic gene bmf promoter to maintain repressive state. In line with this, depletion of Kaiso or HDAC1 results in elevated BMF levels and apoptosis of MM cells. Kaiso is abundantly expressed in several MM cell lines and patient derived primary MM cells. Interestingly, Kaiso interacting partner p120-catenin levels are very low/undetectable in MM indicating that Kaiso function in MM is p120-independent. While previous reports suggested anoikis promoting role for Kaiso in breast cancer, we show here that bmf repression by Kaiso is central to anoikis-resistance of metastatic solid tumors. Collectively, our data indicate that Kaiso is a downstream effector for STAT1 in MM cell survival and that Kaiso mediated bmf repression is central to MM cell survival and anoikis resistance of metastatic solid tumors.

Our integrative analyses, utilizing both bulk and single-nucleus transcriptomics, revealed that the FTE cells are indeed highly heterogeneous, consisting of multiple subtypes of secretory and ciliated cells in addition to a small stem cell pool. In the adult fallopian tube, the LGR5+/PGR+ stem cells, often situated in the basal layer of the FTE, can proliferate and differentiate into OVGP1+/RNPC3+ progenitors, constituting the predominant cell types in all segments of the fallopian tube. These progenitors can quickly differentiate into ciliated or mature secretory cells to replenish the lost FTE cells when needed. Exposure to certain oncogenic factors may cause the progenitors to undergo carcinogenesis along two differentiation pathways, forming mesenchymal-like and immunoreactive cancerous cells, commonly seen in HGSOC.

Caveolin-3 contributes to T-tubule formation and excitation-contraction coupling. BIN1 (amphiphysin 2), a membrane-shaping protein critical for T-tubule integrity, has shown therapeutic promise in congenital myopathies and heart dysfunction. To date, there are no therapy for caveolinopathies. Methods: We evaluated the therapeutic impact of BIN1 overexpression in Cav-3 knockout mice, a model recapitulating key features of human caveolinopathy. We assessed skeletal and cardiac function, T-tubule morphology, mitochondria, and gene expression using histological, physiological, and molecular approaches. Results: We found Cav-3-/- mice displayed skeletal muscle weakness, T-tubule disorganization, and mitochondrial abnormalities, alongside cardiac diastolic dysfunction and myofibrillar disarray. While BIN1 overexpression failed to improve skeletal muscle strength, T-tubule structure, or fiber atrophy, it corrected nuclear positioning and partially restored mitochondrial markers. In contrast, BIN1 robustly rescued cardiac performance, restoring end-diastolic volume, cardiac output, and sarcomeric integrity. Expression profiling revealed greater dysregulation of excitation-contraction coupling and atrogene pathways in skeletal than in cardiac muscle. Cavin-4, a BIN1-interacting protein, was selectively dysregulated in Cav3-/- muscle, suggesting a mechanistic barrier to BIN1-mediated rescue in this tissue.

While significant progress has been made in understanding how animals learn which stimuli predict positive and negative outcomes, how the outputs of associative learning circuits flexibly promote different behaviours, depending on context, is not well understood. Addressing this question requires mapping the pathways from learning circuits to nerve cord command neurons that promote specific actions, and understanding where and how contextual information converges with these pathways to modulate their activity. These are daunting tasks in larger brains where synaptic-resolution connectivity maps are not available. We, therefore, addressed this question in the tractable Drosophila larva using a combination of connectomic analyses, imaging and manipulation of neural activity and behavioural analysis. We characterised, with synaptic-resolution, the pathways from the higher-order learning circuit (the mushroom body, MB) all the way to a specific cord command neuron (Goro) in the nerve cord that promotes the most vigorous escape response, rolling. Rolling is the fastest, but also the most energetically costly escape response and is activated by multisensory cues in the context of predator attack. We identify a pair of brain descending neurons, Ipsigoro, that integrate learnt information (via input from MBONs) and nociceptive context (via input from ascending neurons) to facilitate rolling via direct inputs to Goro.

Here we report that NEK7 accelerates, but is in principle dispensable for NLRP3 activation. The onset of inflammasome activation was unaltered in the absence of NEK7, yet the rate of cells to undergo inflammasome formation and subsequent pyroptosis was approximately 4-fold reduced. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of the NEK7-NLRP3 interaction might have an incomplete effect, which should be considered for drug development. We confirmed entrectinib as a NEK7-dependent inhibitor, while other published compounds turned out not to rely on it.

By directly sensing cello-oligomers, IGP1 acts as a cell wall sentinel that links pathogen-induced wall degradation to immune alerting, equipping plants to mount rapid and robust defense responses.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

While new sensing technologies are being developed, quantifying improvement in measurement efficiency and data quality, relative to traditional techniques, is lacking. In this study, we use LiDAR to generate 3D scans of corn and soybean plots and evaluate two computational methods: a gap fraction approach to estimate LAI and a persistent homology algorithm to estimate stand count by detecting structural peaks in the canopy. Validation experiments and statistical comparisons of bias and variance demonstrate that LiDAR-derived LAI estimates in corn are comparable in quality to those from established instruments. However, in soybean, the LiDAR method performs poorly, likely due to dense canopies limiting light penetration and structural differentiation. Stand count estimations in corn closely match manual counts, with the added benefit of full-plot coverage and significantly faster data collection. In soybean, stand count estimates are unreliable under dense canopy conditions. These results offer practical guidance for the use of LiDAR in field phenotyping and highlight both its current capabilities and limitations. While a trade-off between speed and precision remains, particularly in high-density canopies, LiDAR's scalability and multi-trait potential make it a promising tool for high-throughput breeding programs. Continued improvements in LiDAR hardware and algorithm design may further enhance measurement accuracy and extend applicability across crops and growth stages.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

We identify BLTP1 as a phospholipid transporter that exports phospholipids from mitochondria to maintain lipid homeostasis. The outer mitochondrial membrane protein FKBP8 recruits BLTP1 to ER-mitochondrial contact sites, establishing a dedicated lipid export pathway. BLTP1 deficiency triggers pathological accumulation of phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), and cardiolipin (CL) within mitochondria. This lipid overload is associated with elevation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), bioenergetic dysfunction, and apoptosis. Critically, depleting intramitochondrial lipid transfer proteins (e.g., PRELID1) or enzymes in the CL synthesis pathway (e.g., PTPMT1, CRLS1) prevents apoptosis caused by BLTP1 deficiency. Our findings defines a BLTP1-FKBP8-dependent mechanism for mitochondrial phospholipid efflux that is essential for mitochondrial function and cell survival.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "To achieve proper cell and tissue size, cytoplasmic and nuclear growth must be coordinated. Disrupting this coordination causes birth defects and disease. In the largest cells in nature, nuclear growth occurs through polyploidization (whole-genome-duplication). How the massive nuclear growth of polyploid cells is coordinated with cytoplasmic growth processes such as mitochondrial biogenesis is relatively unclear. Here, focusing on one of the most commonly polyploid organs- the heart- we uncover cross-talk between cytoplasmic mitochondrial biogenesis/integrity and nuclear growth/polyploidy. From a human-to-fly screen, we uncover novel regulators of cardiomyocyte ploidy, including mitochondrial integrity regulators. In comparing these cardiac hits with a parallel screen in another polyploid tissue, the salivary gland, we discovered two opposing roles for Cytochrome-c-oxidase-subunit-7A (COX7A). While salivary gland COX7A preserves mitochondrial integrity to promote polyploidy and optimal organ growth, cardiac COX7A instead suppresses mitochondrial biogenesis to repress polyploidy and prevent hypertrophic organ growth. Among all electron transport chain genes, only COX7A functions as a cardiac growth repressor. Fly hearts with compromised COX7A show abnormally high cardiac output. Human COX7A1, a mitochondrial-localized protein, similarly represses polyploidy of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. In summary, our human-fly-human approach reveals conserved rewiring of mitochondrial integrity in heart tissue that switches the role of COX7A from ploidy promotion to repression. Our findings reveal fundamental cross-talk between mitochondrial biogenesis and genome duplication that are critical in growing metazoan tissues.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

The latter implies that LCBD--environment relationships can strongly depend on how the environment is sampled. To address this issue, we introduce Generalised Dissimilarity Uniqueness Models (GDUM), a framework that embeds effects on community uniqueness within pairwise dissimilarity modelling. GDUMs are consistent with conventional uniqueness models, while explicitly accounting for directional changes in composition. This distinction disentangles directional and non-directional drivers of beta diversity, such as environmental filtering versus stochastic processes.

A.", "abstract": "In nature, survival requires coping with complex time-changing situations in real time. In this process, memory plays a major role since the retrieval of critical information is key to rapid and reliable decision making. This work explores modulation of human memory under the hypothesis that in dynamic scenarios such critical information is encoded as a static map of future interactions. Specifically, the reported results show that dynamic visual stimuli that contain future interactions are better recalled than equivalent stimuli that do not. This is in line with the proposed hypothesis since the former type of stimulus would be encoded in a more simplified way than the latter. Moreover, dynamic stimuli with future interactions are better recalled than simpler dynamic stimuli, which reinforces that the former are processed by a static representation - their map of interactions. This cognitive strategy seems to be modulated by the complexity of the stimulus, since in simple situations differences in recall appear only in men, whereas when complexity increases, such differences do not show gender bias. Therefore, this work proposes an answer to how memory can help us reliably cope with dynamic situations, demonstrating that those critical for survival (such as fighting, chasing, fleeing, etc., which involve interactions) are better remembered, allowing more efficient learning and decision making, essential to deal with our complex and changing world.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Here we ask, which strategies humans employ when assessing whether or not an object will fit into a cavity. To this end, objects and cavities were presented with different orientations on a computer screen and we measured errors, reaction-times and gaze patterns, where the latter can point to different problem-solving strategies. On the one hand our findings confirm that simpler configurations are solved faster and more efficiently than more complex ones. On the other hand, by analyzing about 80,000 gazes, we observed that participants used three different strategies. In many instances, the investigated task - featuring relatively large objects - could be completed using only peripheral vision (37%). In a larger number of cases quite \"specific\" gaze patterns were observed, primarily focusing on the Gestalt of a concave corner (46%). Less frequently, but still notably often, participants employed a strategy of fixating near to object or cavity (17%), potentially minimizing the length of the required saccadic eye movements while relying on perifoveal/peripheral vision. Ultimately, these findings highlight the crucial roles of proximity, spatial orientation, and visual cues in object recognition tasks, suggesting that the perceptual strategies used depend on distinct aspects of the object configurations.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

We found that MIR155HG (miR155 host gene) colocalizes with APP (amyloid-beta precursor protein) in a neuron-specific, topologically-associated domain (TAD) within a regulatory network, in the obligate portion of chromosome 21 triplicated in DS which causes AD neuropathology and in most cases, dementia. We investigated miR155 role during neuron development and then validated these findings in an amyloidopathy model. In human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neural stem cells (NSCs), cortical neurons and cortical organoids, MIR155 deletion enhanced NSC proliferation, ventral patterning and GABAergic interneuron generation.

In an amyloidopathy mouse model, miR155 deletion induced the expansion of hippocampal NSCs and increased hippocampal GABAergic interneurons. These findings reveal previously unrecognized miR155 roles in NSC dynamics and GABAergic interneuron development which directionally diverge from extensively studied microglial miR155 in their beneficial vs negative impact on AD mouse models, suggesting that approaching miR155 therapeutically may require balancing the effects in neurons and microglia.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Consistent with our interpretation, we found in the larval brain synaptic connectivity patterns characteristic of the adult, including (i) visual input into the PB and EB; (ii) modulation of CX neuropil inputs by the mushroom body (MB); (iii) reciprocal connectivity between CX neuropils and select MB compartments; and (iv) strong connectivity between CX neuropils.

However, the molecular pathways and RNAs regulated by Imp to control these processes remain poorly understood. Embryos derived from Imp mutant germline clones arrest development, and transcriptome analysis revealed significant dysregulation of genes involved in cell growth, differentiation, tube morphogenesis, neuronal projection development, and RNA metabolism, along with de-repression of transposable element (TE) RNAs. Consistent with these findings, Imp mutant embryos display TE-overexpression phenotypes, are smaller in size, and exhibit defective organ development, including impaired tracheal branching and gastrulation. Reduced levels of Imp at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) impair synaptic bouton formation and decrease adult longevity. RIP-seq experiments showed that Imp-associated RNAs are enriched for TE RNAs. Proteomic analyses confirmed that several TE-encoded proteins are upregulated in Imp mutant embryos. Specifically, the Ty1 family retrotransposon Copia was derepressed. Consistent with recent findings that Copia is a potent inhibitor of synaptogenesis, its upregulation likely contributes to the impaired NMJ formation and broader embryonic defects observed in Imp mutants. Moreover, Imp associates with piRNA pathway proteins, ensures Piwi nuclear localization, and -like piwi mutants- its loss disrupts TE silencing and causes position-effect variegation (PEV) defects. The analysis of Imp complexes further points to potential mechanisms by which Imp may regulate TE expression. Overall, these results indicate that Imp maintains genome stability and ensures proper developmental progression and neuronal activity by regulating post-transcriptional processes and suppressing transposons.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Emerging views of this dynamic subnuclear structure place it as a hub of RNA processing, impacting steps from transcription to export. To manage this complex microcosm of RNA metabolism, nuclear speckles also require kinases and phosphorylation to execute their functions. The nuclear speckle-localized kinase, TAOK2, mediates the splicing and export of viral transcripts at the nuclear speckle, but its role in the processing of cellular transcripts was unknown. We used siRNA knockdown of TAOK2 and assessed RNA transcripts in both whole cell and nucleocytoplasmic fractions to characterize the complete endogenous effects of TAOK2. We found that TAOK2 knockdown impacts over 10% of the transcriptome, through changes in alternative splicing, export and transcript abundance. Cellular and biochemical phosphoproteomics further revealed nuclear speckle scaffolding proteins SRRM1 and SRRM2 as potential direct phosphorylation targets of TAOK2, mediating its large effects on speckle integrity and speckle-localized splicing. Indeed, knockdown of TAOK2 perturbs almost all speckle-resident serine/arginine (SR)-rich proteins while leaving heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins unperturbed.

Although all compounds abolish proton gradients in a canonical concentration-dependent manner (IC50 of 0.2 nM, 0.6 nM, and 41 nM, respectively), they leave the proton transport rate of active V-ATPases essentially unchanged. Instead, inhibitors modulate the reversible switching kinetics between ultralong-lived active (pumping) and inactive modes.

In melanoma, tumor-intrinsic glutamine metabolism and the anti-tumor interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}) immune response are critical opposing factors. We hypothesized that the interplay between these two pathways, termed a 'metabolic conflict', could be captured by a transcriptional signature to stratify patients and predict clinical outcomes. Methods: We developed transcriptional signatures for glutamine metabolism and IFN{gamma} response pathways and calculated per-sample enrichment scores using Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA). We analyzed a discovery cohort of 469 melanoma patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA-SKCM) to assess the signature's prognostic value. We then tested its predictive value for anti-PD-1 therapy in an independent validation cohort of 49 melanoma patients from GEO (GSE91061). Results: In the TCGA cohort, the glutamine metabolism and IFN{gamma} response scores were negatively correlated (Pearson r = -0.412), supporting the concept of a metabolic-immune conflict. Stratifying patients into four metabolic-immune groups revealed a trend towards improved overall survival for the 'Favorable' group (Low Glutamine/High IFN{gamma}), but this did not reach statistical significance (log-rank p = 0.081). Cox proportional hazards models confirmed the signature lacked independent prognostic value when adjusted for clinical covariates. In the immunotherapy-treated validation cohort, the signature failed to predict clinical response to anti-PD-1 therapy (Chi-squared p = 0.706).

In mammals, cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor  (TNF ) and Interleukin 1{beta} (IL1 {beta}) promote sleep. In Drosophila, infection stimulates the systemic release of a battery of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs). These fly immune effectors have been understudied as sleep modulators. We obtained mutants in different AMPs and characterized their functions in sleep and sleep dependent outputs. AMP mutants sleep less with a longer sleep latency, and low-ered arousal thresholds. Group C mutant flies, doubly mutant for the anti-fungal peptides Metchinikowin (Mtk) and Drosomycin (Drs), showed the greatest impairments. These Group C mutants also showed an exaggerated sleep rebound. Sleep rebound was unaltered in other mutants. Different sets of AMP mutants exhibited specific disrup-tions in socialization and rocking induced sleep. These data are a detailed characterization of sleep regulation in AMP mutants. We also evaluated sleep functions. Group C mutants uniquely exhibited normal learning and memory, and lower synapse abundance, despite sleeping the least. Group C mutants are thus able to carry out some sleep functions without sleeping very much. Glial knockdown of Metchnikowin and Drosomycin mimicked the sleep phenotypes of the null mutants, these genes thus act from glia. Sleep and memory defects in AMP mutants was reversible - enhancing sleep of Bomanin mutants pharmacologically or behaviorally improved learning and memory.

However, they are also expressed in many normal cells and tissues, including lymphocytes, but their physiological role is less well-understood. Here, we investigated the role of MDR1 in tumor-specific CD8 T cells (TST), which are critical in antitumor immunity and key targets of immunotherapies. Using a clinically-relevant genetic liver cancer mouse model, we investigated the efflux dynamics of TST as they underwent activation, proliferation, and differentiation to dysfunctional states in tumor-bearing hosts. Surprisingly, we found that late-stage/terminally dysfunctional TST had the highest efflux capacity in both murine and human liver tumors. TST upregulated transcription of Abcb1a, encoding MDR1. We used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate MDR1-deficient TST, which persisted poorly in tumor-bearing mice as compared to MDR1-sufficient TST. MDR1 expression improved TST viability and reduced reactive oxygen species accumulation. Loss of MDR1 made T cells more susceptible to cytotoxic chemotherapy-induced cell death. Our findings demonstrate a role for MDR1 in regulating TST persistence and oxidative stress, with implications for antitumor T cell therapies in patients and immune regulation following cytotoxic chemotherapy.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

In developing chick skin, we previously demonstrated that a transient standing electrical current loop forms within individual feather buds as they start to elongate. Current flows into the feather bud tip via calcium channels, facilitating collective distal dermal cell movement, thus determining bud orientations. Here, we further evaluate the hypothesis that potassium channels carry the current that flows out of the bud base. We found potassium channel blockers convert periodic feather primordia into horizontal stripes and alter bud aspect ratios by disrupting the bud elongation process. Bioelectric characterization showed the entire current loop is altered, not only the outward current at the base, but also the inward current at the feather bud tip. In situ hybridization shows beta-catenin and Sonic Hedgehog, both feather bud markers, are reduced, resulting in altered periodic patterning and bud shaping. These findings show that a complex multiscale interdependency of ion channel function across a multicellular cell collective is essential for periodic feather patterning and shaping of 3-dimensional feather architecture during skin morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

M.; Knutsen, H.; Oomen, R.", "abstract": "Life-history divergence between Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) ecotypes in Skagerrak is maintained despite gene flow. Fjord and North Sea ecotypes differ in growth, body size, and reproductive ecology. One environmental heterogeneity in Skagerrak is salinity, as coastal habitats experience substantially lower and more variable salinities than offshore waters. Egg buoyancy is highly sensitive to salinity and represents a critical life-history trait shaping survival and recruitment. Inversions on chromosomes 2, 7, and 12 in cod are linked to salinity adaptation and might be important for egg buoyancy and survival. Here, we conducted a buoyancy test on Atlantic cod eggs, spawned from North Sea and Fjord ecotypes, using Coombs apparatus. Genotypes for the inversions on chromosomes 2, 7, and 12 and ecotype were determined in all individuals (N=242). We hypothesized that individuals with different inversion genotypes and ecotypes would have divergent buoyancies. We found that buoyancy was variable and followed a bimodal distribution sorted by ecotype, with Fjord and North Sea individuals having mean buoyancies at neutral salinity (at 7 degrees celcius) of 27 and 31 ppt, respectively. Therefore, individuals with intermediate buoyancies might be selected against. This finding is consistent with our expectations, as Fjord ecotypes experience lower salinities compared to North Sea ecotypes. Interestingly, there was little evidence that the inversions on chromosomes 2, 7, and 12 impacted buoyancy. Overall, we provide experimental evidence of the relative contributions of ecotypic background and inversions on a key life history trait, which helps to explain the maintained divergence among ecotypes.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

We have recently shown that mesothelin-targeting CAR T cells co-transduced with cytokine-binding synthetic velocity receptors (VRs, referred to as CAR TV cells) demonstrate increased motility, improved infiltration in solid primary tumors, and lead to a better anti-tumor effect compared to CAR T cells that do not express VRs. However, it is metastasis that causes the vast majority of cancer related deaths and is difficult to target clinically, indicating an urgent unmet need. We show that these CAR T cells engineered to be hyper-migratory using VRs are highly effective against liver metastasis of ovarian cancer along different stages of the metastatic cascade. Mesothelin-targeting CAR TV cells expressing synthetic or native receptors responsive to the cytokine Interleukin-5 improved the survival of mice bearing an extremely high or terminal level of metastatic burden compared to CAR T cells that did not express VRs. Against newly established metastatic lesions and lesions undergoing metastatic outgrowth, CAR TV cells showed a robust anti-cancer effect resulting in an improved prognosis compared to control CAR T cells. Histopathological assessments showed a substantial reduction of metastasis number and lesion size with CAR TV treatment, concomitant with increased immune cell infiltration in the metastatic regions.

We identify and characterize the presence of this edge effect in NanoEP systems, and develop a modified Nernst-Planck model to guide the design of membrane geometries that either promote delivery uniformity or create prescribed spatial gradients within cell monolayers. By varying the internal angles formed by the membrane edges (60{degrees}, 90{degrees}, 120{degrees}), we create predictable intracellular cargo gradients, while concave \"serpentine\" geometries with high perimeter-to-area ratios amplify delivery efficiency and minimize spatial heterogeneity compared to circular membranes.

They also provide knowledge into host responses to pathogen infections. Not common yet is to detect transcripts from multiple interacting organisms present in a given sample. In addition, transcriptome studies with complex polyploid hybrid genomes and not completely sequenced, such as the one of sugarcane, remains a challenge. In such studies, a considerable set of reads may not align on any reference genome but still hold significant relevance to the study, allowing to gather information beyond the complex organism itself. Results: A complete transcriptome analysis of sugarcane inoculated with a pathogen, with and without the addition of a beneficial bacteria, generated a subset of reads that did not map to their respective genome references. Here, we report a pipeline based on the assembly of a collection of unmapped reads that potentially interfere with the gene expression of the associated microbiome, as well as the identification of long non-coding RNAs related to transposable elements present in a host-pathogen interaction. In addition, the detection of transcripts of naturally occurring microorganisms in sugarcane allowed the identification of its microbiome at the species level. Further studies support changes in microorganism transcription levels according to the biotic stress the plant was conditioned. Conclusion: A quick and practical pipeline is proposed to study unmapped reads to infer relevant information that would remain otherwise unnoticed. New sequences from hybrid sugarcane transcriptome, such as long non-coding genes related to known retrotransposons are described.

Rapaprotin, a novel macrocycle identified from a rapamycin-inspired rapafucin library, disrupts 26S proteasome function by inducing disassembly of the 19S regulatory particle in the 26S proteasome, leading to apoptosis in MM cells. Its bioactivation requires prolyl endopeptidase (PREP)-mediated cleavage to generate Rapaprotin-L, a negatively charged, linear metabolite with potent proteasome-disassembly activity. Using the PRISM cancer cell line profiling platform, we identified high P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) expression as a major determinant of Rapaprotin resistance in solid tumor cell lines. Efflux assays confirmed Rapaprotin-L, but not its parent Rapaprotin, as a high-affinity P-gp substrate. Co-treatment with the third-generation P-gp inhibitor tariquidar restored the intracellular accumulation of Rapaprotin-L, reinstating proteasome inhibition and consequent apoptosis of Rapaprotin-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines. Strong synergy between Rapaprotin and tariquidar was observed in a 3D spheroid model. These results establish P-gp as a key mediator of resistance to Rapaprotin and identify a rare example of a negatively charged Rapaprotin-L as a P-gp substrate.

However, sex has traditionally been neglected in the field of thermal ecology, and our understanding of the factors that promote sex differences in thermal plasticity is underdeveloped. Here, we investigate the independent and interactive effects of sex and reproductive condition on thermal acclimation capacity in a plethodontid salamander (Plethodon cinereus). We carried out two stop-flow respirometry experiments, with salamanders acclimated to one of two thermal environments designed to simulate a Cool or Warm breeding season. In the first experiment, we compared the thermal acclimation responses of males and gravid females across a gradient of three ecologically relevant test temperatures and observed distinct patterns of sexual dimorphism of standardized metabolic rate (SMR) between thermal treatments that were not attributable to differences in body size. Specifically, gravid females in the warm treatment showed reduced SMR relative to gravid females in the cool treatment, particularly at higher test temperatures. In the second experiment, we expanded on our initial findings by directly testing the contribution of reproductive condition to observed sex differences in thermal acclimation capacity. By repeating the experiment of the early breeding season but including a third group of non-gravid females, we: (1) recapitulated our original finding - that gravid females exhibit a pronounced response to thermal acclimation relative to males; and (2) showed that female thermal acclimation responses are absent in nongravid females, and therefore we concluded that responses are contingent on reproductive condition. Taken together, our results provide a first glimpse into how sex and reproductive condition contribute to intraspecific variation in thermal acclimation capacity in an amphibian and underscore the need for more hypothesis-driven studies to directly test when, where, and how such patterns arise.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate the power and versatility of this method by designing binders for four critical phosphotyrosine sites on three clinically relevant targets: Cluster of Differentiation 3 (CD3{varepsilon}), Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and Insulin Receptor (INSR). Experimental characterization shows that the designs bind their phospho-tyrosine containing targets with affinities comparable to native binding sites and have negligible binding to non-phosphorylated targets or phosphopeptides with different sequences. X-ray crystal structures of generated binders to CD3{varepsilon} and EGFR are very close to the design models, demonstrating the accuracy of the design approach.

Here, we develop i-Fold (importanceFold), an enhanced neural architecture enhances the AlphaFold2 architecture by integrating protein language model ESM-derived residue importance scores (RIS) as dynamic positional weights during training. Our approach dynamically weights amino acids using RIS during structure prediction, thereby directing computational attention toward functionally critical residues and regions. Evaluation on a benchmark test set of 3,559 protein structures reveals that i-Fold significantly improves accuracy (reduction in r.m.s.d., p=0) and achieves a higher prediction success rate (7.6% improvement: 55.1% [-&gt;] 62.7%). Notably, i-Fold demonstrates particular improvements for targets that are typically challenging for AlphaFold2, including ribosomal proteins, membrane proteins, and orphan proteins. Consistent results were obtained on a completely independent test set of 167 recently released protein structures, where i-Fold again exhibited a higher prediction success rate (6.0% improvement: 43.7% [-&gt;] 49.7%) compared to AlphaFold2.

We developed a novel three-stage, sequence-based modeling suite that progressively adds ligand conditioning and zero-shot capability, and used an evaluation framework to assess the suite. Stage 1 trains per-ligand predictors using a pretrained protein language model (PLM). Stage 2 introduces ligand-aware conditioning via an embedding table, enabling a single multi-ligand model. Stage 3 replaces the table with a pretrained chemical language model (CLM) operating on SMILES, enabling zero-shot generalization.

Many conditions that block transcription also block DNA replication, causing replication stress, and 7SK-snRNP components are putative tumour suppressors with roles in transcription-replication conflicts and double-strand break repair. Here, we investigate potential roles of 7SK-snRNP components in the response to replication stress induced by chemotherapy agents with and without additional impact on transcription. We report that HEXIM1 and LARP7 promote replication fork slowing in response to agents that cause both replication- and transcription stress, in a manner consistent with their canonical 7SK-snRNP functions. Our data suggest that this role in fork slowing is mainly through facilitating RAD51-mediated replication fork reversal rather than transcription-replication conflicts. HEXIM1 and LARP7 promote RAD51 recruitment to replication-associated DSBs or post-replicative gaps under conditions of transcription stress such as induced by camptothecin or BET inhibitors and support HR at direct DSBs. In contrast, HEXIM1 and LARP7 are not required for HR in response to hydroxyurea, which does not cause transcription stress. Our data support that LARP7 roles during replication stress are independent of its reported interaction with BRCA1, and that both LARP7 and HEXIM1 promote survival in response to replication stress-inducing agents. 7SK-snRNP components are not recruited to stressed replication forks and RNA polymerase II inhibition phenocopies loss of these proteins.

While PARP1 has been extensively studied in the context of DNA repair, emerging evidence implicates its catalytic activity in a broader set of cellular processes, including the regulation of gene expression. Here, we employed an NAD analog-sensitive PARP1 (asPARP1) chemical genetics approach combined with mass spectrometry to map the ADP-ribosylated proteome across six human breast cancer cell lines representing luminal and basal/triple negative subtypes. We identified thousands of PARP1 substrates and hundreds of Glu/Asp ADPRylation sites, revealing both shared and subtype-specific modifications in cell lines maintained under basal growth conditions. Luminal-specific substrates were enriched in chromatin and transcriptional regulators, whereas basal-specific substrates were preferentially linked to translation and RNA processing, highlighting lineage-dependent PARP1 activity. Transcription factors emerged as major substrates, with TFAP2A serving as a proof-of-concept; it is selectively ADPRylated in luminal cells and inhibition of PARP1-mediated ADPRylation modulates its promoter occupancy in a subtype-specific manner. Our data provide a new resource for studying subtype-specific PARP1-mediated ADPRylation in breast cancer cells.

The city was previously considered free of animal reservoirs other than owned and stray dogs within its urban boundaries. However, multiple reports from peri-urban residents have suggested the presence of feral dogs living in caves on the city's outskirts. We aim to document the presence and dietary patterns of feral dogs adjacent to the city margins. Methods: We conducted monthly field visits to four peri-urban localities in eastern Arequipa, an area where the presence of feral dogs had been previously reported. Dog caves were identified by tracking footprints and other field signs left by dogs, and their locations were georeferenced. Each cave was revisited monthly three times to record the presence of live and dead dogs, and puppies. Fecal samples collected around the caves were analyzed to assess dietary patterns. Results: We observed that feral dogs use caves for resting, hiding, and reproduction, some of which appear to be constructed by the dogs themselves. The high number of puppies and dead adult dogs indicates a high population turnover. Dietary analysis revealed that these dogs feed on local fauna, including birds, rodents, cats, sheep, and, notably, other dogs. Conclusions: These unowned, cave-dwelling dogs are not reached by mass rabies vaccination or sterilization programs. Moreover, they exist outside the jurisdiction of health inspectors responsible for rabies surveillance, resulting in a lack of data on rabies infection in this subpopulation.

Recent studies have highlighted PAC/SP3 as an ideal platform for chemoproteomics, allowing chemical labelling by minimizing sample loss and improving recovery of derivatized peptides. In this work, we establish an on-bead PAC/SP3 protein-level amine and carboxyl derivatization approach to facilitate C-terminal focused proteomics. We demonstrate that on-bead protein derivatization of carboxyl groups can be achieved using ethanolamine, (2-aminoethyl)trimethylammonium (AETMA), and (carboxymethyl)trimethylammonium (Girard's reagent T, GT) via EDC/HOBt coupling, enabling the labelling of protein C-termini. Using a prokaryotic model system, Acinetobacter baumannii, we demonstrate that AETMA and ethanolamine labelling each enables the identification of unique protein C-terminal peptides, with AETMA improving the identification of C-terminal peptides lacking basic residues. Finally, we apply this approach to interrogate both N- and C-termini in response to etoposide-induced apoptosis within Jurkat cells, demonstrating that combined N- and C-terminomics is achievable using on-bead derivatization, yet provides modest coverage of the C-terminome in its current form. Overall, this work establishes bead-based carboxyl group derivatization as a viable platform to enable future C-terminomics method development.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Device validity and versatility were evaluated via two synthetic microvessel specimen experiments: (I) comparison to an Instron stress-relaxation protocol, and (II) vessel segment length parametric analysis. A standard linear solid (SLS) model was chosen to fit the experimental results, from which the model coefficients (E1, E2, and ) and equilibrium modulus (Ge) were computed. Ge comparisons were made using Bland-Altman analysis and Welchs F-test for experiment I and II, respectively. Device feasibility was evaluated through testing human cadaveric cerebrovascular tissue. The SLS model provided accurate experimental data fits, with overall mean R2 value of 0.99 (SD= 2.4E-3). Ge for inflation-creep and Instron stress-relaxation experiments were statistically comparable, with Bland-Altman mean bias of 1.9% (95% CI: -0.9% - 4.6%, p=.18). Holistically, the vessel segment length parametric analysis revealed inconsistent values for Ge across the complete range of testing lengths, where ad hoc family-wise comparison indicated that the 0.5 cm length cohort was the singular outlier (p < .05). Our device successfully recorded a viscoelastic response from human cadaveric middle cerebral artery tissue (n=12).

Active stators dynamically exchange with a membrane pool in a load-dependent manner, with off-rates decreasing as motor load increases. Each stator comprises of MotA, which engages the rotor, and MotB, whose periplasmic domain anchors the complex to the peptidoglycan. But how external load regulates this anchoring remains unclear. Here, we show that long-range couplings within the Escherichia coli. MotB periplasmic domain regulate stator dynamics. Computational modeling revealed that the flexible loops believed to anchor the stator to the peptidoglycan and P-ring are dynamically coupled to distant residues. Coevolutionary analysis reinforced these couplings, highlighting conserved communication pathways within the domain. Guided by these predictions, we introduced point mutations at key sites and assayed motility of cells harboring these mutations. Most mutants remained motile but displayed distinct swimming phenotypes. In agreement with computational predictions, measurements of swimming speed at different stator expression levels showed that several mutations altered stator dynamics. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that variation in dynamic flexibility of the loops strongly correlates with the observed swimming speeds in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate that flexibility and long-range coupling within MotB tune stator anchoring, providing new insight into mechanosensitive remodeling of the flagellar motor.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Environmental monitoring revealed higher PM2.5 and associated benzo[]pyrene in UR, during winter, induced oxidative stress (elevated ROS, 8-OHdG), reduced antioxidants (SOD, catalase, GPx), and promoted airway inflammation.

To explore the functional and genetic relationships between G-fibers and twining stems of common bean, we applied an active brassinosteroid and a brassinosteroid inhibitor to perturb G-fiber development and probed these phenotypes through gene expression and anatomical analyses. Brassinosteroid treatment generated phenotypes that affected the three key features of twining: elongation, circumnutation, and G-fiber development. We examined anatomical and biochemical changes in the G-fibers through cross-sections, macerations, and immunohistochemistry. RNA sequencing and differential gene expression analysis allowed us to identify unique gene expression patterns for each treatment.Brassinosteroid treatment led to significantly elongated internodes with disrupted circumnutation and long, thin-walled G-fibers. In contrast, inhibitor treatment produced short internodes with thick G-fibers. These phenotypes corresponded with significant differential expression of XTH genes, both at the onset of elongation and later, during G-layer deposition. Detection of xyloglucan epitopes in the G-layer, along with in situ hybridization, confirmed active xyloglucan remodeling after twining.

The fossilized birth-death (FBD) process is a diversification model that incorporates both extant and extinct species, serving as a tree prior that seamlessly integrates fossils into phylogenetic inference. While the FBD model can account for mass extinctions, which caused rapid, widespread organismal loss, few studies have utilized FBD models incorporating these events in phylogenetic inference. This is likely because the detectability of mass extinctions and their impact on phylogenetic inference remain unclear. Through simulations, we assessed the influence of mass extinctions on divergence time and topology inference and evaluated the detectability of mass extinction signals in total-evidence dating. We examined three FBD tree priors: without mass extinction, with known mass extinction time and survival probability, and with known mass extinction time but unknown survival probability. Our results show that the FBD model with known mass extinction time and unknown survival probability was able to reliably detect mass extinctions when they occurred, and correctly refrained from detecting mass extinctions when they were absent. Moreover different FBD models generate similar divergence time and tree topology errors. Even when the FBD model used for tree inference did not explicitly account for mass extinction events, signals of mass extinction were still detectable on the resulting MCC trees. The accuracy of the detection was similar to the one obtained from MCC trees inferred using an FBD model that includes mass extinction parameters. We also reduced the fossilization rate and the number of morphological characters, obtaining results consistent with the aforementioned findings. However, reducing the fossilization rate decreased the accuracy of detecting mass extinctions when they occurred, and reducing the number of morphological characters decreased the accuracy of divergence time inference. Furthermore, we adjusted the priors for the existence of mass extinction and the survival probability of mass extinction. We found that the prior for the existence of mass extinction had no effect on inference, whereas the prior for the survival probability of mass extinction significantly influenced both the detection of mass extinctions and the estimation of survival probabilities. Finally, we applied these models to empirical datasets of tetraodontiform fishes and crinoids and found that, consistent with our simulation results, the inclusion of a mass extinction event in the tree prior had a negligible impact on the inferred topologies and divergence times.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

To directly address these questions, we measured the phenotypic effects of exposure to a predator cue in the water flea, Daphnia lumholtzi, which reproduces clonally allowing the isolation of the effects of direct environmental exposure from allelic variation. We measured the phenotypic effects of exposure to fish conditioned media in the F0, F3, F4, and F5 generations of genetically identical generations following cue exposure only in the F0 generation. We found evidence of predation induced morphologies into the F4 generation, with phenotypes receding in the F5 generation, four generations after cue removal.

Current therapies primarily focus on inhibiting hepatic Lp(a) production using RNA-based agents like antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., pelacarsen) or small interfering RNAs (e.g., olpasiran), achieving 80-98% reductions in phase 3 trials. However, these approaches overlook downstream clearance mechanisms, particularly the kidney's minor but established role in catabolizing apo(a) fragments through Kringle IV (KIV) domains. We propose a novel biologic therapeutic to amplify renal clearance by inducing targeted fragmentation of intact Lp(a) particles. The therapeutic is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) or bispecific antibody fused to a site-specific protease (e.g., inspired by ideS enzymes). It binds conserved KIV subtypes (e.g., KIV9 or KIV10) on apo(a), which mediate apo(a)-apoB100 disulfide linkage and prothrombotic fibrin binding. Upon binding, the protease cleaves apo(a) into smaller, non-atherogenic fragments (<100 kDa), mimicking natural urinary apo(a) excretion observed in healthy individuals. To enhance specificity, the conjugate incorporates pH-sensitive linkers for plasma activation and GalNAc moieties for partial hepatic targeting, minimizing off-target effects. Preclinical modeling (in silico and transgenic Lp(a) mouse models) would assess fragmentation efficiency, fragment safety, and clearance kinetics via glomerular filtration. Conceptual simulations suggest 50-70% acute Lp(a) reduction per dose, complementary to production inhibitors, with potential for biweekly subcutaneous administration. In chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients where Lp(a) levels rise due to impaired clearance this could prevent overload without nephrotoxicity. Unlike lipoprotein apheresis (60-80% reduction but invasive and rebound-prone), this offers scalable, patient-friendly therapy. Economic viability includes IP licensing and a companion diagnostic for KIV polymorphisms to predict response. This KIV-targeted fragmentation strategy represents a paradigm shift in Lp(a) management, leveraging underutilized renal pathways for enhanced clearance. If validated, it could reduce ASCVD events in high-risk populations, addressing gaps in current therapies.

A-PACE comprises three modules: (1) Change point detection for automated identification of peak regions; (2) Baseline fitting with multiple algorithms to handle diverse electrochemical signals and baseline screening to eliminate unreasonable fits; (3) Large dataset input with user-friendly interface for data processing, exporting and visualization. To ensure optimal performance, we curated a training set of 2000 electrochemical curves from an extensive electrochemical dataset (>100,000 curves) collected over the past five years under varied electrochemical measurement conditions.

Though existing attempts to model the cerebrovasculature confirm the potential of FSI as a future diagnostic tool, standard simulation methods and modeling parameters remain undefined. The purpose of this investigation was to compare immersed boundary (IB) and arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulations to discern whether the increased modeling complexity offered by ALE is necessary for the modeling of smaller-caliber vessels, given increased computational load. Methods: Direct comparisons of Fluent and Mechanical behavior were conducted between IB and ALE methods of FSI simulation. Simulations utilized an internal carotid artery geometry conduit with optimized mesh. Boundary constraints were derived from previous investigation of vascular tissue and fit to a Prony series. Both qualitative profile comparisons and quantitative parametric analyses of variance were conducted to assess differences in simulation output. Results: In this study, we report deviations in Fluent and Mechanical output between IB and ALE cases of FSI simulation. More specifically, ALE-method simulations boast higher stress, lower wall shear stress, and lower strain. These differences persist across the vessel geometry and increase with high strain. Additionally, inconsistencies between solving methods are exacerbated in areas of more complex mesh geometry (i.e. vessel bifurcation).

Normally, induction of autophagy is protective, although in some circumstances, such as conditions of hemodynamic stress, autophagosome accumulation upon autophagy induction can be a maladaptive process. The deficiency of the autophagic protease ATG4D in mice leads to the accumulation of cellular autophagosomes in most tissues, including the heart.

A hallmark of HFrEF is impaired cardiomyocyte contractility accompanied by disrupted mitochondrial bioenergetics; however, no current therapy targets both pathologies simultaneously. PERM1, a striated muscle-specific regulator of mitochondrial bioenergetics, is downregulated in HFrEF patients. We recently demonstrated that overexpression of PERM1 via adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9-PERM1) enhances both cardiac contractility and mitochondrial biogenesis in C57BL/6 mice. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of AAV9-PERM1 in a pressure overload-induced mouse model of HFrEF. C57BL/6 mice were treated with either AAV9-PERM1 or control AAV9-GFP (1 x 10^12 GC/mouse), followed by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery. At 4 weeks post-TAC, control mice receiving AAV-GFP exhibited reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), whereas AAV-PERM1 preserved LVEF at baseline levels. This cardioprotective effect was sustained through 8 weeks. Notably, AAV9-PERM1 completely abrogated TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. Mitochondrial analysis revealed that AAV9-PERM1 preserved mitochondrial DNA copy number and TFAM protein levels, both of which were reduced by TAC in control hearts. AAV9-PERM1 also improved mitochondrial respiration using pyruvate and octanoylcarnitine as substrates and prevented TAC-induced impairments in oxidative capacity. While PGC-1 expression remained unchanged in control TAC hearts, it was modestly yet significantly upregulated by AAV9-PERM1 in both sham and TAC groups. In addition, AAV9-PERM1 suppressed TAC-induced increases in O-GlcNAcylation, an stress-related posttranslational modification of proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation further revealed interactions of PERM1 with creatine kinase and troponin C, key proteins in ATP transduction and contractility, suggesting a functional coupling between mitochondrial energetics and contractility.

While this interpersonal synchronization has largely been associated with positive effects such as social bonding, some evidence suggests that it may also impair self-regulation and disrupt intrapersonal coordination. Because respiration and heart rhythms are weakly coupled within individuals, we investigated whether synchronizing breathing with another person alters intra-personal cardiorespiratory coupling. Across two experiments, participants synchronized their breathing reciprocally (bidirectional interaction), unidirectionally with a confederate, or with pre-recorded breathing signals, while respiration and electrocardiography (ECG) were continuously measured. Relative phase analyses revealed that bidirectional breathing synchronization induced in-phase synchronization of heart rhythms between individuals. Critically, interpersonal synchronization coincided with cardiorespiratory decoupling: respiration and heart rhythms became more out of phase during interaction compared to resting baselines and the unidirectional condition. Moreover, stronger interpersonal respiratory synchronization predicted greater intra-personal cardiorespiratory decoupling. These findings provide the first evidence that interpersonal physiological synchronization entails a trade-off with intrapersonal physiological coupling, perturbing the phase relationship within one's own physiological system. We propose that aligning one's physiological rhythms with others strengthens self-other coupling but weakens intrapersonal coupling, pointing to a physiological mechanism of self-decoupling during social interaction.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

In this study we identify the Arabidopsis HEAT SHOCK FACTOR A1 (HSFA1) class of transcription factors, being key regulators of the heat stress response, as central players in wound-induced callus formation and shoot regeneration. Loss of HSFA1 function in the hsfa1abd triple mutants severely impairs cellular reprogramming, reducing callus formation from wounded hypocotyls, as well as shoot regeneration from explants. Conversely, overexpression of the HSFA1d gain-of-function variant markedly enhances regeneration. Time-series RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that HSFA1s directly activate the key reprogramming regulators WOUND-INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION 1 (WIND1), PLETHORA 3 (PLT3) and ZINC FINGER OF ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA 6 (ZAT6). Furthermore, we demonstrate that HSFA1d activity is attenuated by SIZ1-mediated SUMOylation, linking post-translational modification to the regulation of wound responses. Our findings establish HSFA1s as an early transcriptional hub that integrates wound signals with the activation of a broad gene network that drives cellular reprogramming, thereby providing a mechanistic framework for understanding how stress-responsive transcription factors control regeneration.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

SWEETs (SUGARS WILL EVENTUALLY BE EXPORTED TRANSPORTER) are involved in transporting various kinds of sugars in plants; however, their functional roles in fungal symbiosis are not sufficiently explored. In this study, we investigate the functional relevance of Arabidopsis SWEETs in the interaction with endophytic fungi, Serendipita indica. Transcript profiling of SWEET genes in response to S. indica and its major elicitor, cellotriose, revealed early root-specific induction of SWEET12. Using a SWEET12 loss-of-function mutant, we demonstrate that the absence of SWEET12 disrupts the major outcomes of mutualism including growth promotion, balanced colonization, sugar allocation, and the accumulation of defense phytohormones (JA and SA). Transcriptome profiling further reveals that SWEET12 buffers whole-plant responses by coordinating genes linked to carbohydrate, nitrogen, and lipid metabolism, and by tuning defense signalling and nutrient transporter networks. Our findings indicate that SWEET12 is essential for balancing fungal colonization and host defense, thereby promoting plant growth. SWEET12 does so by acting as sugar valve that meters sugar release to the apoplast, enabling the fungus to access carbon while preserving host sugar homeostasis and immune competence.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms remain largely obscure, particularly in the context of the post-transcriptional regulations, where microRNAs (miRNAs) suppress the expression of multiple genes. Bulk transcriptomic data often blur these effects, especially when regulatory patterns vary by sex or cell type. miRNAs have emerged as key regulators of PD-related processes, but their complexity demands computational methods that enable capturing the functional impact at the pathway level. In this study, we investigated how sex may affect miRNA-regulated PD pathways using Boolean modeling across two large PD cohorts, the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) and the Luxembourg Parkinson Study (LuxPark). First, differential expression analysis identified significant variations in miRNA expression between the sexes across both cohorts. These miRNAs were analysed to identify molecular pathways that are over-represented among the predicted targets of the dysregulated microRNAs (i.e. enrichment analysis). The enriched pathways were used to build Boolean models to simulate the effects of sex-specific miRNA dysregulation. These simulations showed consistent male-specific impairment in mitochondrial biogenesis, and respiratory chain activity. Mitophagy and oxidative stress response pathways were also disrupted, alongside dysregulation of autophagy-related protein-folding mechanisms. Our findings suggest that sex-specific miRNA dysregulation contributes to differences in molecular patterns in PD by influencing compensatory related pathways and responses.

Tissue microenvironments dictate changes in neutrophil cell states in infection and cancer, but little is known about how alloimmune responses or solid organ transplantation influence neutrophil heterogeneity and plasticity. Methods: Here, we used the murine heterotopic heart transplant model in conjunction with high dimensional flow cytometry and transcriptome analysis to interrogate how the alloimmune response and microenvironment of a transplanted organ influence neutrophil subset differentiation and plasticity. Complete MHC mismatched A/J (H2a) or syngeneic B6 (H2b) hearts were transplanted to C57BL/6 or B6 background genetically modified recipients. Results: We uncovered striking differences between neutrophils infiltrating complete MHC mismatched allografts and syngeneic isografts. Bone marrow neutrophil development was highly skewed towards an immature, interferon stimulated gene (ISG)+ subset (marked by IFIT1 expression) early after transplant in both allo- and iso-graft recipients. ISG+ neutrophils were also the dominant population in the peripheral blood of both recipient groups. In contrast, neutrophils maintained the ISG+ phenotype after infiltrating an allograft but appeared to turn off this program upon infiltrating an isograft. The heart graft microenvironment imposed additional reprogramming independent of donor-recipient mismatch, as neutrophils from both allo- and iso-grafts were skewed towards a mature, aged and proangiogenic dcTRAIL-R1+ phenotype. Interestingly, while the existing literature indicates that IFIT1-expressing ISG+ neutrophils and proangiogenic dcTRAIL-R1+ neutrophils are distinct subsets, we identified a novel IFIT1+ dcTRAIL-R1+ hybrid population that is highly enriched in allografts. Mechanistically, NK cell-mediated innate allorecognition drives this early intra-allograft specific neutrophil phenotypic programing. Conclusions: These findings provide novel insights into the innate immune allorecognition-mediated regulation of the plasticity of recently described key neutrophil subsets and will enable specific targeting to neutralize detrimental neutrophil subsets and enhance solid organ transplant outcomes.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

In this setting, each lineage has a relative propensity to coalesce, with coalescent odds ratios defined from the product of pairwise propensities. Estimated coalescent odds provide a statistic that captures variation in lineage growth and are informative about the strength of natural selection acting on individual lineages. A number of practical statistical methods are then developed: techniques to adjust for biased and non-uniform sampling; procedures to automatically calibrate hyperparameters governing the evolution of coalescent propensity; and, methods for clustering phylogenies into sets that delineate clades according to coalescent propensity. Simulations show sensitivity of these methods to detecting small selective effects acting on rare variants, and strong robustness to imbalanced sampling.

Snails were raised in groups on fresh lettuce (FL), fish food (FF) and artificial snail gel (SG) diet for eight weeks, while measuring dietary impacts on growth, survival, and fecundity. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed to correlate dietary phenotypes with changes in the snail transcriptome and associated microbial metatranscriptome. Relative to FL, FF and SG diets markedly enhanced growth, survival, and fecundity, with FF generating the highest fecundity rate. RNA-Seq identified 21,887 nutritionally modulated genes in the snail transcriptome. Fish food (FF) and SG diets drove upregulation of genes associated with antimicrobial immunity, growth, and reproduction, while elevated expression of genes linked to xenobiotic metabolism and oxidative stress was observed in FL-fed snails. Metatranscriptomic analysis identified 104 microbial classes, with a total of twenty-three classes significantly enriched in FF and SG snails, including short-chain fatty acid-producing and nutrient-cycling bacteria. Significant correlation (r = 0.63, p = 0.001) linked differentially expressed genes with enriched microbial taxa, highlighting the impact of diet on key snail health and performance metrics.

Inhibitor development suffered from the fact that inhibitors against the hydrophobic pocket of PDE6D were typically poorly water-soluble. Here we describe the development of genetically encoded inhibitors that are inspired by high-affinity natural cargo of PDE6D. Our most potent inhibitor, SNAP-STI, encodes merely a farnesylated tetra-peptide, which efficiently blocks PDE6D binding of farnesylated cargo. Direct comparison with small molecule PDE6D inhibitors suggests its higher potency. We show that inhibition of K-Ras membrane anchorage and K-RasG12C-dependent MAPK-signaling by SNAP-STI is weak, consistent with what is observed after PDE6D knockdown. Our data therefore further support that PDE6D is not a suitable surrogate target for efficient inhibition of K-Ras membrane anchorage and MAPK-activity. Nonetheless, by exploiting contacts at the pocket entry, we established a generalizable strategy to design high-affinity PDE6D inhibitors, providing powerful tools for PDE6D biology and target validation.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Blocking DC migration in fast-relaxing gels recapitulated key aspects of the impaired T cell priming seen in elastic matrices.

The potential ways in which humans may be exposed to microplastic include ingestion, inhalation, or dermal contact. To facilitate initial estimates of the potential for human exposure, a model has been developed that incorporates all of the major stages in the transfer of microplastic from its sources to direct human contact. Due to the scarcity of data available, a simplified gradation of exposure probability has been applied. Building on the results of published mass flow models for microplastics, the model is based on normalized values for the release of microplastics from different types of applications into environmental compartments, also considering the degradation of macroplastic. Published data investigating the contamination of different foods and beverages are evaluated, and the inhalation probability is assessed using air pollution data and breathing rates.

Quick-release and step-ramp experiments are commonly used to estimate these properties. The accuracy of these methods is unclear, as the actual values of these properties are unknown in experiments on real muscle. We conducted a modelling study using a Hill-type muscle-tendon complex model with literature-derived parameter values and simulated quick-release, step-ramp, and isometric experiments. From the simulated experiments, we assessed how accurately the model's parameter values could be retrieved. Using a method traditionally used in literature, the series elastic element stiffness was underestimated by ~35%, due to the incorrect assumption that muscle fibres do not shorten during quick releases. Consequently, this yielded an overestimation of the excitation dynamics activation time constants of ~20%. We developed an improved method that accounted for muscle fibre length shortening during quick releases. Using our improved method, all parameter values closely matched their actual values. A sensitivity analysis showed that the most critical parameters were robust to perturbations in experimental data. Lastly, we compared Hill-type MTC model predictions against in situ data from three rat m. gastrocnemius medialis muscles. Predictions based on parameters from the improved method showed closer agreement than those based on the traditional method -- both for quick-release, step-ramp, and isometric experiments, as well as for independent stretch-shortening cycles.

Syntaxin1A is localized on the cytosolic face of the presynaptic membrane and with Munc-18-1 is thought to be the starting point for the SNARE complex assembly. In flies, aspartic-to-arginine amino acid substitution at position 253 of the protein sequence reduces synaptic release by affecting the assembly of multiple SNARE complexes into a super-complex without interfering with the single complex formation per se. In this study, we analyzed sleep behavior in flies expressing this mutated isoform of Syntaxin1A pan-neuronally. According to the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis, the overall decrease of synaptic activity during the previous period of wakefulness should reduce the need for sleep. We observed a reduction in the total amount of sleep in flies expressing the mutated isoform compared to controls. Moreover, the sleep pattern of the Syntaxina1A mutant flies was more fragmented compared to controls. Video-tracking analysis of free walking flies in an open-field arena showed that these changes were not caused by higher locomotor activity during the daytime relative to controls.

We found that isoflurane anesthesia significantly shifts the preferred SFs of excitatory neurons to lower values. This downward shift was even more pronounced in inhibitory neurons. These downshifts selectively impaired the neural coding of high-SF information while leaving low-SF coding unaffected. We observed distinct patterns of anesthesia-induced downward shifts of preferred SFs between two major cortical inhibitory neuron subtypes: somatostatin-expressing (SOM) and parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons. Furthermore, anesthesia-induced changes in response gain and tuning sharpness were evident in SOM neurons but not in PV neurons. These results highlight the diverse effects of anesthesia on sensory responses, varying significantly based on both the visual feature processed and the specific neuron subtype involved. The consistent decrease in preferred SFs during anesthesia not only suggests a potential mechanism for anesthesia-induced alterations in sensory experience but also emphasizes the critical role of heightened SF preference during wakefulness for fine object perception.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have uncovered roles for different Nups in processes like cellular differentiation, contributing richly to organismal development. Intriguingly, the Nup107 complex member, Nup43, is linked with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in humans. We report that Nup43 is integral to the maintenance of Drosophila fertility. Nup43 null mutant (Nup43KO) generated by CRISPR-Ca9 causes sterility in both females and males. While oocyte development is halted at the first division stage, the Nup43KO males are sterile due to defective spermatogenesis, which is arrested at the canoe stage of development in Nup43KO mutants. The nuclear elongation, shaping, and actin cone formation steps of individualization complex (IC) formation are adversely affected, suspending sperm maturation. All these defects were rescued by the expression of the Nup43 transgene in null mutants, suggesting the criticality of Nup43 function in spermatogenesis. Myosin VI (jar), an actin cone modulator, and Nup43 interactor can partially rescue the actin cone formation but not the sterility defects. We propose that Nup43 facilitates sperm individualization along with jar by promoting actin cone formation during spermatogenesis. These observations uncover a novel yet critical function for Nup43 in Drosophila gonad development and spermatogenesis.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

A target-specific bait dispenser is required for oral bait vaccination of the endangered Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) against the devil facial tumour disease. Development of a dispenser that can be extended to other species would be a beneficial conservation tool. A camera-based edge device with an onboard deep learning model can be used to identify the target species using image classification. 2. It is important to choose a suitable edge device for the dispenser's effective application in power constrained environments. In this study, we evaluated four edge devices for the smart bait dispenser-- ArduinoPro Nicla Vision, ArduinoPro Portenta H7 with Vision Shield (LoRa), Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W. Two simple convolutional neural networks (CNN1 and 2), and four fine-tuned pretrained models (MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3Small, ResNet50V2, and ResNet152V2) were trained on trail camera images of devil and non-devil species. These models were evaluated across four metrics and post-training quantised for deployment. The edge devices were assessed on inference latency of each model in seconds (s) and power consumption in watt (W). 3. We found that a simple CNN based image classification model yielded the best overall result of {approx}96% across all metrics. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W could run all the six models whereas Portenta failed to run the two ResNet models and Nicla Vision failed to run all four fine-tuned pretrained models. All edge devices were found to be quick enough for dispenser application (average inference latency of 0.718 s). Portenta consumed the lowest power during inference (0.19 W), idle (0.185 W), and light sleep (0.045 W) states whereas Nicla Vision consumed the lowest power during deep sleep state (0.002 W). 4. Overall, we conclude that a simple CNN image classifier, CNN1, deployed on Portenta is the most suitable edgeAI application for a smart bait dispenser. We suggest integration of this system with a sleep-mode efficient microcontroller unit like ATtiny85 for multiday field application. This method can be readily adapted for other species, such as eastern quoll and racoons, for projects like supplemental feeding and vaccination.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Soil samples were collected from long-term experimental plots of the Global Change Experimental Facility (GCEF, Germany) and used to extract microbial communities, which were then used to inoculate sterilized potting soil in which two wheat cultivars, drought sensitive Nordkap and drought-tolerant SU Fiete, were grown under controlled greenhouse drought. Our results showed that microbial inoculation enhanced germination relative to non-inoculated, with conventional_ambient microbiomes most strongly promoting emergence, while organic_future microbiomes suppressed seed germination. Under drought, aboveground fresh biomass and dry weight content diverged by interaction between cultivar and microbial legacy in such a way that Nordkap performed best with future-climate microbiomes, whereas SU Fiete benefited from ambient-climate microbiomes. The rhizosphere of plants inoculated with organic-derived microbes harbored a larger unique ASVs, with 442 bacterial and 70 fungal ASVs, compared with 381 bacterial and 48 fungal ASVs unique to conventional_derived microbes. We further showed that rhizosphere bacterial communities were influenced by complex interactions between microbial history (farming and climate), cultivar, and water stress, while fungal communities tracked only farming history, with organic legacies buffering fungal diversity under drought.

However, direct field measurements are costly and time-consuming. Developing accurate and unbiased height-diameter allometries applicable over large spatial scales is therefore crucial for forest research and management. Based on the French National Forest Inventory, with 269,976 tree-height observations on 49,234 plots measured, we developed generalized, species-specific height-diameter allometries that integrate stand dendrometrical characteristics and stand structure. The models cover 42 European tree species and the four main stand structures: even-aged, uneven-aged, coppice-with-standards and coppice. To enhance local accuracy, we developed an optional recalibration method at the plot level, assessing how many additional trees should be measured and which ones to select to maximize the improvement of the model. By integrating basal area as stand density and quadratic mean diameter as an indicator of stand development stage, our models enable us to assess the influence stand dendrometrical characteristics on these allometries and evaluate how different species responded to competition. Results indicate that with increasing competition, tree height tends to be higher for a given diameter, and that stand structure significantly influences 30 out of the 42 species. Local recalibration showed that measuring just one to six of the largest trees per plot reduced prediction error by 20 to 70%, depending on species. This study provides a useful, robust and scalable tool for forest research and management, for the most widespread species in Europe, while offering precision for local applications.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Some fungal NLRs are known to control regulated cell death (RCD) in the context of allorecognition, the capacity to recognize conspecific nonself. However, the function of most fungal NLR genes remains unknown. Here, we characterize the evolution of the NLR repertoire in the Podospora anserina species complex. We show that the vast majority of the NLRs display effector domains known to be involved in RCD execution. Moreover, NLRs undergo more rapid gene turnover than random genes, show higher dN/dS values, and faster evolutionary rates. A subgroup of NLRs, distinguished by superstructure-forming repeats with very high sequence identity (high internal conservation, HIC), evolved independently multiple times. We found that HIC NLRs are more associated with transposable elements, exhibit higher nucleotide diversity partially driven by repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), and show elevated Tajima's D values indicative of balancing selection. Furthermore, HIC NLR phylogenies do not recapitulate species relationships, which we determined is caused by both balancing selection and introgression. In addition, we identified cases of repeat exchange between distinct HIC NLR genes, implying that novel binding specificities may evolve through repeat shuffling, thereby increasing allelic diversity. Finally, we determined that NLR-like genes with HIC repeats exist outside of the fungal realm, arguing for similar dynamics in other taxa. Overall, these findings suggest that fungal NLRs evolve under diversity-enhancing mechanisms and display selective signatures consistent with a general immune function.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

VRJS triggers multiple congenital anomalies, but the underlying pathomechanisms remain poorly understood. Mutation of the Caenorhabditis elegans PUF60 ortholog, rnp-6, recapitulates several hallmarks of VRJS, including growth delay and smaller body size. Here, we demonstrate that developmental defects in rnp-6 mutants are rescued by dietary K12-type Escherichia coli strains. Through complementary genetic screens and multi-omics analyses, we identify vitamin B12 (VB12) as a potent suppressor of these defects, acting via the methionine/S-adenosylmethionine/phosphatidylcholine metabolic axis. Mechanistically, rnp-6 mutation causes aberrant splicing with methionine and phospholipid metabolism-related genes, which cumulatively impair cellular methylation potential, dysregulate phosphatidylcholine metabolism, and induce integrated stress response. We identify intron retention of the nhr-114/HNF4 transcription factor as a primary driver of growth defects, and restoring its splicing robustly suppresses these phenotypes. VB12 supplementation bypasses the aberrant splicing, restores metabolic balance, and activates mTORC1 to rescue developmental phenotypes. Finally, we show that PUF60 deficiency induces aberrant splicing of methionine and phospholipid metabolism-related genes in a human cell line, and is associated with altered plasma methionine and phospholipid levels in VRJS patients. Our findings establish C. elegans as a tractable model for VRJS and uncover SAM/SAH/phospholipid dysregulation as a key mechanism underlying the spliceosomopathy, suggesting VB12 as a potential strategy to mitigate VRJS-related anomalies.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

To address this limitation, we introduce conditional differential gene expression (CDGE) analysis, a framework designed to identify direct effect genes. Direct effect genes are those whose changes in expression causally and directly impact downstream biological processes of interest. In applications to three RNA sequencing datasets (including one genome-scale perturb-seq dataset), CDGE analysis identifies that only a small fraction of differentially expressed genes has direct effects and mediate most other gene actions.

In this report, we identify potential Notch inhibitors, using a novel cell-based Notch reporter system for unbiased screening of compounds reducing Notch signalling. A library of 37.966 small organic compounds was screened for inhibitor candidates, followed by a counter screen to eliminate y-secretase inhibitor-like compounds and an orthogonal screen based on the role of Notch signalling in myogenic differentiation. This triage led to the identification of five Notch inhibitor candidate hits with different chemical backbones and unrelated to previous Notch antagonists. One candidate hit showed structural similarities to dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors, and we provide evidence that inhibition of DHODH activity reduces Notch signalling.

Accordingly, we performed untargeted proteomics of ventricular myocardium from patients with ATTR-CM versus controls. Methods: Myocardial tissue from non-failing (NF) controls (n=7) and ATTR-CM (n=4) were assayed by mass spectrometry. HFrEF, HCM, and HFpEF proteomics were acquired from published databases.

Gene ontology pathway analysis found that downregulated proteins were enriched for oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial protein translation pathways, while upregulated proteins were enriched for enhanced endocytosis and intracellular vesicle mediated transport. The latter is not observed in other forms of heart failure. We further identify a profound downregulation of sarcomere protein content, which is also not seen in other cardiomyopathies.

We applied collinearization to Kluyveromyces marxianus, a yeast species that is both distantly related to and has a distinct genome structure from the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We generated a ~35-kb K. marxianus DNA segment that was collinear with one-sixth of a S. cerevisiae chromosome and contained 17 protein-coding genes. Although this synthetic chromosome segment successfully substituted for its native counterpart in an S. cerevisiae cell, it imposed a significant growth cost due to the incompatibility of two K. marxianus proteins with the host proteome. We predicted the disrupted protein-protein interactions using AlphaFold and alleviated their cost by supplementing orthologous protein partners from K. marxianus. Furthermore, we completely eliminated the growth cost by replacing the two incompatible K. marxianus genes with their S. cerevisiae orthologs. These findings demonstrate that collinearization can facilitate the creation of chimeric genomes to dissect the genetic basis of incompatibility and traits between organisms that cannot naturally hybridize.

Inflammasome signalling drives local inflammation and systemic responses like fever. However, our understanding of how inflammasome signalling is negatively regulated is limited. NLRP3 is activated by a vast number of stimuli and senses perturbations of cytoplasmic homeostasis. As temperature is a fundamental environmental stressor, we hypothesised that NLRP3 inflammasome signalling would be sensitive to increased temperatures and so we investigated the effects of high temperatures on NLRP3 in macrophages. Short-term incubation at high fever range temperatures significantly inhibits NLRP3 activation, while secretion of the inflammasome-independent cytokines TNF and IL-6 are much less affected. High temperature blocks NLRP3 inflammasome formation in a transcription-independent manner, and NLRP3 is highly sensitive to temperature-mediated inhibition relative to the NLRC4, AIM2, and NLRP1 inflammasomes. Using cellular assays and molecular simulations we show that the effect of high temperature on NLRP3 is protein intrinsic. NLRP3 activation is associated with a decrease in the thermal stability of the protein and multiscale molecular dynamics simulations identified a peptide in the C-terminal of the FISNA domain (COFI) that is highly flexible and undergoes a significant conformational shift at high temperature. Cellular assays demonstrate that the COFI regulates NLRP3 stability and is required for activation. Furthermore, mice exposed to high temperature display attenuated inflammatory cytokine production upon in vivo LPS challenge. Our studies thus reveal that high temperatures associated with fever limit NLRP3 activity and identify a novel role for NLRP3 as a protein thermosensor.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Notably, rapid dissemination of various E. coli sequence types (STs) with CTX-M-1 was observed, with ST11138 rapidly outcompeting other strains, including the initially dominant ST11893. Genomic analyses revealed that ST11138 harboured F24:A-:B1 and IncI1/ST3/CTX-M-1 plasmids encoding colicins and corresponding immunity genes, likely conferring a competitive advantage. Our findings underscore the role of bacteriocin-mediated interactions in shaping microbial communities and highlight the importance of plasmid-encoded traits in the persistence of resistant strains in wildlife. Importantly, our findings underscore the ecological novelty of longitudinal in vivo tracking of AMR persistence in natural hosts and highlight the need to consider ecological and microbiome-level interactions when assessing the environmental dimension of AMR under the One Health concept.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

However, defining universal criteria to distinguish healthy from altered microbiome configurations remains challenging due to inter- and intra-individual variability, database-dependent approaches, and the complexity of analyzing numerous microbial features simultaneously. Here, we developed an approach that learns the syntax of the entire DNA of human microbial communities, using Sequence-Informed GC-normalized 4-mers (SIG-mers) that feed into statistical and machine learning frameworks. We identified distinct SIG-mer signatures that differentiate microbiomes of body sites across diverse healthy human populations. These signatures reveal both global microbiome shifts and individual-specific dynamics in response to antibiotic treatments and in chronic inflammatory disease. Leveraging machine learning models, we inferred health- and disease-associated microbiome states from SIG-mer profiles, capturing the degree of perturbation and disease severity. Our findings highlight SIG-mer profiling as a robust, unbiased and broadly applicable approach for personalized microbiome diagnostics and guiding therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

These associations involve several and diverse species, each evolving on different timescales. Understanding these interactions requires approaches that integrate both the ecological dynamics and evolutionary processes, which drive the adaptation of plants and microorganisms. We investigated bacterial community assembly dynamics associated with four diverse Pisum spp. accessions grown in greenhouse conditions on soil. Bacterial DNA was extracted from bulk soil, rhizosphere, rhizoplane, and endosphere microhabitats across three plant growth stages, followed by full-length 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacterial communities varied in diversity, composition and structure across microhabitats and growth stages. Ecophylogenetic analyses indicated strong plant-induced ecological filtering, with community assembly across space and time structured by phylogenetic constraints. This illustrates the role of plant-defined ecological niches in shaping bacterial communities, where selective recruitment favors specific and closely related lineages. Our findings suggest that an ecophylogenetic framework provides valuable insights into plant-microbiota dynamics by integrating ecological and evolutionary processes, thereby offering a powerful perspective to investigate the co-adaptation of plants and their associated microbiota.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Farmed salmon exhibits reduced microbial diversity and distinct community composition with increased Firmicutes and reduced Proteobacteria compared to wild salmon. Microbial diversity declined with advancing developmental phases notably due to reduced Proteobacteria and expanded Mycoplasma.

Using proteomic analysis and confocal microscopy, we identified 230 L-CK1.2-associated proteins (L-CKAPs) across the parasite life stages, promastigotes, which replicate within the insect vector, and amastigotes, which proliferate inside the phagolysosomes of host macrophages. This analysis revealed the ubiquitous presence of L-CK1.2 within various cellular structures, including the cytoskeleton, basal body, and flagellum.

Current therapeutic approaches rely on mechanical debridement and antimicrobials, which face limitations including antibiotic resistance and microbiome disruption. Pathoblockers represent a novel therapeutic strategy that selectively targets virulence factors without bactericidal effects, potentially reducing resistance development while preserving beneficial microbiota. Here, we describe the characterization of S-0636, a novel reversible inhibitor of zinc-dependent glutaminyl cyclase (PgQC), as a compound to selectively suppress growth of P. gingivalis. The compound s effects was assessed through enzymatic assays, bacterial growth studies, virulence factor activity measurements (gingipain activity, hemagglutination, keratinocyte invasion), selectivity testing against commensal oral bacteria, resistance development analysis over 50 passages, and cytotoxicity evaluation in human cell lines. S-0636 demonstrated potent PgQC inhibition with a Ki value of 0.014 M and has successfully reduced the intracellular PgQC activity by 50% at 8 M and had no bactericidal effects. Treatment of P. gingivalis with S-0636 significantly decreased gingipain activity, impaired hemagglutination capacity, and reduced keratinocyte invasion by 76% at 62.5 M. The compound showed high selectivity, with no growth inhibition of ten tested oral commensal species at concentrations up to 0.25 mM. Importantly, no resistance development was observed after 50 bacterial passages, and cytotoxicity remained minimal in human cell lines with >80% viability at 0.5 mM. In previous studies, PgQC was suggested as an enzyme responsible for pGlu-modification and stabilization of bacterial virulence factors. The current study now validates PgQC as an attractive target for pathoblocker development, demonstrating that S-0636 effectively attenuates P. gingivalis pathogenicity through selective virulence factor inhibition while preserving bacterial viability and oral microbiome integrity.

Alterations in microbial composition, known as dysbiosis, are observed in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), and gastrointestinal infections; however, the exact causal relationship between these changes and the resolution of intestinal inflammation and the repair of damaged mucosa remains unclear. Notably, IBD is not only marked by dysbiosis but also by changes in microbial metabolic pathways and metabolite landscape in the intestinal lumen. The small molecules and microbial metabolites present in the intestinal lumen have emerged as potential regulators of gut pathology, cancer, and mucosal repair. Investigating how altered microbiota and microbial metabolic activities influence intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) can provide insights into their role in the regeneration of mucosal epithelia and restoration of gut barrier functions. This knowledge can be harnessed to promote intestinal homeostasis, prevent relapse, and prolong remission of IBD. To dissect the complex interplay between the gut microbiome and IEC, we focused on the overrepresented bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Here, we show that B. thetaiotaomicron and Akkermansia muciniphila, the dominant members of gut microbiota, expand during the repair & resolution phase of the chemically induced acute murine colitis. Furthermore, our bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that the elevated relative abundance of B. thetaiotamicron was also accompanied by rewiring of bacterial metabolic programs towards the essential amino acid metabolism, polyamine synthesis and utilization, stress response mechanisms, cell envelope biogenesis, and nutrient scavenging. Our RNA sequencing and transcriptomic analysis of primary human colonic epithelial cells cocultured with B. thetaiotaomicron showed that B. thetaiotaomicron stimulates the expression of genes and pathways involved in different cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, lipid metabolism, migration, chemotaxis, and receptor expression. Our study emphasizes the crucial functions of the gut microbiome and metabolic activities in regulating the functions of intestinal epithelial cells during the repair of injured gut mucosa.

During infection, eukaryotic IF4F on host ribosomes is replaced by an essential viral IF4F that regulates viral translation, virion formation, and replication plasticity during altered host states. Structural dissection of viral IF4F reveals that the mRNA cap-binding subunit mediates exclusive interactions with viral mRNAs, constituting a molecular switch from translating host to viral proteins.

While it is known that tight regulation of translation is vital for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) biology, the mechanisms underlying translation regulation across the hematopoietic system remain obscure. Here we reveal a novel mechanism of translation regulation in the hematopoietic hierarchy, which is mediated by ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methylation dynamics. Using ultra-low input ribosome-profiling, we characterized cell-type-specific translation capacity during erythroid differentiation. We found that translation efficiency changes progressively with differentiation and can distinguish between discrete cell populations as well as to define differentiation trajectories. To reveal the underlying mechanism, we performed comprehensive mapping of the most abundant rRNA modification - 2-O-methyl (2OMe). We found that, like translation efficiency, 2OMe dynamics followed a distinct trajectory during erythroid differentiation. Genetic perturbation of individual 2OMe sites demonstrated their distinct roles in modulating proliferation and differentiation. By combining CRISPR screening, molecular and functional analyses, we identified a specific methylation site, 28S-Gm4588, which is progressively lost during differentiation, as a key regulator of HSC self-renewal. We showed that low methylation at this site led to translational skewing, mediated mainly by codon frequency, which promoted differentiation. Functionally, HSCs with diminished 28S-Gm4588 methylation exhibited impaired self-renewal capacity ex-vivo, and loss of fitness in-vivo in bone marrow transplantations. Extending our findings beyond the hematopoietic system, we also found distinct dynamics of 2OMe profiles during differentiation of non-hematopoietic stem cells.

Using overexpression approaches, we show here that Traf4 promotes JNK and caspase activation, as well as junctional E-Cadherin/ {beta}-Catenin depletion, resulting in epithelial cell delamination. Using biochemical, modelling, and functional genetics approaches, we further show that the Bearded-type small protein E(spl)m4 binds to Traf4, and inhibits its downstream signalling towards JNK activation and cell delamination, without affecting the effects of Traf4 on Adherens Junctions.

Using a 10-year dataset on the occurrence of 11 bird species across a 600 km2 study area, we evaluated how spring snowmelt timing and predator density influence species occurrence and community structure in the High Arctic tundra. We found that species occurrence declined with later snowmelt dates, with larger-bodied species being particularly constrained by short snow-free periods. Predation further modulated species occurrence, with responses varying according to body mass. Our findings highlight the combined influence of the phenology of food availability and predation as fundamental ecological filters shaping community structure.

We investigated methanogenic colonization across 16 upland forest tree species and evaluated relationships between microbial communities and emissions. Methods: We measured 1,148 stem fluxes and 276 soil fluxes, quantified methanogens and methanotrophs via droplet digital PCR in 564 samples, characterized communities through 16S rRNA sequencing, and developed models to upscale fluxes ecosystem-wide. Key results: Methanogens were detected in 97% of heartwood samples (up to 10^7; copies per gram), exceeding mean soil abundances by ~2 orders of magnitude. Wood harbored distinct methanogenic communities (Methanobacteriaceae, Methanomassiliicoccaceae) compared to soils. Species-level methanogen abundance correlated with emissions (R-squared = 0.40), though individual-level correlations were weak, reflecting spatial heterogeneity and complex metabolism and transport interactions. Main conclusion: Methanogens are common in tree microbiomes across diverse species, concentrated in heartwood with substantial individual variation. Species-level abundance patterns partially explain emission variability, establishing internal production as a widespread contributor to upland tree fluxes. Future multi-omics approaches could strengthen abundance-flux relationships, while resolving ecosystem-scale importance requires improved quantification of canopy surface area and flux variability.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

In most organisms the Translocon consists of three subunits, TatA, TatB and TatC exhibiting a stoichiometry of ~20-50/1/1. While TatB/TatC recognize the canonical twin-arginine motif-containing signal sequence of substrate proteins, TatA has been hypothesized to interact with TatB/TatC and translocon substrates facilitating their transport across the membrane. TatA from E.coli contains a short transmembrane helix near the N-terminus, a longer amphipathic helix and a relatively large unstructured C-terminal domain. While the transmembrane and amphipathic helixes are required for Translocon activity, the C-terminal domain is, in large measure, dispensable. TatA has been hypothesized to form higher-order oligomers in the biological membranes. In this communication we have used 1000 ns-long course-grained molecular dynamic simulations to examine the interactions between a membrane-associated E. coli TatA nonamer, alone, and in association with two Tat Translocon substrate proteins, either OEE17 or TorA. In all simulations, either in the presence or absence of substrate, the TatA nonamer markedly thinned the lipid bilayer which may facilitate substrate translocation. The pore of the nonamer was occupied by a phospholipid layer consisting of ~6 phospholipids in the absence of substrates and ~11 phospholipids in their presence. Structurally, the amphipathic helix of TatA were observed to exhibit significant conformational flexibility which appears to facilitate TatA-substrate interactions. In the absence of substrate the TatA nonamer was unstable with its radial architecture collapsing in 200-300 ns. In the presence of substrate, however, the radial geometry of the nonamer persists for at least 1000 ns. Interestingly, in the presence of the smaller substrate OEE17, fewer TatA monomers are retained in a radial geometry then observed in the presence of the larger substrate TorA indicating that the molecularity of the TatA oligomer can adjust to the size of the substrate. Specific hydrophilic residues of the TatA amphipathic helixes were found to interact with both substrate molecules, and these form quite stable charge-pair or hydrogen-bonding interactions. While the substrate proteins were initially placed adjacent to the amphipathic helixes of the nonamer, during the simulation trajectories the substrates moved to a more central position adjacent to, and partially entering, the oligomer pore. Concomitantly, the oligomer was observed to lose phospholipids. These latter observations may constitute a glimpse of the initial stages of protein translocation.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "While phosphorothioate (PS) oligonucleotides are usually used in therapeutic applications, they also offer the cheapest and synthetically most straightforward route to introduce hydrophobic modifications for applications in structural DNA nanotechnology and biophysics. For this, the sulfur atom is S-alkylated with alkyl iodides, enabling a hydrophobically tunable interface of DNA nanostructures with lipid bilayers. While longer and more alkyls per helical turn should lead to stronger interactions with lipid membranes, we found that excessive S-alkylations strongly inhibit hybridization of oligonucleotides to their complementary strands and decrease their melting temperature, despite a reduction in electrostatic repulsion between the two strands. Moreover, both the type and placement of alkyl modifications influence the melting temperature. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal two complementary mechanisms that explain the experimental findings. First, S-alkylated oligonucleotides are more compact and less dynamic than unmodified ones, likely inhibiting their ability to hybridize to their complementary strands. Second, S-alkyls in double-stranded DNA promote defect formation due to alkyl modifications having hydrophobic interactions with other alkyl groups and nucleobases, therefore reducing the thermal and structural stability of alkylated DNA duplexes.

Candidates are then modeled using AlphaFold3 and classified as RTX adhesins if they contain both an N-terminal retention domain and a C-terminal Type I Secretion Signal. Many species have several distinct RTX adhesins, most of which have LBDs, including putative carbohydrate-binding modules and von Willebrand Factor A-like domains, projecting from split domains. Similar adhesin structures can be shared by several species, possibly by descent or by acquisition though DNA uptake. Some species have an RTX adhesin of uncertain function that has no obvious LBDs.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Despite significant advancements in in vitro fertilization (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), implantation rates remain low, ranging from 17 to 21% after three days of incubation, mainly due to stress, lifestyle factors, and uterine conditions. Extended embryo culture techniques have shown promise in improving pregnancy rates. However, the availability of high-quality blastocysts remains a major challenge. Intrafallopian transfer techniques, such as gamete/zygote intrafallopian transfer (GIFT/ZIFT), were introduced to improve fertilization and early embryo development, particularly for patients with repeated embryo implantation failure (10 to 30% of assisted reproduction technology (ART) cases, particularly in women >35). However, these methods have declined due to advancements in IVF and the variability in laparoscopy procedures used for GIFT/ZIFT. To address these challenges, we propose a non-invasive microrobotic embryo transfer (microET) technique using remotely controlled microcarriers comparable in size to embryos. We demonstrate the capabilities of magnetically actuated spiral microrobots, fabricated using laser direct writing for capturing, transporting, and releasing embryos into murine uteri. Additionally, we characterize their motion performance and implement image-guided closed-loop control and dual ultrasound (US)/photoacoustic (PA) tracking for deep-tissue interventions. Recognizing the importance of clinical translation, we present preliminary studies on gelatin-based microrobots, a biodegradable alternative, and explore endometrial remodeling after the in vivo transfer of microrobots carrying embryo-like structures. Our findings show that these microrobots can effectively transport embryos, support their development, and enable minimally invasive delivery, providing a more natural, targeted, and non-invasive strategy for in vivo assisted reproduction.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

However, the persistent challenge of off-target effects continues to hinder its therapeutic applications. Unintended genomic alterations can lead to significant genomic damage, thereby compromising the safety and efficacy of CRISPR-based therapies. Although in-silico prediction tools have made substantial progress, they are not sufficient for capturing the complexity of genomic alterations and experimental validation remains crucial for accurate identification and quantification of off-target effects. In this context, Genome-wide Unbiased Identification of Double-strand breaks Enabled by Sequencing (GUIDE-Seq) has emerged as a gold standard method for the experimental detection of off-target sites and assessment of their prevalence by introducing short double-stranded oligonucleotides (dsODNs) at the break sites created by the nuclease. The bioinformatic analysis of GUIDE-Seq data plays a pivotal yet challenging role in accurately mapping and interpreting editing sites and current pipelines suffer limitations we aim to address in this work. Results: In this study, we present a rapid and versatile single-command pipeline designed for the comprehensive analysis of GuideSeq and similar techniques of sequencing. Our pipeline is capable of simultaneously processing multiplexed libraries from different organisms, PCR orientations, and Cas with different PAM specificities in a single run, all based on user-specified sample information. To ensure reproducibility, the pipeline operates within a closed environment and incorporates a suite of well-established bioinformatics tools. Key novel features include the ability to manage bulges in gDNA/gRNA interaction and multi-hit reads, and a built-in tool for off-target site prediction. The pipeline generates a detailed report that consolidates quality control metrics and provides a curated list of off-target candidates along with their corresponding gRNA alignments. Conclusions: Our pipeline has been tested and successfully applied to analyze samples under a variety of experimental conditions, including different source organisms, PAM motifs, dsODN sequences and PCR orientations. The robustness and flexibility of our pipeline make it a valuable tool for researchers in the field of genome editing.

Said desirable features depend on the efficiency of the ternary interaction wherein the antigen bridges immobilized capture and labelled detection antibodies. However, the cost and the throughput of current screening methods, for finding monoclonal antibody (mAbs) pairs efficient at establishing this type of ternary interactions, remains as a universal bottleneck for LFIA development. Traditional sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), although extensively employed in mAb screening procedures, is burdened by its high consumption of labelled mAbs and the potential alteration of antigen conformation upon plate immobilization, often yielding suboptimal surrogates for native interactions within the final LFIA setup. In this study, we developed an orthogonal approach integrating ELISA and Spectral Shift (SST) that jointly enable the minimisation of reagent consumption (mAbs, antigens, labelling reagents) to comprehensively profile a panel of mAbs against a bona fide antigen of Feline Leukaemia Virus FeLV p27. This facilitated the quick selection of two low nanomolar mAbs with distinct epitope recognition, for which we validated a ternary complex formation in a LFIA prototype. This strategy enables advanced, resource-efficient LFIA development for FeLV and other critical antigens, such as H5 Avian Influenza Virus or African Swine Fever Virus, in addition to major human pathogens including Helicobacter pylori or Mpox Virus, facilitating sensitive diagnostics and streamlined quality control.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

In p210BCR/ABL mice, treatment with BI-3406 or imatinib was well-tolerated in vivo after single or combined use of the drugs. Treatment with imatinib alone significantly improved survival and corrected various hematological parameters of disease burden, while the combination with BI-3406 therapy yielded even more pronounced benefits, including a substantial increase in median survival, marked reductions in peripheral white blood cell and neutrophil counts, and a notable decrease in leukemia stem cells within the bone marrow. Additionally, the combination led to further spleen size reduction and restoration of normal splenic architecture. Human CML cell lines and primary cells from CML patients subjected to combined treatment with BI-3406 and imatinib or later-generation TKI drugs showed significantly reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis as compared to single-agent-treated cultures, revealing a strong synergistic therapeutic behavior of the BI-3406 +TKI combinations. Remarkably, the combined treatments including BI-3406 significantly restored imatinib sensitivity in CML patient cells harboring imatinib-resistant mutations. Cellular signaling and transcriptomics profiling suggested coordinated attenuation of RAS and RAC downstream signals as a mechanistic basis for the observed therapeutic responses. Our findings highlight the synergistic therapeutic behavior of BI-3406 and underscore the benefit of SOS1 pharmacological targeting as a novel strategy enhancing efficacy and overcoming resistance to TKIs in CML.", "date": "2025-09-30", "journal": ""}

Active enhancers are found in open chromatin, which can be mapped at genome scale across tissue and cell types. Though incompletely understood, the relationship between chromatin accessibility and enhancer activity has been exploited to identify, model, and even design functional enhancers for selected cell types, but to what extent this design strategy can generalize across human cell and tissue types remains unclear. Here, we trained deep neural networks on a large corpus of chromatin accessibility data from hundreds of human biosamples. We used these models to generate an atlas of tens of thousands of synthetic enhancers, targeting hundreds of cell lines, tissues, and differentiation states, aiming to maximize accessibility in target samples and minimize it in all off-target ones. Experimental testing of thousands of designs in a representative subset of ten human cell types and in mouse retina demonstrated their function as specific enhancers, not only in the case of one-versus-all objectives but also when targeting two or three cell types. An explainable AI analysis, enabled by our large-scale enhancer measurements, allowed us to identify similarities and differences between the sequence grammar underlying accessibility and enhancer activity.

Nuclear division was accompanied by centriole duplication and elongated microtubules that spanned dividing nuclei. Surprisingly, C. parvum centromeres showed diffuse staining throughout nuclear division, and telomeres overlapped with centromeres at the apical nuclear end. Analysis of centromeres based on CENH3 binding and DNA sequencing revealed ~350 distinct binding sites scattered across all eight chromosomes, typified by GA rich repeat sequences.

Based on the observed movement behavior of 84 pumas (Puma concolor) in the Santa Cruz Mountains, we characterized individual variation in tolerance towards anthropogenic presence and used EcoScape, a novel functional habitat connectivity algorithm, to predict how individual differences in behavior affect the connectivity and dispersal capacity of an at-risk carnivore population. We found that individual differences in human tolerance have a greater effect than sex-based differences on modeled ability to disperse through anthropogenic landscapes, and strongly influence connectivity.

While genome-wide analyses have revealed that intramolecular epistatic interactions can drive the spatial clustering of amino acid substitutions, direct empirical evidence for such interactions and their evolutionary consequences remains limited. Using a statistical screen for lineage-specific clustering of adaptive substitutions in Drosophila, we systematically identify experimentally tractable candidate proteins with evidence for spatially-clustered adaptive amino acid substitutions for functional genetic analysis. As proof of concept, we focus on the Trio protein, which exhibits three spatially-clustered adaptive amino acid substitutions in along the D. melanogaster lineage. Through systematic reconstruction of evolutionary intermediates in vivo, we find that intermediate states exhibit reduced fitness, providing strong evidence for epistatic constraints on evolutionary trajectories. Notably, we find that the deleterious effects of intermediates are recessive, suggesting that intermediate combinations of epistatically interacting amino acid substitutions can arise and be maintained in heterozygotes before fixation.

Genetically variable Chromosome 2s evolved in two separate pools within each population. One pool experienced patrilinear inheritance (segregated like a Y-chromosome) and male-limited selection, while the alternative pool segregated like an X-chromosome and experienced female-biased selection. We measured female fitness when exposed to males carrying either chromosome type at either normal (continuous) or reduced (periodic) male exposure, over three time periods. Males carrying either type of chromosome were harmful to females, but males carrying a male-limited chromosome displayed increased harmfulness, suggesting ongoing selection for mate harm that is constrained under normal inheritance.

Despite deep genomic differentiation, clades show remarkable similarity in morphology, habitat use, and thermal biology. Nearly all genetic differentiation (87%) is explained by isolation by distance and seasonal variation in precipitation, with almost no effect of temperature. Behavioral thermoregulation and changes in activity time accommodate strong macro- and micro-climatic differences, buffering against selection that would otherwise drive morphological and physiological divergence. In contrast, genomic signatures of selection and divergence in genes associated with the nervous system, sensory perception, and biomolecule metabolism indicate adaptation to differences in rainfall seasonality.

While their canonical signaling is typically repulsive and ligand-dependent, non-canonical activity promotes cell migration and proliferation in several cancers through ligand-independent mechanisms. Proteases associated with neurodegeneration can cleave Eph receptors, generating near full-length intracellular region (ICR) fragments, whose signaling potential remains unclear. Here, we dissect the mechanistic contributions of the sterile  motif (SAM) domain and tyrosine phosphorylation to the behavior of the EphA2 ICR, one of the best-characterized Eph receptors. The ICR expressed in E. coli retains kinase activity and undergoes phosphorylation at tyrosine residues identified in eukaryotic systems. This phosphorylation reduces domain interactions, as measured by microscale thermophoresis. AlphaFold2Multimer models and available crystal structures of EphA2 dimers provide limited mechanistic insights, likely due to crystal packing effects. Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations (Martini 3.0), we find that SAM-kinase interactions are predominantly transient but show clustering in two kinase-domain regions. NMR spectroscopy with assigned EphA2 SAM domains reveals non-canonical ICR contacts, potentially keeping the canonical SAM interface accessible for partner binding. Introduction of the SHIP2 SAM domain results in canonical EphA2-SHIP2 interactions, along with unexpected contacts with the kinase domain.
