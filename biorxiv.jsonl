A.", "abstract": "The inner ear contains distinct sensory organs, produced sequentially by segregation from a large sensory-competent domain in the developing otic vesicle. To understand the mechanistic basis of this process, we investigated the changes in prosensory cell patterning, proliferation and character during the segregation of some of the vestibular organs in the mouse and chicken otic vesicle. We discovered a specialized boundary domain, located at the interface of segregating organs. It is composed of prosensory cells that gradually enlarge, elongate and are ultimately diverted from a prosensory fate. Strikingly, the boundary cells align their apical borders and constrict basally at the interface of cells expressing or not the Lmx1a transcription factor, an orthologue of drosophila Apterous. The boundary domain is absent in Lmx1a-deficient mice, which exhibit defects in sensory organ segregation, and is disrupted by the inhibition of ROCK-dependent actomyosin contractility. Altogether, our results suggest that actomyosin-dependent tissue boundaries ensure the proper separation of inner ear sensory organs and uncover striking homologies between this process and the compartmentalization of the drosophila wing disc by lineage-restricted boundaries.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

They are organized as an attractor, and anchor to the environment via visual landmarks. Here we examine how thalamic HD signals and landmark information from the retrosplenial cortex combine in the presubiculum. We find that monosynaptic excitatory connections from anterior thalamic nucleus and from retrosplenial cortex converge on single layer 3 pyramidal neurons in the dorsal portion of mouse presubiculum. Independent dual wavelength photostimulation of these inputs in slices leads to action potential generation preferentially for near-coincident inputs, indicating that layer 3 neurons can transmit a visually matched HD signal to medial entorhinal cortex. Layer 4 neurons, which innervate the lateral mammillary nucleus, form a second step in the association of HD and landmark signals. They receive little direct input from thalamic and retrosplenial axons. We show that layer 4 cells are excited di-synaptically, transforming regular spiking activity into bursts of action potentials, and that their firing is enhanced by cholinergic agonists. Thus, a coherent sense of orientation involves projection specific translaminar processing in the presubiculum, where neuromodulation facilitates landmark updating of HD signals in the lateral mammillary nucleus.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Due to its heterogeneous pathogenesis, conventional single-target therapies often show limited efficacy. Multicomponent ayurveda formulations offer a promising alternative through their multitargeted actions. This study explores the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of Lodhrasavam (LS), a classical, polyherbal ayurveda formulation, in both in vitro and in vivo models of MASLD. Methods: LS was evaluated for its anti-steatotic and anti-obesogenic potential using in vitro (HepG2, 3T3L1) and in vivo (HFHFD-induced rat) models. Antioxidant, lipase inhibition, cytotoxicity, anti-steatotic, and anti-adipogenic activities were assessed via DPPH, MTT, ORO/BODIPY staining, triglyceride quantification, ROS assay, and qPCR. Lipidomic profiling was done in HepG2 cells. Biochemical analyses (GLP1, insulin, lipid panel), histopathology and OGTT further validated efficacy. Data were statistically analyzed by one-way ANOVA (p<0.05). Results/discussion: In HepG2 cells, LS reduced PA-induced lipid accumulation, ROS, triglycerides, and restored viability, while downregulating lipogenic genes (PPAR{gamma}, SREBP-1c, FASN). Lipidomics confirmed lipid modulation. In 3T3-L1 cells, LS suppressed adipogenesis and key adipogenic genes. In HFD-fed rats, LS reduced weight gain, hepatic steatosis, serum lipids, and improved liver histology. LS enhanced insulin and GLP1 secretion, improved glucose tolerance, and restored pancreatic islet structure. These findings highlight the multitargeted potential of LS in ameliorating MASLD by modulating lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and glucose homeostasis. Conclusion: Lodhrasavam ameliorates MASLD by modulating the liver, adipose and pancreas axis, improving lipid metabolism, reducing inflammation, and enhancing insulin and GLP1 secretion through multitargeted mechanisms.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

The tbtAMR tool is suitable for use in clinical and public health microbiology laboratory settings, and can be tailored to specific local needs by non-programmers. We have accredited this tool to ISO standards in our laboratory, and it has been implemented for routine reporting of AMR from genomic sequence data in a clinically relevant timeframe.

Here, we used a deep neural network (DNN) to generate a high-level, small-dimension representational space for voice identity - the 'voice latent space' (VLS) - and examined its linear relation with cerebral activity via encoding, representational similarity, and decoding analyses. We find that the VLS maps onto fMRI measures of cerebral activity in response to tens of thousands of voice stimuli from hundreds of different speaker identities and better accounts for the representational geometry for speaker identity in the TVAs than in A1.

In this work, we model two scalar measures of the sequence-dependent propensity of DNA to wrap into nucleosomes: the energy of DNA required to assume a particular nucleosomal configuration and a measure related to the probability of linear DNA spontaneously reaching the nucleosomal configuration.

While the exponential and stationary growth phases have been characterized in the model bacterium Escherichia coli, little is known about what transpires inside individual cells during the transition between these two phases. Through quantitative cell imaging, we found that the positions of nucleoids and cell division sites become increasingly asymmetric during transition phase. These asymmetries were coupled with asymmetric reorganization of protein, ribosome, and RNA probes in the cytoplasm. Results from live-cell imaging experiments, complemented with genetic and 13C whole-cell nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies, show that preferential accumulation of the storage polymer glycogen at the old cell pole leads to the observed rearrangements and asymmetric divisions. Live-cell atomic force microscopy analysis, combined with in vitro biochemical experiments, suggests that these phenotypes are due to the propensity of glycogen to phase separate into soft condensates in the crowded cytoplasm. Glycogen-associated differences in cell sizes between strains and future daughter cells suggest that glycogen phase separation allows cells to store large glucose reserves without counting them as cytoplasmic space.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we quantify this response for a salmonid species with a novel laboratory approach coupled with image-based tracking. We exposed brown trout parr (Salmo trutta), acclimated to 12 degrees C, to rapidly forming cold- and warm-water interfaces with temperatures ranging from 4 to 20 degrees C. We found that fish actively avoided colder water (less than or equal to 8 degrees C) through a rapid response that combined thermotaxis and thermokinesis. In contrast, fish did not avoid warmer water and frequently crossed interfaces having temperature contrasts of up to 8 deg C.

W.", "abstract": "Neural activity has been observed to lie on low-dimensional manifolds, constraining what behaviors are easier or harder to learn. We propose that beyond this geometric constraint, learning on fast timescales is limited by how neural activity can flow over time within these manifolds -- i.e., by the system's underlying dynamics. In primary motor cortex (M1), these neural dynamics are shaped not only by internal recurrence but also by sensory feedback inputs that can continually update cortical activity and compensate for external perturbations. By extending recurrent neural network modeling with adaptive feedback controllers in a brain-computer interface (BCI) task, we show that feedback-driven dynamics determine not just the robustness but also the flexibility of motor output, and constrain what movements can be efficiently learned. Through a control-theoretic approach, we quantitatively link learning speed and success for individual BCI decoders to underlying network properties, demonstrating that input-driven dynamical structure limits the class of decoders that can be learned on fast timescales. Crucially, this dynamical systems perspective explains a continuous form of experimentally-observed learning variability that has previously not been addressed. We also make a testable prediction that rapid adaptation to new BCI decoders depends on upstream input plasticity, such as remapping of sensory feedback, beyond local plasticity within M1. Overall, our work identifies potential network mechanisms for fast but limited motor learning, and clarifies how constraints on learning arise from both the geometry of neural activity and its underlying dynamical structure.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Critically short telomeres induce cellular senescence and division arrest, which eventually may lead to devastating age-related degenerative diseases. Conversely, maintenance of telomere length is a hallmark of cancer. How telomere set-length is established and molecular mechanisms for telomere-specific length regulation remained unknown. Here we detail a mechanism of a telomere-specific set-length regulation that causes drastic differences in telomere length between individual telomeres in the same cell. Indeed, the results show that telomerase recruitment is modulated in cis in a telomere-specific way. Increased Sir4 abundance on yeast TEL03L subtelomeric heterochromatin leads to a set-length maintenance that is two to three times higher than on any other telomere. Remarkably, the distal 15 kb of TEL03L are sufficient to transfer this telomere specific set-length regulation to another chromosome. Furthermore, a mutation in the telomere boundary element protein Tbf1 allows increased Sir4 binding on all telomeres and hence results in longer set-lengths. The results therefore will force a rethinking of telomere length regulation away from the generalized view that all telomeres are treated the same to a more telomere-specific treatment.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

To determine which dietary proteins are efficiently digested by the host, and which proteins escape host digestion and are used by the gut microbiota, we used high-resolution mass spectrometry to quantify proteins that constitute different dietary protein sources before and after digestion in germ-free and conventionally raised mice. We detected proteins from all sources in fecal samples of both germ-free and conventional mice suggesting that even protein sources with high digestive efficiency make it to the colon where they can serve as metabolic substrate for gut microbiota. Additionally, we found that specific component proteins of dietary protein sources were degraded to a greater extent in the presence of the microbiota. We found that specific proteins with functions that could potentially impact host health and physiology were differentially enriched in germ-free or conventionally raised mice. These findings reveal large differences in the fate of dietary protein from various sources in the gut which could explain some of their differential health impacts.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

However, despite numbering in the dozens in Escherichia coli, and hundreds in humans, same-strand frameshifted sORFs that internally overlap protein coding sequences remain understudied. To provide insight into nested genes, we characterized GndA, a frameshifted 36-amino acid microprotein nested within the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) coding sequence. Using precise genome editing, we demonstrate independent contributions of GndA and 6PGD to cell growth at high temperature. GndA associates with membrane-associated complexes associated with electron transport and ATP generation, and supports ATP homeostasis during heat shock. Functional characterization of GndA thus adds to the catalog of bacterial microproteins that function in stress responses, while providing clear genetic evidence for the importance of an overlapping gene to cellular fitness.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we combine a hyper-efficient version of Lachnospiraceae bacterium dCas12a (dHyperLbCas12a) with RNA Polymerase II expression of long CRISPR RNA (crRNA) arrays to enable efficient highly-multiplexed epigenome editing.

We further show that the system can be used in cultured primary immune cells and to drive differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells. We also developed new approaches to use the dCas12a platform for simultaneous activation and repression from a single crRNA array via co-expression of multiple dCas12a orthologues. Lastly, we demonstrate that the dHyperLbCas12a effectors are highly effective for multiple modalities of high-throughput screens, namely proliferation screens and screens to dissect the independent and combinatorial contributions of CREs on gene expression.

Points of convergence vary between the cell types of the brain and are greatest in mature glutamatergic neurons, where they broadly target not just synaptic and epigenetic, but unexpectedly, mitochondrial biology. The strongest convergent networks occur between NDD genes with common co-expression patterns in the post-mortem brain, biological annotations, and clinical associations, suggesting that convergence may one-day inform patient stratification and treatment.

While many theoretical, computational, and statistical advances have been made in understanding the genomic signatures of selective sweeps in recombining populations, relatively less is understood in populations with little/no recombination, and arbitrary dominance and inbreeding. Using diffusion theory, we obtain the full expression for the expected site frequency spectrum (SFS) at linked neutral sites immediately post and during the fixation of moderately or strongly beneficial mutations. When a single hard sweep occurs, the SFS decays as 1/x for low derived allele frequencies (x), similar to the neutral SFS at equilibrium, whereas at higher derived allele frequencies, it follows a 1/x2 power law as also seen in a rapidly expanding neutral population. We show that these power laws are universal in the sense that they are independent of the dominance and inbreeding coefficients, and also characterize the SFS during the sweep. Additionally, we find that the derived allele frequency where the SFS shifts from the 1/x to 1/x2 power law is inversely proportional to the selection strength; thus under strong selection, the SFS follows the 1/x2 dependence for most allele frequencies, resembling a rapidly expanding neutral population. When clonal interference is pervasive, the SFS immediately post-fixation becomes U-shaped and can be approximated by the equilibrium SFS of selected sites.

In this study, we employed a full factorial experimental design to investigate the effects of isocaloric diets (diets with equal caloric content but differing macronutrient composition) on key life-history traits in an outbred Drosophila melanogaster population. Our results demonstrated significant diet-induced plasticity, with male wing length (a proxy for body size) being influenced by the developmental diet; males reared on carbohydrate-rich developmental diets had larger wings as adults. Fertility increased with protein-rich diets at both developmental and adult stages, reaffirming the critical role of dietary protein in enhancing reproductive success. Lifespan exhibited sexually dimorphic responses to diet: carbohydrate-rich developmental diets extended male lifespan, while carbohydrate-rich adult diets reduced lifespan in both sexes. Stress resistance traits, including starvation and desiccation resistance, were unaffected by developmental diets but were influenced by adult diets, with carbohydrate-rich adult diets enhancing survival under both stress conditions in males and females. Importantly, while most traits exhibited additive effects of nutrition across life stages, a marginal interaction for male starvation resistance suggests that developmental and adult diets can interact in a trait- and sex-specific manner.

Cholecystokinin-positive (CCK+) neurons in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) are critical for neuropathic pain, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that the membrane estrogen receptor G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER/GPR30) in spinal neurons was significantly upregulated in chronic constriction injury (CCI) mice and that inhibition of GPR30 in CCK+ neurons reversed CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Furthermore, GPR30 in spinal CCK+ neurons was essential for the enhancement of AMPA-mediated excitatory synaptic transmission in CCI mice. Moreover, GPR30 was expressed in spinal CCK+ neurons that received direct projection from the primary sensory cortex (S1-SDH). Chemogenetic inhibition of S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons alleviated CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Conversely, chemogenetic activation of these neurons mimicked neuropathic pain symptoms, which were attenuated by spinal inhibition of GPR30. Finally, we confirmed that GPR30 in S1-SDH post-synaptic neurons was required for CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Taken together, our findings suggest that GPR30 in spinal CCK+ neurons is pivotal for neuropathic pain and GPR30 mediates descending facilitation by corticospinal direct projections, thereby representing a promising therapeutic target for neuropathic pain.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Pharmacological interventions are limited by adverse side effects, and effective nonpharmacological alternatives remain to be identified. Here, we introduce a novel attention shifting method based on a closed-loop, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven, wearable mindfulness brain-computer interface (BCI) to alleviate car sickness. As the user performs an attentional task, i.e., focusing on breathing as in mindfulness, with a wearable headband, the BCI collects and analyses electroencephalography (EEG) data via a convolutional neural network to assess the user's mindfulness state and provide real-time audiovisual feedback. This approach might sustainedly shift the user's attention from physiological discomfort towards the BCI-based mindfulness practices, thereby mitigating car sickness symptoms. The efficacy of the proposed method was rigorously evaluated in two real-world experiments, namely, short and long car rides, with a large cohort of more than 100 participants susceptible to car sickness. Remarkably, over 83% of the participants rated the BCI-based attention shifting as effective, with significant reductions in car sickness severity, particularly in individuals with severe symptoms. Furthermore, EEG data analysis revealed a neurobiological signature of car sickness, which provided mechanistic insights into the efficacy of the BCI-based attention shifting for alleviating car sickness. This study proposed the first large-scale validated, nonpharmacological and wearable intervention method and system for car sickness, with the potential to transform the travel experiences of hundreds of millions of people suffering from car sickness, which also represents a new application of BCI technology.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

P.; Blazsek, M.; Makara, J.

New PFs are constantly born even in familiar surroundings (during representational drift), and many rapidly emerge when the animal explores a new or altered environment (during global or partial remapping). Behavioral time scale synaptic plasticity (BTSP), a plasticity mechanism based on prolonged somatic action potential (AP) bursts induced by dendritic Ca2+/NMDA plateau potentials, was recently proposed as the main cellular mechanism underlying new PF formations (PFF), but it is unclear whether burst-associated large somatic [Ca2+] transients are always necessary and/or sufficient for PFF. To address this issue, here we performed in vivo two-photon [Ca2+] imaging of hippocampal CA1 PCs in head-restrained mice to investigate somatic [Ca2+] dynamics underlying PFFs in familiar and novel virtual environments. Our results demonstrate that although many PFs are formed by BTSP-like events, PFs also emerge with initial [Ca2+] dynamics that do not match any of the characteristics of BTSP. BTSP and non-BTSP-like new PFFs occur spontaneously in familiar environments, during neuronal representational switches and instantaneously in new environments. Our data also reveal that solitary [Ca2+] transients with larger amplitudes than those evoking BTSP-like PFFs, frequently occur without inducing PFs, demonstrating that large [Ca2+] transients per se are not sufficient for PFF.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

This migration is thought to occur within structures called 'streams,' which are considered crucial for initiating aggregation. The prevailing traffic jam model hypothesizes that intersections of streams cause cell crowding and 'jamming,' thereby initiating the process of aggregate formation. However, this hypothesis has not been rigorously tested, in part due to the lack of a standardized, quantifiable definition of streams. To address this gap, we captured time-lapse movies and conducted fluorescent cell tracking experiments using wild-type and two motility-deficient mutant M. xanthus strains. By quantitatively defining streams and developing a novel stream detection mask, we show that streams are not essential for nascent aggregate formation, though they may accelerate the process. Moreover, our results indicate that streaming has a genetic component: disrupting only one of the two M. xanthus motility systems hinders stream formation. Together, these findings challenge the idea that stream intersections are required to drive aggregate formation and suggest that M. xanthus aggregation may be driven by mechanisms independent of streaming, highlighting the need for alternative models to fully explain aggregation dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

There have been active efforts over the years to understand and exploit the population specific vs. shared aspects of the genotype-phenotype relation across different populations or ethnicities to bridge this gap. However no single approach that unanimously outperforms all other methods exists. Furthermore, the efficacy of transfer learning models that are simpler than existing approaches remains an open question. We propose MultiPopPred, a suite of novel and simple trans-ethnic polygenic risk score (PRS) estimation methods, that tap into the shared genetic risk across populations and transfer information learned from multiple well-studied auxiliary populations to a less-studied target population. MultiPopPred employs a specially designed Nesterov-smoothed penalized shrinkage model and a L-BFGS optimization routine. Extensive comparative analyses performed on simulated genotype-phenotype data reveal that MultiPopPred improves PRS prediction in the South Asian population by 69% on settings with low target sample sizes, by 19% overall across all simulation settings, and by 73% overall across all semi-simulated settings when compared to state-of-the-art trans-ethnic PRS estimation methods.

While traditional accounts treat controllability as a fixed property of the environment, in the real-world this property often depends on the effort, time, and money that we are willing and able to invest. In such cases, controllability can be said to be elastic to invested resources. Here we propose that inferring this elasticity is essential for efficient resource allocation, and thus, elasticity misestimations result in maladaptive behavior. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel treasure hunt game where participants encountered environments with varying degrees of controllability and elasticity. Across two pre-registered studies (N=514), we first demonstrate that people infer elasticity and adapt their resource allocation accordingly. We then present a computational model that explains how people make this inference, and identify individual elasticity biases that lead to suboptimal resource allocation. Finally, we show that overestimation of elasticity is associated with elevated psychopathology involving an impaired sense of control. These findings establish the elasticity of control as a distinct cognitive construct guiding adaptive behavior, and a computational marker for control-related maladaptive behavior.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Using truncated variants of the GP1 glycoprotein fused to the plastic-degrading enzyme PHL7, we identified the PPSPX motif as critical for anchoring proteins to the cell wall. Constructs with increased PPSPX content exhibited reduced secretion but enhanced anchoring, revealing key anchor-signal sites within GP1. To enable controlled release, we incorporated a pH-sensitive intein from derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis RecA. Under acidic conditions (pH 5.5), this intein efficiently cleaved and released mCherry and PHL7 from the GP1 anchor. Fluorescence kinetics demonstrated significant mCherry release from the mCherry-intein-GP1 construct within 4 hours at pH 5.5, while release was minimal at pH 8.0 and negligible for the mCherry-GP1 control. Western blot analysis confirmed efficient cleavage, showing a lower band corresponding to free mCherry at pH 5.5 and no release at pH 8.0. This anchor-release strategy integrates glycomodules with pH-sensitive inteins to enable precise spatial and temporal protein control.

They play a key role in disseminating adaptive traits, such as antimicrobial resistance and virulence. Understanding plasmid mobility and its association with these traits is crucial to microbial ecology, public health and genomic surveillance. Several databases have been developed to catalogue plasmids assembled from bacterial isolates and metagenomic samples. However, differences in database construction and curation can introduce biases that affect subsequent analyses. In this study, we compare three distinct plasmid genome datasets - the NCBI Reference Sequence Database (RefSeq), the Integrated Microbial Genomes & Microbiomes system (IMG/PR) from bacterial isolates (I) and microbiomes (M) - to assess the influence of data origin on inferences about plasmid mobility types, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), virulence genes (VGs) and host taxonomy. Our analysis reveals that plasmids assembled from metagenomes tend to be smaller than those assembled from isolates. RefSeq plasmids are enriched in conjugative plasmids (pCONJ) and display a higher frequency of ARGs and VGs. In contrast, regardless of whether they originate from isolates or metagenomes, IMG/PR plasmids are enriched in mobilizable plasmids (pMOB). Furthermore, ARGs are more frequently associated with highly mobile plasmids, particularly pCONJ.

Furthermore, the imaging speed is enhanced 10-fold by adapting the light sheet's motion with a closed-loop feedback, reaching 100 frames per second while maintaining isotropic resolution across the large field of view.

Here, we use a decade-long, individual-based study of urban and forest great tits (Parus major) to analyse urbanisation, climate and their interactive effects on yellow breast colouration, a carotenoid-based trait. We find that urban birds exhibit duller colourations than forest counterparts, being 10-20% less chromatic, with first-year birds and males being more negatively impacted in cities. Additionally, birds in the city are more sexually dichromatic than in the forest. Over the decade, colouration differences between habitats remain stable, following a similar quadratic temporal pattern. Finally, while climate has a weak effect on colouration, urban birds appear more sensitive to its influence than forest birds. Our results indicate urbanisation has a stronger impact than climate on great tit colouration, though both factors may interact.

It affects all membrane-associated processes ranging from curvature generation to membrane fission. Yet, we lack detailed mechanistic understanding of how lipid packing directly affects these processes in cellular membranes. Here, we address this by focusing on caveolae, small {Omega}-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane which serve as key regulators of cellular lipid sorting and mechano-responses. In addition to caveolae coat proteins, the lipid membrane is a core component of caveolae that critically impacts both the biogenesis, morphology and stability of such membrane invaginations. We show that the small compound Dyngo-4a adsorbs and inserts into the membrane, resulting in a dramatic dynamin-independent inhibition of caveola dynamics. Analysis of model membranes in combination with molecular dynamics simulations revealed that a substantial amount of Dyngo-4a was inserted and positioned at the level of cholesterol in the bilayer affecting lipid order in a cholesterol dependent manner. Dyngo-4a-treatment resulted in decreased lipid packing of the plasma membrane. This prevented caveolae internalization and lateral diffusion without affecting their morphology, associated proteins, or the overall cell stiffness.

High-throughput metagenomic sequencing has provided unprecedented insights into the structure and function of these communities. However, functionally profiling metagenomes remains constrained due to the limited sensitivity of existing sequence homology-based methods to annotate evolutionarily divergent genes. Protein structure, more conserved than sequence, and intrinsically tied to molecular function, offers a solution. Capitalising on recent breakthroughs in structural bioinformatics, we present EcoFoldDB, a database of protein structures curated for ecologically relevant microbial traits, and its companion pipeline, EcoFoldDB-annotate, which leverages Foldseek with the ProstT5 protein language model for rapid structural homology searching directly from sequence data. EcoFoldDB-annotate outperforms state-of-the-art sequence-based methods in annotating metagenomic proteins, in terms of sensitivity and precision. To demonstrate its utility and scalability, we performed structure-guided functional profiling of 32 million proteins encoded by 8,000 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes from the global soil microbiome. EcoFoldDB-annotate could resolve the phylogenetic partitioning of important nitrogen cycling pathways, from taxonomically restricted nitrifiers to more widespread denitrifiers, as well as identifying novel, uncultivated bacterial taxa enriched in plant growth-promoting traits.

S.; Bukau, B.", "abstract": "The heat shock response (HSR) is the major defense mechanism against proteotoxic stress in the cytosol and nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Initiation and attenuation of the response are mediated by stress-dependent regulation of heat shock transcription factors (HSFs). Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a single HSF (Hsf1), facilitating the analysis of HSR regulation. Hsf1 is repressed by Hsp70 chaperones under non-stress conditions, and becomes activated under proteotoxic stress, directly linking protein damage and its repair to the HSR. J-domain proteins (JDPs) are essential for targeting of Hsp70s to their substrates, yet the specific JDP(s) regulating Hsf1 and connecting protein damage to HSR activation remain unclear. Here we show that the yeast nuclear JDP Apj1 primarily controls the attenuation phase of HSR by promoting the Hsf1{acute}s displacement from heat shock elements in target DNA. In apj1{Delta} cells, HSR attenuation is significantly impaired. Additionally, yeast cells lacking both Apj1 and the major JDP Ydj1 exhibit increased HSR activation even in non-stress conditions, indicating their distinct regulatory roles. Apj1{acute}s role in both nuclear protein quality control and Hsf1 regulation underscores its role in directly linking nuclear proteostasis to HSR regulation.

The SULTR family has historically been classified into four groups (SULTR1-SULTR4), with well-characterized roles for SULTR groups 1, 2, and 4. However, the functions of the large and diverse SULTR3 group remain poorly understood. Here, we present an updated phylogenetic analysis of SULTRs across angiosperms, including multiple early-divergent lineages. Our results suggest that the enigmatic SULTR3 group comprises four distinct subfamilies that predate the emergence of angiosperms, providing a basis for reclassifying the SULTR family into seven subfamilies. This expanded classification is supported by subfamily-specific gene structures and amino acid substitutions in the substrate-binding pocket. Structural modeling identified three serine residues uniquely lining the substrate-binding pocket of SULTR3.4, enabling three hydrogen bonds with the phosphate ion. The data support the proposed neofunctionalization of this subfamily for phosphate allocation within vascular tissues. Transcriptome analysis of Populus tremula x alba revealed divergent tissue expression preferences among SULTR subfamilies and between genome duplicates. We observed partitioned expression in vascular tissues among the four SULTR3 subfamilies, with PtaSULTR3.4a and PtaSULTR3.2a preferentially expressed in primary and secondary xylem, respectively. Gene coexpression analysis revealed coordinated expression of PtaSULTR3.4a with genes involved in phosphate starvation responses and nutrient transport, consistent with a potential role in phosphate homeostasis. In contrast, PtaSULTR3.2a was strongly coexpressed with lignification and one-carbon metabolism genes and their upstream transcription regulators. PtaSULTR3.2a belongs to a eudicot-specific branch of the SULTR3.1 subfamily found only in perennial species, suggesting a specialized role in lignifying tissues.

Here we investigate how a mild electric field (similar in magnitude to that imposed on biological membranes) remodels the nanofibril structure of chitosan hydrogels using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations revealed a novel mechanism of active dewetting, in which the electric field enhances fibrillar order and induces compaction along the sheet-stacking direction through expulsion of water and stabilization of the hydrogen-bond network within and between fibril sheets. This mechanism provides a physical basis for a recent experimental observation that electrodeposited chitosan hydrogel film undergoes vertical contraction. The electric field-induced dewetting between amphiphilic chitosan sheets is reminiscent of but fundamentally different from the classic dewetting phenomenon for purely hydrophobic systems, which has been intensively studied by both theoretical and experimental communities in the past.

However, molecular subtyping in CRC traditionally relies on bulk transcriptomics, therefore, lacks spatial and single-cell level aspect. Methods: We constructed tissue microarrays using tumor cores from 222 CRC patients. Arrays were stained and imaged using 54 cell identity and cancer hallmark markers, delivering spatially resolved protein profiles of >2 million cells. RNA sequencing data and CMS classification were also available for these patients. After segmentation of cancer, stromal and immune cells, we investigated intratumoral heterogeneity within CMS subtypes using spatially resolved single-cell protein profiling (>2 million cells). We compared cell types, their spatial organization and their expression of cancer hallmark-related proteins in CMS 1-4 subtypes. Results: We revealed tissue atlases illustrating the cell types/states, spatial heterogeneity, cellular neighborhoods, cellular network, and single-cell protein profiles of CMS tumors. CMS1 tumors had more CD3+, CD8+, and PD1+ immune cells that were found in the epithelial layer frequently. CMS1 was also associated with higher levels of metabolic reprogramming markers such as upregulated glycolysis. CMS2 showed immune segregation, reactive stroma patterns and higher levels of apoptotic and proliferative signaling proteins. CMS3 exhibited clustered cancer cells with high RIP3 levels, suggesting a pro-inflammatory microenvironment.

Although such cellular impurities in hCTPs can be assessed by detecting anchorage-independent growth using conventional soft agar colony formation (SACF) assays, the sensitivity of these assays is often insufficient. To overcome this limitation, we previously developed a novel tumorigenicity-associated testing method, the digital SACF (D-SACF) assay, which combines a partitioned culture of test cells to concentrate target cells with colony detection via image analysis. However, conventional soft agar culture involves complicated operations, such as preparing multilayered culture media and temperature control, and further technical optimization is required for the widespread adoption of the D-SACF assay. In this study, we focused on a new culture system incorporating a three-dimensional (3D) culture method using a liquid medium containing the low-molecular-weight agar polymer LA717 in low-adhesion culture vessels. We initially confirmed conditions for the efficient high-density 3D culture of normal cells using LA717-supplemented medium in low-adhesion 96-well plates. Using human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) as a normal cell model and HeLa cells as a transformed cell model, we demonstrated that the new 3D culture system effectively maintained the dispersion of MSCs and prevented their aggregation, while transformed HeLa cells exhibited robust anchorage independence, thereby establishing the new liquid/low-molecular-weight agar colony formation (LACF) method as an alternative to SACF. Finally, by systematizing the digital analysis system for the LACF assay (D-LACF assay), which streamlines the overall workflow from the performance evaluation of the test method to product testing and result interpretation, the limitations of the conventional soft agar-based D-SACF assay were addressed and its practicality and utility were enhanced.

In Staphylococcus aureus, the ClpXP complex targets the peptidoglycan hydrolase Sle1, maintaining a tightly regulated balance between peptidoglycan biosynthesis and hydrolysis, which is required to ensure proper cell splitting without compromising cell integrity. {beta}-lactams antibiotics disturb this balance, leading to their bactericidal effects. The mechanism underlying the specific targeting of Sle1 by the conserved ClpXP complex remains unknown. From a genome-wide screen for determinants of penicillin G susceptibility in S. aureus, we here identify the uncharacterized protein CxaR (for ClpXP-associated autolytic regulator). Growth defects, premature cell splitting, and increased cell lysis were observed in the absence of CxaR. Interestingly, these defects were mitigated by sublethal concentrations of {beta}-lactams. Through sequencing cxaR suppressor mutants, followed by immunoblotting, we show that the cxaR phenotypes are caused by excessive Sle1 accumulation. Indeed, exposure to {beta}-lactams reduces Sle1 levels, thereby rescuing the cells lacking CxaR. Furthermore, in vivo protein-protein interaction assays demonstrated that CxaR directly interacts with both ClpXP and Sle1, whereas no direct interaction was detected between Sle1 and ClpX. In line with this, CxaR was found to co-localize with ClpX fociadjacent to the septum. Taken together, these findings reveal that CxaR is a new regulatory factor controlling staphylococcal cell splitting by acting as an adaptor protein for controlled ClpXP-mediated degradation of Sle1.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

However, the alterations in higher-order genome organization in which these changes occur and their functional implications are less well understood. To explore how chromatin structure and epigenetic parameters of genome architecture changes during cancer progression at a fine scale and genome-wide, we generated high-resolution Micro-C contact maps in non-malignant, pre-cancerous, and metastatic MCF10 breast cancer epithelial cells. We profiled progression-associated reorganization of chromatin compartments, topologically associated domains (TADs), and chromatin loops, and also identified invariable chromatin features. We find large-scale compartmental shifts occur predominantly in early stages of cancer development, with more fine-scale structural changes in TADs and looping accumulating during the later transition to metastasis. We related these structural features to changes in gene expression, histone marks, and potential enhancers and found a large portion of differentially expressed genes physically connected to distal regulatory elements. While changes in chromatin loops were relatively rare during progression, differential loops were enriched for progression-associated genes, including those involved in proliferation, angiogenesis, and differentiation. Changes in either enhancer-promoter contacts or distal enhancer activity were accompanied by differential gene regulation, suggesting that changes in chromatin contacts are not necessary but can be sufficient for gene regulation.

Using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models, we evaluate and compare their potential toxicity on healthy tissues. Methods and Materials Cell survival, tissue response, and developmental toxicity were assessed across three biological models. In vitro, human fibroblasts (MRC5-hTERT) were used to generate post-irradiation survival curves. Ex vivo, precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from mice were analyzed for radiation-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. In vivo, zebrafish embryos were used to evaluate developmental toxicity through body length and spinal curvature measurements. VHEE irradiations were performed using a broadband electron beam spanning 50-300 MeV, using the Salle Jaune LPA (Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquee, France), while CIEE exposures were performed with a 7 MeV conventional LINAC (Institut Curie, France). Results In vitro MRC5-hTERT cells showed no significant difference in radiosensitivity between VHEE and CIEE, with comparable D10 values (p-value = 0.7). In the ex vivo model, both beams induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell division with no significant inter-beam differences at any dose level (p-value > 0.99). In vivo, zebrafish embryos exhibited dose-dependent body shortening and increased spinal curvature following both VHEE and CIEE exposure. No significant differences were observed between the two modalities at matched doses for any measured metric (p-values [&ge;] 0.5).

A.", "abstract": "The medial nucleus accumbens shell (medNAcSh) is increasingly recognized as a key node in the regulation of hedonic feeding, exerting strong control over reward consumption through its projections to downstream structures. Recent studies showed that one of the primary cellular mediators of these effects are dopamine 1 receptor positive striatal projection neurons (D1-SPNs). Specifically, population D1-SPN activity gets inhibited during reward consumption and such inhibition is necessary and sufficient to authorize reward consumption, independent of metabolic need. Anatomically, the medNAcSh spans a 1.5 mm distance along the rostro-caudal axis in mice and previous studies have reported functional gradients along this axis in behavioral control. For instance, classical pharmacological studies have suggested that rostral rather than caudal medNAcSh regulates appetitive behavior. However, the cellular, circuit, and molecular mechanisms underlying this topographical gradient remain unknown. Here we hypothesized that D1-SPNs contribute to this gradient by regulating hedonic feeding via a specific hotspot in the rostral medNAcSh. Using population level calcium monitoring with fiber photometry in mice, we show that rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs demonstrate inhibitory responses during reward consumption, while caudal D1-SPNs do not. Consistently, optogenetic stimulation of rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs inhibits consumption, while stimulation of caudal D1-SPNs had minimal effects, confirming the existence of a functional rostro-caudal gradient. Importantly, we observed no differences between rostral and caudal D1-SPNs in their behavioral or activity responses to aversive stimuli, suggesting that the D1-SPN gradient is specific to appetitive contexts. To investigate potential molecular correlates of this functional gradient, we leveraged open-source anatomy datasets and performed fluorescent in situ hybridization, identifying Stard5 and Peg10 as markers enriched in the rostral and caudal medNAcSh, respectively. Finally, we developed a novel Stard5-Flp driver mouse line, which allowed us to target the rostral hotspot selectively. We demonstrated that Stard5+ neurons recapitulate activity patterns of rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs. Together, these findings establish a spatially confined rostral subregion of the medNAcSh as a critical regulator of reward consumption and introduce Stard5 as a molecular tool for its manipulation - offering new opportunities for intervention in dysregulated eating beyond classical homeostatic circuits.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Diversity exists throughout biology, playing an important role in maintaining robustness and stability. The same is true of the brain, as has become increasingly apparent in recent years with the accumulation of datasets of unparalleled resolution. These datasets show widespread neural heterogeneity, spanning cells, circuits and system dynamics, marking it as an unavoidable component of the brain's composition. Recent experiments found declines in heterogeneity amongst neurons may accompany pathological states. While heterogeneity has been linked to stability, robustness and increased computational potential, the loss of biophysical diversity was found conducive to the onset of seizure-like activity, suggesting an important functional role. Despite this, how changes in heterogeneity arise remains unknown. Oftentimes considered a static metaparameter resulting from solely genetic disposition, heterogeneity is, in fact, a highly dynamic property of biological networks arising from various sources. Here, we consider this through the lens of intrinsic plasticity, the activity-dependent modulation of neuron biophysical properties, which we propose allows the degree of biophysical diversity to fluctuate in time. Using a network of Poisson neurons endowed with intrinsic plasticity, we combine analytical and numerical approaches to measure the effect of input statistics on the excitability of individual cells, and how this translates into changes in network heterogeneity at the population scale. Our results indicate that, through intrinsic plasticity, diversity in synaptic inputs promotes heterogeneity in cell-to-cell excitability due to changes in the statistics of presynaptic firing rates, and network topology. In contrast, whenever the statistics of synaptic input between cells were too similar, intrinsic plasticity promoted the decline in heterogeneity. Further, we show that changes in heterogeneity can coexist with degeneracy in the firing rate between neurons. Taken together, understanding how input statistics affect neuronal network heterogeneity may provide key insights into brain function resilience and the manipulability of neural diversity through intrinsic plasticity.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

We show that bAIes produces structural ensembles that match a wide range of high- and low-resolution experimental data across diverse systems, achieving accuracy comparable to atomistic molecular dynamics simulations but at a fraction of their computational cost. Furthermore, bAIes outperforms state-of-the-art IDP models based on coarse-grained potentials as well as deep-learning approaches. Our findings pave the way for integrating structural information from modern deep-learning approaches with molecular simulations, advancing ensemble-based understanding of disordered proteins.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

While label-free techniques have generated promising results, achieving high-throughput scProteomics remains a substantial challenge. In this study, we present an approach that increases scProteomics throughput by approximately 30-fold through the true integration of isobaric tags (IBT) with tandem mass tags (TMT), a method we term 'Integral-Hyperplex'. Due to remarkable differences in signal response between TMT16 and IBT16 reporter ions, we implemented two normalization strategies to ensure accurate and integrated quantification: (1) the inclusion of a normalization channel in both IBT and TMT groups to serve as internal standards; and (2) the generation of protein-specific conversion factors between IBT16 and TMT16 signals. We validated the quantification accuracy of the Integral-Hyperplex method by labeling HeLa digests at varying ratios. Furthermore, we demonstrated fully automated labeling on the active-matrix digital microfluidics chip, consuming only 12 nL of labeling reagent per single cell and with a reaction volume as low as 20 nL. Our approach was validated through proof-of-principle quantification experiments across three types of single cells. Approximately 2,000 protein groups were quantified per cell, and the three cell types can be well clustered, confirming the reliability of the Integral-Hyperplex approach. Approximately 300 samples can be analyzed per day due to insufficient resolution of timsTOF SCP. Throughput can be further enhanced using TMT32, additional labeling reagents, and more advanced mass spectrometers such as Orbitrap Astral and timsTOF Ultra 2, and our approach is theoretically capable of analyzing up to ~2,000 single cells per day.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms underlying homeostatic sleep regulation is a central unmet goal of sleep science. Our understanding of such regulation in mammals has required recognizing distinct sleep stages. Drosophila melanogaster is an important genetic model system for understanding sleep. Since the discovery of sleep-like states in the fly 25 years ago, the field has treated sleep as a unitary state consisting of any inactivity lasting 5 minutes or longer, despite convergent work suggesting the existence of multiple sleep stages. Here, we establish that three distinct sleep stages in flies can be classified based on simple inactivity duration criteria. We show that the daily initiation of these sleep stages is temporally distinct, with long sleep occurring immediately following the largest daily period of wakefulness. We show that rebound in response to mechanical sleep deprivation is present only in long sleep and comes at the expense of shorter sleep stages. Deprivation-induced decreases in shorter sleep stages obscure homeostatic sleep rebound when sleep is measured using traditional methods. We observe distinctly timed ultradian oscillations of fly sleep stages, reminiscent of mammalian sleep cycles. Our results indicate that the fields unitary definition of fly sleep has outlived its usefulness and call for the re-examination of sleep regulation in the fly using methods that reflect the unique relationships among sleep stages and their homeostatic and circadian control. The recognition of these sleep stages will be necessary to fully realize the promise of the Drosophila model system for identifying conserved genetic mechanisms underlying such regulation.\n\nSignificanceThe fact that sleep episodes comprise distinct stages in humans and mammalian model systems has been a fundamental discovery in sleep science. This recognition enabled researchers to study the physiological underpinnings of sleep stages and examine the comorbidities and consequences associated with disrupted sleep. The mechanisms underlying sleep homeostasis remain an open problem, and the fruit-fly Drosophila melanogaster continues to be a powerful genetic and neurobiological model to study sleep regulation. Despite recent convergent evidence for distinct sleep stages in the fly, the field continues to treat sleep as a unitary state consisting of any inactivity lasting five minutes or longer. This practice likely obscures important aspects of sleep regulation in the fly, limiting its impact on our understanding of sleep regulation. Inspired by recently developed wearable technologies, which score sleep stages based on motion detection and accelerometry, we asked if distinct fly sleep stages can be identified based on durations of inactivity bouts, and, if so, whether stages of fly sleep are differentially regulated by the two major processes governing sleep: sleep homeostasis and circadian timekeeping. We show that discrete sleep stages can be identified and have distinct relationships amongst each other and to homeostatic sleep regulatory and circadian control centers. Importantly, we find that sleep deprivation produces increases in longer, deeper sleep stages while producing decreases in shorter sleep stages. These opposing responses to deprivation obscure homeostatic sleep responses when the traditional, unitary definition of sleep is used, a reality that has likely hampered the identification of homeostatic regulatory mechanisms in the fly. We concluded that using the simple behavioral criterion we describe here to differentiate sleep stages will be critical for understanding homeostatic and circadian sleep regulation in Drosophila, which remains an important model organism for the discovery of mechanisms of sleep regulation.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Elacridar acts at an early step in the prion infection process, enhancing degradation of newly formed PrPSc. The lysosome is the likely site of elacridars anti-prion effects, based on transcriptomic analysis and the use of functional lysosomal probes.

Despite extensive progress, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of AD remain incompletely understood, partially due to inadequate disease models. To illuminate the earliest changes in hereditary (familial) Alzheimer's disease, we developed an isogenic AD cerebrocortical organoid (CO) model. Our refined methodology produces COs containing excitatory and inhibitory neurons alongside glial cells, utilizing established isogenic wild-type and diseased human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) carrying heterozygous familial AD mutations, namely PSEN1 {Delta}E9/WT, PSEN1M146V/WT, or APPswe/WT. Our CO model reveals time-progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) species, loss of monomeric Tau, and accumulation of aggregated high-molecular-weight (HMW) phospho(p)-Tau species. This is accompanied by neuronal hyperexcitability, as observed in early human AD cases on electroencephalography (EEG), and synapse loss. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analyses reveal significant differences in molecular abnormalities in excitatory vs. inhibitory neurons, helping explain AD clinical phenotypes. Finally, we show that chronic dosing with autophagy activators, including a novel CNS-penetrant mTOR inhibitor-independent drug candidate, normalizes pathologic accumulation of A{beta} and HMW p-Tau, normalizes hyperexcitability, and rescues synaptic loss in COs. Collectively, our results demonstrate these COs are a useful human AD model suitable for assessing early features of familial AD etiology and for testing drug candidates that ameliorate or prevent molecular AD phenotypes.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we integrated chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq), genome-wide occupancy (ChIP-seq) for epigenetic status (H3K27ac) and H3K4me3-anchored chromatin topology (HiChIP) to uncover subtype-independent highly interactive enhancers that interact with essential genes in PDAC.

This is a pertinent question in high dimensional microbiome data, where outliers and overdispersion can distort the performance of a mean-dissimilarity-based test.

M.", "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. CRC tumors exhibit aberrant iron accumulation, which supports tumor cell proliferation through multiple metabolic pathways. However, the oncogenic benefits of elevated iron must be counterbalanced by its potential to catalyze oxidative damage via reactive oxygen species generated from labile, redox-active iron. Ferroptosis is a regulated, non-apoptotic form of cell death characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This process is tightly controlled by the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which reduces lipid peroxides and can be pharmacologically inhibited by agents such as RSL3 and JKE1674. A key source of redox-active iron is the labile iron pool (LIP), yet its role in regulating ferroptosis remains incompletely defined. To examine this, we supplemented CRC cells with exogenous iron following pharmacologic induction of ferroptosis. Iron supplementation significantly reduced cell viability, suggesting that expansion of the LIP potentiates ferroptotic cell death. However, whether ferroptosis is accompanied by dynamic changes in the LIP, and if such changes are mechanistically required for its potentiation, was unknown. To further characterize this response, we profiled the expression of iron regulatory genes under ferroptotic conditions and observed no change in transcriptional response in iron homeostasis genes. When using a fluorescent probe for labile iron, we found that the LIP did not measurably increase during ferroptosis induction. These findings suggest that the LIP itself does not expand after the initiation of ferroptosis to become the primary driver of ferroptotic potentiation.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

However, when the same working memory task is repeated over several days, it raises the question of whether the rule or task set becomes automated (or proceduralized). The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is crucial for working memory. Yet, the role of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in the automation (proceduralization) of rules or task sets remains to be clarified. Using a longitudinal approach of the delay non-match to place (DNMP) task in a T-maze combined to silencing the mPFC or DLS in mice, we show that the mPFC becomes less critical in the maintenance phase of the task as behaviour progressively shifts toward automation. During this phase, the DLS facilitates automated processing. Accordingly, silencing the DLS during maintenance of the task triggers an adaptation in learning strategies, reactivating a goal-directed behaviour. Our findings strengthen the view that memory traces result from a dynamic reorganization of neural networks, challenging the classical view that information merely migrates between brain structures. We here propose that the memory trace remains in a dormant state less energy-consuming for the system while still allowing for rapid flexibility in case of task modification.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

One approach to target these channels, is to manipulate the membrane charge which involves the use of wireless bipolar electrodes such as carbon nanotube porins (CNTPs), which could be inserted into cell membranes to mimic these channels, to provide a novel bioelectronic method for modulating cancer cell behavior by mimicking io. By utilizing membrane dyes, we observed alterations in Vmem induced by CNTPs and externally applied electric fields. Analyses of cellular behaviors and processes indicated that Vmem is more receptive to stimuli in invasive cancers, while it leads to increased metabolism in less invasive cancers, with notable changes in the cell cycle occurring at approximately 48 hours post-treatment in GBM cell lines.

To uncover the molecular basis of toxin resistance in the black-headed grosbeak (Pheuticus melanocephalus), a specialist predator of cardiotonic steroid-defended monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), we investigated the evolution of target-site insensitivity in the toxin's molecular target--the Na,K-ATPase. Functional assays of engineered Na,K-ATPases revealed that resistance in grosbeaks arises from a non-additive interaction between a substitution at position 111 (Q111E) and up to six nearby amino acid changes in the first extracellular loop of the protein. Using resurrected ancestral proteins, we show that the earliest of these six substitutions to evolve (V113L) altered the functional effects of Q222E, such that Q111E alone became maladaptive. Only after the accumulation of additional permissive substitutions could Q111E confer resistance, highlighting how intramolecular epistatic interactions and historical contingency constrained the evolutionary path to adaptation. Our phylogenetic analysis of Na,K-ATPase sequences from 360 birds further revealed that several of the specific grosbeak substitutions--particularly at sites 112, 114, and 116--show strong signatures of co-evolution with changes at site 111 across the avian tree, supporting the hypothesis that resistance evolves through repeated, interacting changes.

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by such fungi act as semiochemicals that inhibit pathogens, with VOC production influenced by physical interactions between competing fungi. This study explores the interaction between the beneficial soil fungus Trichoderma hamatum GD12 strain (GD12), previously shown to antagonize crop pathogens such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, to test the hypothesis that its antagonistic effect is mediated by volatile chemical signalling. A GD12 mutant deficient in the chitinolytic enzyme N-acetyl-{beta}-glucosaminidase {Delta}Thnag::hph, which shows reduced biocontrol activity, was also examined. RESULTS: In dual-culture confrontation assays, co-inoculation of GD12 and S. sclerotiorum led to fungistatic interactions after 7 days, whereas {Delta}Thnag::hph showed no antagonism, indicating a loss of antagonistic function. VOCs collected from individual and co-cultures were analysed by gas chromatography - flame ionization detector (GC-FID) analysis and coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), revealing significant differences in VOC production between treatments, with VOC production notably upregulated in the GD12 + S. sclerotiorum co-culture. Peak production of 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one occurred 17 days post-inoculation. This upregulation was absent in the {Delta}Thnag::hph co-culture, suggesting VOCs may drive antagonism. Synthetic VOC assays revealed several compounds inhibitory to S. sclerotiorum, including 1-octen-3-one, which also arrested the growth of key fungal pathogens (Botrytis cinerea, Pyrenopeziza brassicae, and Gaeumannomyces tritici). Structural insights into 1-octen-3-one's antifungal activity against S. sclerotiorum are also presented.

Methods: We performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) on explanted lungs from a German (n=23) and a French cohort (n=17) of PPFE patients, and controls (n=16). Identified cell populations were localized by immunofluorescence and multiplex RNA in-situ hybridization.

We recently demonstrated that disruption of formate dehydrogenase (FDH) in K. phaffii allows endogenous formate, derived from tetrahydrofolate (THF)-mediated C1 metabolism, to induce pAOX1 without addition of external inducers. Building on this, we hypothesized that increasing intracellular formate production by enhancing serine biosynthesis could further improve promoter induction and rProt productivity. Overexpression of SER3, encoding 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme in serine synthesis, significantly increased pAOX1-driven expression of an intracellular reporter protein (eGFP) and secreted glucose oxidase (Gox) from Aspergillus niger, without compromising cell fitness. Enhanced formate accumulation and stronger pAOX1 induction were observed in both micro- and bioreactor cultivations using sorbitol or glycerol-sorbitol mixtures. In bioprocess conditions, SER3 overexpression led to a 30% increase in specific Gox activity compared to the parental FdhKO strain.

Six distinct phenotypes emerged, capturing both sleep timing (early birds, typical sleepers, night owls) and adherence patterns (high, medium- high, inconsistent, fragmented, and non-adherent). The approach leverages routinely collected clinical data without the need for additional sensors, promising significant benefits for personalized sleep medicine.

Although only few pathways have been completely investigated to date, their characterization paves the way for exploring the potential effects of specialized metabolites on plant physiology. Among them is the linear furanocoumarin pathway, which was recently completed to produce up to psoralen. In this study, we report the first metabolic engineering of the linear furanocoumarin pathway to enable artificial psoralen production in tomato, through the integration of four genes coding for the enzymes: Umbelliferone Synthase, Demethylsuberosin Synthase, Marmesin Synthase and Psoralen Synthase. Interestingly, coumarins were produced instead of furanocoumarins. Using morphophysiological, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses, we suggest how coumarins, particularly scopoletin, can impact growth and affect plant physiology, even at low concentrations. As coumarins have increasingly attracted interest for agricultural applications due to their minimal environmental impact, this work both expands and challenges their potential by highlighting the physiological costs and benefits they may impose on tomato.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

When coupled with the increasing incidence of drought driven by climate change, the co-occurrence of these biotic and abiotic pressures imposes a complex challenge for crop resilience. In this study, we explored the molecular responses of soybean (Glycine max) to concurrent water limitation and ASR infection through an integrative analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic datasets. To capture both linear and conditional relationships among molecular features, we employed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) alongside Copula Graphical Models (CGMs). WGCNA identified 17 gene co-expression modules exhibiting significant correlations with 27 annotated metabolites. Among these, abscisic acid showed consistent associations with drought-responsive modules enriched in central metabolic pathways and transcription factors such as Dof and bHLH. In contrast, modules linked to fungal infection were correlated with dipeptides and D-galacturonic acid, implicating early defense signaling and cell wall remodeling. The CGM framework further revealed sparse, condition-specific networks of differentially expressed genes and metabolites directly associated with each stressor, including genes encoding a dirigent-like protein, pentatricopeptide repeat proteins, and a nucleoredoxin, as well as metabolites such as inosine, Epi-dihydrophaseic acid and 2-oxoadipic acid. Notably, no gene or metabolite was found to be directly responsive to both stresses, underscoring the modular and stress-specific architecture of soybean defense. Together, these results highlight a hierarchical regulatory structure and demonstrate the value of combining correlation-based and dependency-driven models to identify candidate targets for multi-stress resilience breeding.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

D.; Sork, V. L.", "abstract": "Drought stress is a strong selective pressure for all plant species. Plants can respond to water shortage through various strategies that confer drought tolerance, but with a potential cost for growth. These strategies may be plastic responses that occur with the onset of stress or may comprise continuously-expressed (constitutive) traits regardless of water availability. Here, we used RNA-Seq to characterize transcriptional responses to dehydration in seedlings of a drought tolerant oak, Quercus douglasii from a population in the Sierra Nevada Foothills in California. In the greenhouse, we subjected 24 seedlings from six maternal families to dry-down or well-watered treatments and prepared RNA libraries from tissue collected before and after each treatment (48 libraries). Our goals were to characterize the pattern of up- and down-regulated genes in response to dehydration and to assess the extent to which this drought tolerant species shows differential versus constitutive expression as a drought response strategy. We identified few differentially expressed genes in response to dehydration. Up-regulated genes were related to known drought response functions, while down-regulated genes were enriched for gene ontology terms related to growth and carbohydrate metabolism. We discovered high constitutive expression of many putatively drought-responsive genes that had been found to exhibit gene expression plasticity in a drought sensitive oak, which a novel finding for drought tolerance strategies in tree species. We conclude that the drought tolerant strategy of Q. douglasii incorporates high constitutive expression levels of drought-responsive genes, as well as some plasticity in its response once environmental stress is experienced.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Zimbabwe, with its five floristic regions, hosts substantial plant biodiversity, yet a comprehensive national inventory of its CWRs has been lacking. This study presents a desk-based assessment to develop a national checklist of Zimbabwean CWRs, applying a conceptual framework that evaluates edible CWRs in terms of taxonomic composition, use categories, biogeographic status, extinction risk, breeding potential, and vernacular nomenclature. An integrated approach combining floristic, ecological, and ethnobotanical data was employed to contextualize their utility in food systems and conservation. Findings reveal that Zimbabwe harbors over 2,700 CWR taxa across more than 100 plant families and nearly 400 genera, related to approximately 260 cultivated crops. Documented uses span food, fodder, medicine, ornamental, and industrial applications, with edible uses comprising nearly 40% of taxa with recorded utility. Edible CWRs span 53 families, predominantly Orchidaceae, Poaceae, Fabaceae, Convolvulaceae, Lamiaceae, and Euphorbiaceae, and serve diverse dietary roles including vegetables, fruits, spices, herbs, cereals, oils, and beverages. Around 90% CWR are native, and one-third are regionally endemic, with the Eastern Highlands region identified as a biodiversity hotspot. Despite their significance, only 30% of edible CWRs have been assessed for extinction risk, and just 0.2% have documented confirmed or potential traits for crop improvement. Vernacular names were recorded in six local languages for 26% of edible taxa, highlighting significant cultural knowledge and integration into local food systems. This study underscores the underutilized potential of edible CWRs in plant breeding and conservation planning. Their diversity, cultural embeddedness, and adaptive traits present significant opportunities for enhancing food security and advancing sustainable development in Zimbabwe and beyond. Strategic conservation and utilization of these genetic resources are urgently needed.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

The present study evaluated the validity of the statistical learning model proposed to explain language difficulties in children with SLI. To this end, two auditory paradigms of varying complexity, framed within predictive coding theory, were passively presented to children diagnosed with SLI and without neurological impairments. The paradigms consisted of stimulus sequences with decreasing or increasing frequencies, interspersed with the sporadic occurrence of unexpected tone endings. The psychophysiological response was recorded using EEG, focusing on the P1, Mismatch Negativity (MMN), Post-imperative Negative Variation PINV, and Contingent Negative Variation (CNV) components. Results showed an absent MMN and a higher P1 response to deviant tones in children with SLI, suggesting an impaired development of frontal MMN generators, possibly compensated by the primary auditory cortex. SLI participants also showed increased PINV and CNV responses during the most complex paradigm, which could imply greater cognitive effort and resource allocation to the reassessment of stimulus patterns in this group. Finally, the incomplete maturation of frontal areas in children of this age range (3 to 11 years old) was proposed to explain the increased activity observed in both groups for the N1/MMN elicited in the simplest paradigm. These findings support statistical learning as a valid model for understanding the possible neural basis of SLI, identifying this type of predictive EEG design as a potential early detection protocol.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

To date, a substantial body of literature has suggested reduced size of subcortical regions and abnormal functional connectivity in frontal and default mode networks linked to depression. However, recent meta analyses have failed to identify significant converging correlates of depression across the literature such that a conclusive mapping of the neuroimaging correlates of depression remains elusive. Here we leveraged 23,417 participants across six datasets to comprehensively establish the neuroimaging correlates of depression. We found reductions in gray matter volume/ cortical surface area associated with depression in the frontal cortex, anterior cingulate and insula, confirming prior studies showing the importance of prefrontal and default mode regions in depression. Our findings demonstrate multiple surprising results including a lack of depression correlates in subcortical brain regions, significant depression correlates in somatomotor and visual regions, and limited functional connectivity findings. Overall, these results shed new light on key brain regions involved in the pathophysiology of depression, updating our understanding of the neuroimaging correlates of depression. We anticipate that these insights will inform further research into the role of sensorimotor and visual regions in depression and into the impact of heterogeneity on functional connectivity correlates of depression.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

In autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), characterized by cognitive rigidity and atypical use of prior information - favoring immediate sensory input over predictive cues - entrainment to temporally variable input may be reduced at both neural and behavioral levels, though the neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we recorded high-density EEG and behavior in adults with ASD (n=20) and neurotypical (NT) controls (n=21) during a visual detection task with four rhythmic structures, parametrically varied from an isochronous fully regular rhythm, to a highly irregular one. Spectral analysis and temporal response function (TRF) models revealed significantly reduced modulation by temporal regularity in ASD, particularly in mildly jittered stimulation streams. Additionally, the coupling between phases of neural oscillations and behavior was diminished in ASD under the jittered conditions, suggesting reduced functional relevance of neural synchronization. Residual spectral power post-stimulation showed lower oscillatory entrainment in ASD, ruling out simple evoked-response explanations. Notably, the degree of neural modulation by temporal regularity was correlated with IQ within the ASD group, suggesting a link between temporal flexibility and individual cognitive profiles. These findings highlight impaired neural entrainment and reduced behavioral modulation by temporal structure in ASD, offering insight into inflexible responses to uncertain, volatile sensory environments.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Evidence has consistently linked striatal dopamine to timing behaviors, but it is still uncertain how rapid changes in dopamine may modulate human time perception. Many tasks designed to measure time perception utilize instrumental conditioning paradigms that reinforce correctly timed intervals. In these tasks, subjects are shown to improve their performance following repeated presentations of temporal cues, a phenomenon known as temporal learning. We sought to determine the association between rapid changes in human dopamine levels and temporal learning on an interval timing task that tested the reproduction of 1000ms, 3000ms, and 5000ms intervals in the presence and absence of monetary reinforcement. We utilized human voltammetry to measure real-time dopamine concentrations from the striatum of patients with Parkinsons disease while they performed the interval timing task. We first compared task behavior between patients with Parkinsons disease and neurologically healthy controls and found significant differences in the reproduction of 1000ms intervals, but not 3000ms or 5000ms intervals of time. Further, we observed that during 1000ms intervals, increases in striatal dopamine concentrations were associated with increases in temporal errors, but only during the expectation of monetary reinforcement. We also demonstrated that as temporal errors decrease overtime during temporal learning, so do striatal dopamine concentrations. These results suggest that dopamine may be driving temporal learning through the generation of temporal errors in response to positive reinforcement. These findings may have significant implications in our understanding of the role that dopamine plays in time perception.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "Serotonergic psychedelics are known for their profound effects on consciousness and are gaining renewed interest as potential psychiatric treatments. These advances underscore the need to clarify the mechanisms of action of these compounds. This systematic review compiles and critically evaluates 23 in vitro and 26 in vivo electrophysiological studies on psychedelic compounds, with an emphasis on layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex, where 5-HT2A receptors are densely expressed. Our findings reveal that psychedelics exert complex, heterogeneous effects on neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, and network oscillations. These results challenge the simplified view that psychedelics uniformly increase cortical excitability. Instead, they modulate both excitatory and inhibitory processes in a cell-type- and compartment-specific manner, with evidence for biphasic, dose-dependent, and context-sensitive responses. Activation of 5-HT2A receptors leads to intricate calcium signaling, downregulating excitatory currents and firing rates in many neurons, while enhancing glutamate release and activating a subset of projection fibers. Modulation of presynaptic and extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors appears central to these effects, and some indirect evidence supports the involvement of intracellular 5-HT2A receptors. These insights prompt a reassessment of prevailing models of psychedelic action and underscore the value of incorporating electrophysiological data into psychedelic neuropharmacology.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

We also examined if the anti-Vi polysaccharide antibodies present in the typhoid-recovered participants' plasma had an activating effect on NK cells isolated from healthy individuals. Methods: ELISA was used to measure the antibody responses to the five S. Typhi antigens in plasma samples from typhoid-recovered individuals and healthy participants. Vi polysaccharide specific plasma antibodies were tested for activation of the NK cells isolated from the healthy participants. Results: Polysaccharide antigens mounted better IgA responses among typhoid recovered individuals as compared to healthy individuals. Anti-S. Typhi IgM was significantly elevated in the typhoid group for all five antigens (p<0.05). No significant differences were seen in IgG responses. Notably, healthy participants also exhibited considerable levels of antibodies to all the antigens, indicating background seroreactivity. Conclusion: Polysaccharide antigens elicited significantly better IgA responses in recovered typhoid participants, possibly reflecting mucosal immune priming from the gut. Presence of IgM antibodies in recovered participants suggest a durable IgM response after Typhoid. Similar levels of IgG in both the groups may indicate waning IgG levels towards the baseline post-infection. These findings highlight the complexity of the immune response against S.

The majority of symptomatic malaria cases are restricted to the short high transmission period that follows the rainy season. Shortly after, persistent asymptomatic malaria cases are more prevalent throughout the prolonged low transmission period. It is still unclear whether host metabolic alterations play a role in asymptomatic infections during seasonal malaria. In this study, we analyzed the blood plasma metabolome (n=199) of individuals in The Gambia, West Africa, capturing data from both high and low malaria transmission periods. Plasma samples from individuals (n=16) were collected monthly throughout the low transmission season, enabling a longitudinal analysis of metabolic alternations over six months. Our findings reveal that significant changes in host plasma metabolite composition are associated with seasonality and malaria pathogenicity. Notably, we observed elevated levels of taurine in asymptomatic malaria infections, especially during periods of low transmission. In vitro, this naturally occurring host molecule inhibits the cytoadhesion of malaria-infected red blood cells (iRBCs), which is key to malaria disease severity and mortality. Exogenous taurine can significantly reduce or reverse binding of iRBCs to the common adhesion receptor CD36 and the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), the later being associated with cerebral malaria. This study uncovers a mechanism by which elevated taurine plasma levels in subclinical infections could reduce cytoadhesion and lead to increased splenic clearance, thereby strengthening host resistance to symptomatic infections. In the absence of health strategies targeting dry season parasite reservoirs, our findings highlight taurine as a potential prophylactic or therapeutic agent to reduce symptomatic malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

For plant-arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, a notoriously difficult system, our model pinpointed a regulatory network by identifying 27 core plant-AM symbiosis genes among its top 50 candidate OGs, including the critical receptor SYMRK. The approach also proved highly effective for identifying functional genes related to the tested vertebrate skeletal development and multiple bacterial traits. Most notably, for bacterial motility, our model not only identified 63 known motility genes from the top 100 candidate OGs (of which 78 are present in Escherichia coli) but also guided the experimental validation of three novel essential genes.

To investigate how abscission is spatially and temporally regulated during reproduction, we analyzed five sequential abscission events in the cherry species Prunus yedoensis and Prunus sargentii: abscission of the petals, calyces, flower pedicels, fruit pedicels, and peduncles. The abscission zone (AZ) of the calyx formed de novo upon activation, whereas other AZs were pre-formed but developmentally arrested. Localized ethylene responsiveness reactivated these zones, promoting cell division, differentiation of residuum and secession cells on either side of the AZ, and lignin deposition in some cases. This progression was accompanied by reactive oxygen species accumulation and pH shifts. We observed species-specific differences during early floral abscission: P. yedoensis shed petals rapidly in a pollination-independent manner, whereas P. sargentii retained petals on unpollinated flowers, which later abscised with the pedicel, potentially extending the fertilization window. Both species employed a post-fertilization checkpoint via fruit pedicel abscission to selectively eliminate small, slow-growing fruits. These findings reveal that Prunus species coordinate a hierarchical abscission program functioning as a multilayered reproductive filter, progressively refining investment decisions to determine the final fruit set.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

The aim of this experiment was to analyze the effect of photoperiod on the early development of seasonal flowering and everbearing strawberry plants, and to compare the expression of genes known or suspected to be involved in the regulation of plant development between the two flowering types. Young, runner-propagated seasonal flowering and everbearing strawberry plants were grown under 10, 12, 14, or 16 h photoperiod in a climate-controlled vertical farm. Morphological and physiological measurements were made weekly. Leaf material was collected for gene expression analysis. There were not many differences in plant growth and development between the short day conditions (10 and 12 h photoperiods), or long day conditions (14 and 16 h photoperiods). Short day conditions had a repressive effect on vegetative growth in all cultivars, but this effect was reduced in everbearing cultivars compared to seasonal flowering cultivars. No notable differences were found in gene expression between the two flowering types.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Background: Plasmodium vivax poses a major obstacle to malaria elimination because it can lie dormant in the liver for weeks or months before reactivating and causing a relapse of infection. These dormant forms (hypnozoites) cannot be detected using standard diagnostics, but recent P. vivax exposure and by proxy, hypnozoite carriage, can be inferred using antibody-based tests (serological markers). In this study, we examined how genetic variation in P. vivax affects the utility of these antibody markers, and whether redesigned antigens could improve performance. Methods: We analysed global P. vivax genetic data to assess variation in leading serological markers. Based on this, we produced new antigen versions (haplotypes) that better reflect global sequence diversity, compared to the commonly used reference strain (Sal-1). Antibody responses against these new constructs were then tested using samples from well-characterised cohorts in Brazil and Thailand. Antibody levels were assessed in relation to how recently participants had a qPCR-detectable blood-stage P. vivax infection. We compared the ability of the haplotypes and reference constructs to correctly identify individuals infected within the prior 9-months. Findings: Extensive genetic diversity was identified in two P. vivax antigens, DBPII and MSP5. Several antigens had large numbers of circulating haplotypes globally, with the percentage with similar sequence identity to the reference Sal-1 ranging from 0.4% (MSP5) to 99% (S16). Two antigens exhibited strong differences in immunogenicity by region and construct (RBP2a and DBPII). However, for most proteins (5 out of 8), these differences had little impact on the accuracy of identifying recent exposure. In cases where performance was affected (e.g. RBP2a), this could be overcome by adding multiple antigens into the classification model. Interpretation: Even highly diverse antigens can be effective serological exposure markers. Our findings highlight the importance of testing the impact of genetic diversity when designing serological tests and suggest practical strategies, such as using a mix of antigens, to ensure consistent performance across regions.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

The genus Talaromyces is known for its species' ability to produce a diverse group of antimicrobial compounds. For example, T. trachyspermus has been reported to produce secondary metabolites, cell wall-degrading enzymes, and plant growth-promoting factors. Identification of novel promising metabolites and enzymes from T. trachyspermus is still in its infancy. Also, there is a lack of information about the genomic resources for its secondary metabolites and hydrolytic enzymes. Therefore, this study aimed to analyse the genome of a biocontrol isolate of this species to investigate its biocontrol mechanisms at the genomic level, focusing on secondary metabolites and cell wall degrading enzymes. The whole genome of T. trachyspermus isolate IRAN 3054C, obtained from necrotic Orobanch ramosa stems in Iran with biocontrol ability, was sequenced using the Illumina platform. We performed both de novo and resequencing analyses of the genome, obtaining a 31.3 Mb assembly. The abundance of protein groups associated with biocontrol activities was assessed in the studied genome. Fungismash was used to detect and annotate secondary metabolites. The analysis revealed the presence of several secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters (BGCs), with a high frequency of polyketide synthases (T1PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), which are known to produce bioactive compounds with antimicrobial properties. Among the identified secondary metabolites, Fusarin, YWA1, Dimethylcoprogen, and Squalestatin S1 exhibited the highest similarity to known compounds. Furthermore, sequences similar to Phyllostictine A/B and Cornexistin indicate potential herbicidal properties. The genome also had domains for enzymes involved in phosphate solubilisation, siderophore production, and fungal cell wall degradation, which are essential for biocontrol and plant growth promotion. Our findings highlight the genomic richness of T. trachyspermus IRAN 3054C for biocontrol.

E. Z.; Navarro, L.; Martinon-Torres, F.; Gomez-Carballa, A.; Salas, A.", "abstract": "Saliva-based RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) poses technical challenges due to high bacterial content, RNA degradation, and sample heterogeneity. This study investigates the transcriptional effects of music exposure in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using this non-invasive approach. To address saliva-specific limitations, we employed two complementary library preparation methods, Poly-A selection and Human-Enriched protocols, allowing us to maximize human transcript detection and ensure reproducibility. By merging them, we ensured reproducibility and captured both host and microbial signals. While each dataset individually revealed a limited number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), their integration enhanced biological resolution. Among the consistently modulated genes were HERC6, TSPAN5, and REM2, pointing to music-induced transcriptional changes relevant to neurodevelopmental and immune processes. Functional enrichment analyses highlighted pathways involved in immune regulation, oxidative phosphorylation, and epithelial differentiation. These findings align with evidence of immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered cellular communication in ASD. Importantly, co-expression network analysis identified modules significantly correlated with music exposure. Notably, the AKNA module, previously associated with ASD risk, was downregulated and enriched for Ras-related GTPase signaling and immune pathways, suggesting that music may modulate intracellular signaling and inflammation. Conversely, upregulation of the UBE2D3 module pointed to activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress response mechanisms, a known contributor to ASD neurodevelopmental deficits. These results suggest that music engages specific stress-adaptive and immunomodulatory networks in buccal cells, potentially reflecting systemic effects. Our exploratory metagenomic analysis highlights 15 microbial species with consistent abundance shifts across both methods. Notably, Acidipropionibacterium acidipropionici and Propionibacterium freudenreichii, associated with propionic acid production, emerged as music-responsive taxa. Elevated propionic acid has been implicated in ASD-like behaviors and neuroinflammation, suggesting a microbiota-mediated pathway. Music may influence both host gene expression and oral microbiota, potentially affecting neuroimmune processes via the microbiota-brain axis. Although exploratory, the results support the feasibility of using saliva for integrated molecular profiling in ASD.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that an effector from the potato late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans bridges the host protein NbTOL9a, a putative member of the host ESCRT pathway, to a helper NLR to suppress immunity. In this work, we solved the crystal structure of the RXLR-LWY effector AVRcap1b in complex with the ENTH domain of NbTOL9a. The structure revealed that unlike other RXLR-LWY effectors, AVRcap1b has a novel L-shaped fold and defines a new structural family of effectors in the Phytophthora genus. Moreover, we defined the AVRcap1b/NbTOL9a binding interface and designed effector mutants that don't bind NbTOL9a, impairing immune suppression. This indicates that ENTH binding is required for full virulence activity of this effector. Lastly, we show that AVRcap1b associates specifically with activated NbNRC2 independently of NbTOL9a binding. This suggests that the effector functions as a bridge that interconnects NbNRC2 with the NbTOL9a pathway. These results illustrate an unprecedented pathogen mechanism to hijack helper NLR pathways and suppress immunity.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Cumulative evidence suggests the contribution of cell cycle regulation in repairing PNI injury, and p27KIP1 is a key molecule in regulating the cell cycle. Objective: The aim of this study is to elucidate the repair mechanism of peripheral nerve injury (PNI) from the point of view of regulating cell cycle and to explore the therapeutic effect of Buyang Huanwu Decoction (BHD). To provide new strategies for the treatment of PNI and to explore valuable drugs initially. Methods: The clamp injury model was chose as a PNI model and different doses of BHD extract were administered by gavage for 14 days. Limb motor function, sciatic nerve index and sciatic nerve pathology were assessed and p27Kip expression level was determined. The in vivo chemical composition of BHD extract was determined and drug targets were retrieved by TCMSP, STITCH and Swiss Target Prediction to predict the mechanism of BHD treatment for PNI using network pharmacology. Pathway-related proteins including P-PI3K, P-AKT, P-mTOR and HIF-1a were validated by western blotting assay. Results: Compared with control rats, PNI rats had abnormal motor function, sciatic nerve damage and reduced p27Kip expression. Administration of BHD for 14 days significantly improved PNI in rats, which not only repaired sciatic nerve function, attenuated sciatic nerve pathology and inhibited p27Kip expression to regulate the cell cycle in PNI rats, but also activated the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1a pathway. Conclusion: The above results suggest that PI3K/AKT/mTOR/HIF-1a mediated cell cycle regulation may be an important repair mechanism for PNI, and that BHD can improve PNI by accelerating the cell cycle to promote neural repair and regeneration.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

To assess this strategy in melanoma, we performed a high throughput microscopy-based senescence screen utilizing a panel of melanoma cell lines with different driver mutations and a collection of clinical and experimental drugs. We found that vemurafenib and trametinib, which inhibit BRAFV600E and MEK1/2, respectively, induced senescence in some but not all BRAF-mutant cell lines. In contrast, palbociclib, BKM-120 and crizotinib, which inhibit CDK4/6, PI3K, and MET/ALK/ROS1, respectively, triggered senescence in most cell lines, irrespective of BRAF/NRAS mutation status, and overcame intrinsic and acquired vemurafenib resistance. The combination of palbociclib and crizotinib synergized to further enhance the senescence response in all cell lines irrespective of BRAF/NRAS mutation status, increased the expression of SASP factors, such as IL-1a and b, and HLA class I and other markers for recognition by NK and T cells. Further, this combination caused a significant increase in CD8+ T cells and pro-inflammatory macrophages in the tumor microenvironment and a marked reduction of mouse melanoma tumor growth that was dependent on CD8+ T cells, suggesting increased immune surveillance.

Here we first investigated whether Phoenixin, a novel peptide acting in the reproductive pathway of vertebrates, is the hormone that has replaced Gnrh in zebrafish. While loss of function of the phoenixin gene affected female differentiation, we observed no defects in fertility. We next reconsidered the GnRH pathway and turned to the natural world, where fishes use waterborne hormones to control reproduction. Thus, we investigated whether exogenous Gnrh affects the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Here we show that fish isolated from their conspecifics and kept in artificial water devoid of fish odors, mounted sex appropriate pituitary responses when Gnrh was added to the water. Furthermore, blocking the access of water to the olfactory organs eliminated these responses. We then analyzed Gnrh signaling by knocking out the gene encoding gnrh-receptor3 (gnrh-r3) and, surprisingly, found that fish homozygous for a gnrh-r3 null mutation were almost completely infertile: males did not produce sperm and females produced but a few mature oocytes. Finally, we found that Gnrh was present in nanomolar concentrations in the water that houses the fish, thus supporting the hypothesis that waterborne Gnrh from conspecifics plays a key role in regulating zebrafish reproduction in the absence of the endogenous ligand.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have suggested the importance of inflammation in the healing process in both acute and chronic tendon injury. However, there remain gaps in knowledge that hinder progress in the development of therapeutics to improve healing. A more complete characterization of the inflammatory response in tendon is needed, by defining the relative roles of different molecular pathways, and determining how these pathways interact with tendon mechanobiology. To investigate these questions, an in vitro model was developed, wherein the complexity of the in vivo healing environment was simulated by applying M1 macrophage conditioned media (M1-CM) to tendon fibroblasts (TFs). Characterization of the M1-CM and its effect on TFs revealed a robust inflammatory response, including upregulation of over 500 genes and increased secretion of several cytokines in TFs. The NF-{kappa}{beta} and JAK/STAT signaling pathways were necessary for the response to M1-CM, and each pathway was responsible for different downstream responses to inflammation in TFs. When considering the role of mechanical loading in tendon responses to inflammation, it was found that TF responses to loading were altered by the presence of an inflammatory stimulus. Analysis of the genes that responded differently to loading with inflammation present suggested changes in pathways involving extracellular matrix organization and G protein signaling. Mathematical modeling based upon these results revealed time-dependent suppression of mechanosensitivity, suggesting that therapeutic timing of inflammatory or anti-inflammatory interventions could restore or attenuate mechanical responsiveness to modulate rehabilitation outcomes.

Bats consistently engage in overhead motion during flight, subjecting their shoulders to substantial loading throughout their relatively long lifespan. Remarkably, despite the demands placed on a bat's shoulder, instability and rotator cuff tears, which could be fatal to bats in short order, are not observed in nature. We were thus inspired to study functional adaptations in the shoulders of bats that enable this overhead motion. Comparative anatomical studies of the shoulders of bats and mice, similarly-sized quadrupeds, were performed and interpreted using a mathematical model. Scapular anatomy indicated a more prominent role for the infraspinatus muscle in the bat compared to the mouse. Measurements of bat and mice shoulders revealed that the bat glenoid had a larger curvature and arc length than that of mice, providing a larger articulating surface area with and deeper enclosing surface of the humeral head. Modeling results predicted that the bat shoulder is stable over a dramatically larger range of angles compared to the mouse shoulder. These results suggested that adaptations to constraints imposed by the bony anatomy and rotator cuff tendons of the shoulder may contribute to the ability of bats to sustain overhead motion in a high stress, repeated loading environment without injury. Results suggest that bats have evolved unique adaptations in their glenohumeral bony anatomy that reduce stress on the supraspinatus, enhance joint stability, and optimize strength across a broad range of motion.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Based on prior evidence, this study tested the hypotheses that (1) community-level disadvantage would relate independently of individual-level socioeconomic position to white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), which reflect subclinical brain pathology that may presage later dementia; and (2) this association would be partly explained by blood pressure, cardiometabolic risk, and/or systemic levels of inflammation. These hypotheses were examined among otherwise healthy middle- and older-aged adults without clinical dementia at testing. Methods: Participants were 388 adults aged 40-72 years (53% female; 12% non-White) whose street addresses were entered into the Neighborhood Atlas to compute Area Deprivation Index scores by census block. Participants also underwent high resolution (7 Tesla) brain imaging to assess total WMH volume normalized for intracranial volume, and assessment of blood pressure, cardiometabolic (adiposity, lipids, glucose and insulin), and inflammatory (interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein) risk factors. Results: Linear regression models showed that higher community deprivation on the ADI associated with greater WMH volume, independently of age, sex, years of education and smoking. This association was largely independent of blood pressure, cardiometabolic risk and systemic inflammation. Conclusion: The present novel findings add to growing evidence that community disadvantage relates to preclinical neurodegenerative changes, which may contribute to accelerated brain and cognitive aging. Future work is warranted to better understand pathways that link residential environments to brain health and to identify targets for community and public policy interventions.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

We demonstrate that TRIM28 interacts with the spliceosomal protein USP39 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, with non-phosphorylated TRIM28 promoting USP39 SUMOylation at defined lysine residues. This post-translational modification enhances USP39's role within the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complex. Functionally, TRIM28 knockdown induces widespread alterations in alternative splicing patterns, underscoring its importance in splicing regulation.

In a series of functional assays, we uncovered a mechanistic link between estrogenic signals and NOD2-deficiency phenotypes, whereby exposure to estrogen alone replicated NOD2-deficiency phenotypes, and exposure to an estrogen receptor antagonist reverted the epithelial defects observed in NOD2 mutants.

Initial remission rates vary from 30-80% with current therapies, but relapses are common. The 5-year survival is 30% overall but less than 10% for those 60 years of age or older. Resistance to current therapies is the central clinical challenge. This study investigated how age influences the AML proteome in patients with increasing age. We analyzed bone marrow or leukapheresis samples from 14 AML patients, including 9 older ([&ge;] 66 years) and 5 younger ([&le;] 58 years) individuals, using proteomic technologies (Data-Independent Acquisitions, DIA-MS). We identified 4,471 protein groups, of which 889 exhibited significant changes and regulation between the two age groups. Proteins upregulated in older patients were predominantly associated with DNA transcription and translation, while downregulated proteins were linked to metabolic, catabolic, and extracellular matrix or structural processes. Significant changes in older samples affected the splicing machinery. Significant alterations in several of these factors, suggests either dysregulated or elevated splicing activity and reduced transcription initiation factor activity in older AML patients. Our study provides novel insights into molecular changes during AML arising in the older adult, highlighting the importance of age-specific therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Reproductive systems are particularly sensitive to diet and energetic state, yet the long-term reproductive consequences of overnutrition are poorly defined. Here, we used Caenorhabditis elegans to study the impacts of glucose excess on reproductive aging. Glucose supplementation shortens C. elegans lifespan, and we found that it also hastens age-related reproductive decline, evidenced by a greater deterioration in oocyte quality and lower fertility with age. We next evaluated insulin-like signaling contributions, as this glucose-responsive pathway is well known to regulate both somatic aging and reproductive aging. Intriguingly, while 20 mM glucose enrichment still shortens the lifespan of daf-2(e1370) mutants, we found that it had no detrimental impact on their reproductive aging phenotypes. Using auxin-induced tissue-selective degradation, we discovered that DAF-2/insulin-like receptor signaling in C. elegans intestine and body wall musculature is required for glucose enrichment to exert damaging impacts on the reproductive system. However, suppressing insulin-like signaling in either of these tissues is sufficient to protect C. elegans against glucose-induced reproductive aging.

Residential CD4 T cells, regulatory T cells, B cells, and NK cells have been demonstrated to share phenotypic properties with residential CD8 T cells, but the migratory kinetics are even more poorly defined. Here we used probabilistic modelling on a large parabiosis dataset, covering multiple time-points and tissues, to calculate migration kinetics and dwell times of multiple lymphocyte subsets across a diverse set of tissues. Markov chain modelling identified distinct cell type-specific and tissue-specific residency patterns. The liver and gut were prone to prolonged residency compared to other tissue types, and a hierarchy of residency was observed with CD8 T cells and NK cells demonstrating longer residency than CD4 conventional T cells and regulatory T cells, which in turn resided in tissues longer than B cells. With few exceptions, however, average residency was at least an order of magnitude shorter than the life-span of the mouse, indicating a more dynamic form of steady-state tissue residency than usually assumed.

Infection with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) triggered MAS via and IFN{gamma}, despite normal viral clearance. Il18tg NK cell transcriptomes showed replicative activity, but few changes in canonical NK function or maturation pathways. LCMV clearance is NK-independent, so we challenged Il18tg mice with mousepox in which NK cells are critical early orchestrators of clearance. Il18tg mice's NK cells failed to activate or expand, but mousepox further activated their CTL and early viral control was normal. Il18tg mice soon developed \"MAS\" including hepatosplenic necrosis, but (contrasting with LCMV) they showed poor virus-specific CTL expansion and viral clearance. Though more normal at rest, Il18bpKO mice's NK cells were similarly inert upon mousepox infection, and the mice succumbed to viremic MAS like Il18tg.

However, its role in other immune cell types has not been fully established. We investigated the function of the one-carbon pathway in CD8+ T cells, which are the primary effectors responsible for the destruction of pancreatic beta cells that causes type 1 diabetes. Enzymes involved in the one-carbon pathway, as well as levels of formate, a critical intermediate, were upregulated during CD8+ T-cell activation. Pharmacological inhibition of MTHFD2, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in one-carbon metabolism, suppressed CD8+ T-cell activation, proliferation, and effector function. Mechanistically, this effect was mediated by reduced signaling through KRAS and the mTORC1 downstream targets HIF1a, S6, and STAT3. As previously shown in CD4+ T cells, formate supplementation reversed the effects of MTHFD2 inhibition on activation, proliferation, and function of CD8+ T cells, and prevented the reduction of the TCF1high CD8+ progenitor cell population, which has been shown to drive anti-beta cell autoimmunity. Formate levels were elevated in the immune cells isolated from pancreatic lymph nodes during the insulitis stage in non-obese diabetic mice.

Associative learning could lead to such specialisation by improving the ability of predators to detect or recognize prey types or optimizing the sensory cues or spatial locations that they attend to. In this study, we assess the ability of Western black widow spiders for associative learning in response to vibrational prey cues. Black widow spiders are sedentary predators that detect, identify, and choose whether to attack preys caught in the web using the frequency and strength of vibrations. We conducted two experiments assessing the ability of individuals to associate specific frequencies or spatial locations on the web to the presence of a prey. We analyzed changes in web structure and attack behavior through learning. We hypothesized that individuals would adjust the structure of their webs and their responsiveness towards these frequencies in response to these associations. Spiders did not adjust the structure of their web nor their response to specific web locations when we applied prey items and vibrations at specific locations on the web. Instead, all spiders increased their responsiveness to vibrations at 250 Hz irrespective of their experimental treatment, but not towards 25Hz cues. Unexpectedly, exposing spiders to prey items associated with a 250Hz increased the effect of trap threads on responsiveness itself. Hence, repeated exposures, even when paired with food on rare occasions can alter foraging behavior in this species. Individuals could adjust their foraging behavior by tending more or less intensely to specific sensory information. This generalist predator could change major components of its foraging behavior through learning, but the effect of learning on behavior appears mediated by web structure. Learning combined with variation in web structure could explain the substantial individual differences in attack behavior we observe in this species.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

The characterization of mechanical properties is needed to unravel complex phenomena like migration, morphogenesis, mechanotransduction, or shape regulation, but accurate data on large numbers of single cells remain scarce and challenging. The capacity to measure forces in populations of cells and to identify subsets within heterogeneous ensembles would enable to reveal and manipulate their intrinsic complexity. Traction Force Microscopy (TFM) is a technology that can quantify the contractile forces exerted by cells via measuring the displacement of fluorescent beads embedded on the surface of a soft substrate with precisely defined mechanical properties. However, conventional numerical approaches for measuring cellular forces using TFM are labor-intensive and often yield significant artifacts, making them ill-suited for high-throughput analysis. In this work, we propose using the Demons algorithm instead, leading to significant improvements in both computational efficiency and accuracy. Based computer simulations, we show that this methodology outperforms conventional approaches in terms of speed, it is less sensitive to the blur induced by out-of-focus images and improves the accuracy of force field reconstructions. Additionally, we conducted experiments using various cell lines and gels of distinct stiffness to demonstrate that the Demons algorithm is capable of real-time and effective at clustering cells according to their mechanotype.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Culture of monocytes, isolated from healthy individuals, and differentiated into polarized M1 macrophages, together with a cytokine mixture (IL-1{beta}, IFN-{gamma}, and TNF-), to mimic the inflammatory cytokine storm, for 24 h markedly increased VDAC1 and Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) release in culture medium. The presence of the cytokine mixture reduced the ATP content, cell viability, and the phagocytic capability of macrophages.

Agr signalling appeared inactive in the kidney; consistent with this, agr mutant abscesses fully developed.

Very little is known about defense systems specialized to counter these phages. Here, we show that AVAST Type V (Avs5) systems, part of the STAND superfamily and spanning three phylogenetic Avs5 clades, confer conserved immunity against jumbo phages. Using localization microscopy and biotin proximity labeling we demonstrate that Avs5 localizes to early infection vesicles, where it senses an essential, early expressed phage protein named JADA Jumbo phage AVAST5 Defense Activator. Recognition of phage infection triggers the Sir2-like effector domain of Avs5 across all three Avs5 clades, resulting in rapid NAD+ hydrolysis, disruption of phage nucleus formation, and arrest of infection. These findings reveal a spatially coordinated bacterial immune strategy that targets an early vulnerability in jumbo phage infection.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

The viral S protein evolved towards highly efficient antibody evasion and replicative capacity in the upper respiratory tract resulting in high transmissibility. At the same time, the mutations acquired in the S protein diminish infection of the lung epithelium and pathogenic potential. The changing entry requirements for Omicron sub-lineages that lead to this shift in tropism remain poorly understood. We resolve the changing replication requirements of SARS-CoV-2 to be related to two distinct pools of ACE2. The first pool relates to ACE2s role in the renin angiotensin system (RAS) and this pool can complex with TMPRSS2 (RAS-ACE2). The second pool relates to ACE2s role as a protein solute carrier chaperone than cannot complex with TMPRSS2 (Chaperone ACE2). Here, we demonstrate that pre-Omicron lineages replicate in a TMPRSS2 dependent manner across both ACE2 pools, whilst Omicron lineages can only spread and replicate using chaperone ACE2. This provides a mechanistic basis for the evolving infectivity requirements of SARS-CoV-2 and furthermore provides approaches to track and monitor ACE2 utilizing coronaviruses.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

While its antiviral function is well established in retroviral systems, its role in SARS-CoV-2 egress remains unclear. Here, we used a virus-like particle (VLP) system composed of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins M, E, and N to investigate the impact of BST-2 on viral particle release. BST-2 significantly inhibited VLP release in HEK293T and Calu-3 lung epithelial cells. Confocal microscopy revealed that BST-2 colocalizes with viral structural proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), the main site of coronavirus assembly. We next evaluated the roles of the SARS-CoV-2 accessory proteins ORF3a and ORF7a in overcoming this restriction. ORF3a localized to endolysosomal compartments and promoted VLP release through a BST-2-independent mechanism, without altering BST-2 expression or localization. In contrast, ORF7a colocalized with both BST-2 and ERGIC markers and restored VLP release by promoting BST-2 degradation. Notably, ORF7a also relieved BST-2-mediated restriction of HIV-1 VLP release, suggesting a conserved antagonistic function. These findings identify BST-2 as an intracellular inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 particle release and establish ORF7a as viral accessory antagonist that neutralizes this host defense.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

These introductions, documented for tens of thousands of taxa, are a departure from the natural constraints of dispersal that have long shaped species distributions. However, current knowledge on their impacts on global biogeography remains poorly understood and fragmented. Here, we review empirical evidence across 15 classical biogeographical rules to assess how non-native species are altering the spatial structure of global biodiversity. Our synthesis reveals that while some patterns, such as species-area relationships, are often reinforced under invasion, others, including the delineation of global biogeographic regions, relationships between island isolation-diversity and between body sizes and latitudinal gradient (i.e., Bergman s rule), already show profound reshaping in contemporary assemblages. Additionally, other patterns (e.g., latitudinal gradient of species diversity; body size and insularity) show context-dependent changes, shaped by factors such as spatial scale, taxonomic group, and introduction history. These transformations are often more pronounced at broad spatial scales and in highly invaded systems such as islands and temperate regions.

Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer an autologous, developmentally flexible alternative, but most differentiation protocols require fluorescence-activated cell sorting, limiting scalability. Here we present a streamlined method that produces highly pure ECs directly from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) without cell sorting. Extending Wnt activation with CHIR99021 to three days maximizes mesoderm induction, and brief Notch blockade with DAPT during specification suppresses smooth-muscle commitment. The result is over 90 % CD31 CD144 ECs that display classic cobblestone morphology, robust DiI-acetylated LDL uptake, and capillary-like sprouting comparable to HUVECs. Bulk RNA barcoding and sequencing segregates the hESC-derived ECs from both HUVECs and undifferentiated hESCs and uncovers an arterial-skewed transcriptome: NOTCH1, DLL4, and CXCR4 are up-regulated, whereas venous markers (EPHB4, NRP2) are reduced. Enrichment of Notch-responsive pathways further supports an arterial-like identity. Although several adult functional genes (e.g., vWF, NOS3) are expressed at lower levels than in HUVECs, the protocol delivers a scalable source of developmentally relevant ECs ideal for vascularizing organoids derived from the same hPSCs and for future applications in drug screening, disease modeling, and cell-based vascular therapies.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

In this report, we introduce BAGEL, a modular, open-source framework for programmable protein engineering, enabling flexible exploration of sequence space through model-agnostic and gradient-free exploration of an energy landscape. BAGEL formalizes protein design as the sampling of an energy function, either to optimize (find a global optimum) or to explore a basin of interest (generate diverse candidates). This energy function is composed of user-defined terms capturing geometric constraints, sequence embedding similarities, or structural confidence metrics. BAGEL also natively supports multi-state optimization and advanced Monte Carlo techniques, providing researchers with a flexible alternative to fixed-backbone and inverse-folding paradigms common in current design workflows. Moreover, the package seamlessly integrates a wide range of publicly available deep learning protein models, allowing users to rapidly take full advantage of any future improvements in model accuracy and speed. We illustrate the versatility of BAGEL on four archetypal applications: designing de novo peptide binders, targeting intrinsically disordered epitopes, selectively binding to species-specific variants, and generating enzyme variants with conserved catalytic sites. By offering a modular, easy-to-use platform to define custom protein design objectives and optimization strategies, BAGEL aims to speed up the design of new proteins. Our goal with its release is to democratize protein design, abstracting the process as much as possible from technical implementation details and thereby making it more accessible to the broader scientific community, unlocking untapped potential for innovation in biotechnology and therapeutics.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

In AFM, the tip shape and dimensions determine the contact geometry between the tip and the sample and the length scales at which the mechanical properties are probed. Given the complex multiscale structure of spheroids, the choice of tip geometry and size would allow, in principle, to dissect the mechanical response of the overall system into the contributions of the constituents, from the single cell level to the cellular aggregate. In this work, we studied the mechanical properties of spheroids derived from four cell lines (A549, NHLF, HT-29, CCD-18Co). Our studies revealed that using different contact geometries in the fitting procedure results in significantly different Young's modulus values, highlighting the multiscale response of these complex cellular systems and the importance of a precise experiment design and choice of the AFM probe for the nano-mechanical measurements.

Here, we demonstrate that niclosamide exhibits a dose-dependent biphasic effect, promoting uncoupling at low concentration while acting as a mitochondrial inhibitor at high concentration, which could restrict its therapeutic window and limit efficacy. To overcome this challenge, we aimed to develop next-generation mitochondrial uncouplers (MUs) by synthesizing and evaluating novel Niclosamide derivatives with enhanced therapeutic potential. Through structural modifications, we optimized uncoupling activity while reducing inhibitory toxicity, thereby expanding the pharmacological window.

Unlike many existing approaches, it does not require specialized equipment, chemical reagents, or expensive software. In this context, clusters of pixels represent biological structures such as tissues or entire organisms, with their activity reflecting dynamic changes during the recording. The application can distinguish active pixels from inactive ones within selected regions of interest (ROIs) and measure their intensity over a pre-set time. It offers two distinct analyses: Graphical Analysis (GA), and Pixel Activity Analysis (PAA), both customizable to accommodate various experiments. GA generates a graphical illustration of pixel activity (in selected ROIs) over time together with numerical data from the measurement. PAA produces PNG images highlighting the active regions (clusters of pixels) in the video. Initially designed to analyze muscle contractions in tick tissues, TickMotion is useful for applications extending to any movement analysis.

F.", "abstract": "Amphibious animals, such as frogs and toads, are found at the intersection of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They often serve as keystone and sentinel species, essential in nutrient cycling and food webs. In recent decades, amphibians have experienced drastic population declines due to habitat loss, climate change, and disease. These declines have prompted investments in ex situ conservation and captive breeding programs, which aim to reduce extinction risk by creating assurance colonies and reintroducing individuals once threats are mitigated. A critical component of these programs is proper husbandry, ensuring the health and longevity of captive populations and their ability to reproduce offspring that can be reintroduced into the wild. The artificial environment in captivity can profoundly impact animal behavior and health, particularly concerning diet and nutrition. Diet not only provides nutrients and energy but also shapes the host's gut microbial community, which in turn impacts digestive health. Complex microbial communities, collectively known as the microbiome, are characterized by the high biodiversity of prokaryotes, microscopic fungi, and viruses. The diet-associated microbiome is increasingly studied for its role in captive animal health and behavior, although research has focused more on bacteria than fungal communities, or the \"mycobiome\". Here, we investigated the core mycobiome using metabarcoding of fungal communities in fifteen Anaxyrus fowleri (Fowler's Toad) specimens, documenting shifts as toads transition from wild to captive settings. We identified a core set of fungal taxa and observed distinct changes in non-core fungi associated with dietary differences.

Although TDP-43 is expressed in every cell type, its function and subcellular localization are particularly important for neuronal homeostasis. However, it is unknown if TDP-43 has a role during herpesvirus infection. Herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), a ubiquitous neurotropic pathogen, is considered a contributing factor to neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we tested the requirement for TDP-43 during HSV-1 infection in neuronal and non-neuronal cells. HSV-1 infection of epithelial cells and primary fibroblasts did not change overall TDP-43 abundance, nor did TDP-43 depletion detectably alter HSV-1 replication in a multicycle growth experiment. By contrast, when TDP-43 was depleted in neuronally derived, matured HD10.6 cells, HSV-1 infectious virus production was significantly reduced in both single- and multicycle growth experiments. Notably, TDP-43 depletion restricts viral lytic gene expression at the immediate-early phase. Through nanopore direct RNA-sequencing we uncovered enhanced intron retention in two essential viral genes upon TDP-43 depletion.

We investigated how alcohol-associated gut microbiota (AGMs) modulate liver kinome signalling to drive inflammation and fibrosis in ALD. Method: Liver kinome and metaproteome changes were studied in rats (n=6/group) colonized with stool of severe alcohol-related hepatitis (SAH) patients (SAH to healthy-rats) or healthy human donors (HD to ALD-rats). AGM-associated liver kinome changes were cross-correlated with bacterial genera. A bacterial protein; Streptococcal collagen-like protein 1 (Scl1) was identified with affinity for TGFBR1. This was validated by molecular docking and immunoprecipitation-LCMS assay. Expression of Streptococcus pneumonia and pyogenes was done in stool of SAH patients (n=10). Also, Scl1 was quantified in patient stool (n=24) and liver tissue (n=19) samples. Validation was performed by assessing Scl1 level in plasma and Streptococcus level in stool samples before and after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in SAH patients. Results: Stool metaproteomics showed significant increase in 10 bacterial genera (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and Clostridium) in SAH to Healthy-rats, mirroring changes seen in ALD-rats (FC>1.5, p<0.05). Clusters of Orthologous Groups analysis indicated increased post-translational modifications (PTMs) and decreased lipid metabolism in ALD-rats and SAH to Healthy-rats. Liver kinome profiling showed 85 upregulated kinases in SAH to Healthy-rats, with 34 overlapping with ALD-rats, associated with inflammation (Mapk14, Map3k10 and others), fibrosis (Tgfbr1, Igf1r, and others), lipid metabolism (Cdk14, Cdk18) and regeneration (Met, Bmpr1a and others). FMT from healthy human-donors to ALD-rats reversed the expression of Streptococcus (10-fold), Staphylococcus (3-fold), and Clostridium (5-fold), along with 18 kinases associated with inflammation (Btk, Camk4, Nuak1) and fibrosis (Tgfbr1, Col4a1, Fgfr2 and others). Strong association (r2>0.9, p<0.05) was seen between Streptococcus abundance and fibrosis and inflammation-related kinases. Level of Scl1 was significantly high in SAH and ALD-rat stool samples (FC>2, p<0.05). It showed strong affinity for TGFBR1, as validated by molecular docking (>86%confidence) and immunoprecipitation assays (>100FC,p<0.05), indicating it as a potential ligand for TGFBR1. Concordantly, expression of Scl1 was highest amongst all the known ligands for TGFBR1 (p<0.05) suggesting Scl1 is a major contributor for TGFBR1 activation and its downstream signalling in these patients. Following fecal microbiota transplantation, expression of Scl1 in plasma and Streptococcus levels in stool were significantly reduced by 2.1-folds and 1.9 folds respectively in SAH patients. Further, Scl1 levels SAH plasma is capable of predicting poor therapeutic response and 30-day mortality with high accuracy (AUC=0.92, cutoff >70 normalized abundance). Conclusion: Alcohol induced gut dysbiosis alters the liver kinome, promoting inflammation, fibrosis, and lipid dysregulation. Streptococcal Scl1 is identified as a bacterial protein mimicking human collagen and capable of activating fibrotic signalling pathway through TGFBR1in liver and is capable of predicting poor response in SAH.

Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are associated with worsened lung function, poor outcomes, and increased hospital visits. We sought to improve understanding of the effects of respiratory viral infections and host immune response on the resident bacterial community of the airways, using cystic fibrosis as a model. We performed an observational longitudinal study of 38 adults with CF and collected sinus and sputum samples at 6-month intervals from 2017 - 2021. We performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the airway microbiota, real-time RT-PCR for viral infection detection, and cytokine quantification. We observed viral positivity rates of 19% and 14% in sinus and sputum samples, respectively. Human rhinovirus was the most frequently observed viral pathogen in both sinus and sputum samples. We measured a significant perturbance of the bacterial community during viral infection that did not return to baseline following resolution of the viral infection. This perturbation was driven by a significant increase in Pseudomonas relative abundance during viral infection. Furthermore, we found significant associations with increased Pseudomonas relative abundance for several pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-2, IL-8, and interferon (IFN)-{lambda}1. These findings indicate an important role for respiratory viral infections and the host immune response in the development and maintenance of chronic Pseudomonas infections in the context of CF airway disease and broadly expand our understanding of viral-bacterial coinfection of the airways.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Background: The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) urge the development of novel drugs and efficient therapeutic programs. A recent study aiming to uncover differential beta-lactam susceptibility phenotypes in clinical strains of Mtb found that the M237V substitution in cwlM (Rv3915) was associated with increased susceptibility to amoxicillin. Considering that Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm) is a widely used surrogate model for Mtb, we constructed a cwlM knockdown mutant in Msm using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to elucidate the role of CwlM in beta-lactam susceptibility and intracellular survival. Results: Quantitative RT-PCR assays confirmed the successful repression of cwlM, while the phenotyping assays confirmed the essentiality of CwlM-related processes for mycobacterial viability. Collectively, the antibiotic susceptibility assays suggested that CwlMSMEG may promote beta-lactam resistance, particularly to meropenem and cefotaxime. Moreover, CwlMSMEG was found to support M. smegmatis intracellular survival within THP-1-derived macrophages. To address conflicting reports regarding its predicted peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolase activity, we purified recombinant CwlMTB. The Micrococcus luteus-derived PG-based zymogram indicated that CwlMTB lacks PG-hydrolytic activity, suggesting it might act as a regulator of PG biosynthesis instead. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that CwlM contributes to beta-lactam resistance and intracellular survival, regardless of lacking detectable PG-hydrolytic activity. Overall, CwlM was found to be essential and highly vulnerable, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target that warrants further investigation.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

In this study, we conducted a multi-dimensional analysis of gut microbiota composition and functional pathways in rats, spanning the continuum from health, through the T2D pathological state, to post-intervention recovery phases. During the T2D stage, both gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles exhibited distinct characteristics compared to those of healthy age-matched older rats. Notably, {beta}-T3 and MET interventions not only facilitated the recovery of gut microbial diversity and metabolite levels in T2D mice but also promoted the proliferation of specific dominant species, each intervention favoring distinct taxa. In this context, B. acidifaciens emerged as a dominant bacterial species in T2D, exerting regulatory effects on glycometabolism through BA and amino acid metabolic pathways.

C.", "abstract": "The Mre11 nuclease, part of the conserved MRX complex involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), is also essential to initiate meiotic recombination in budding yeast by promoting Spo11-induced DSBs. Recruitment of Mre11 to meiotic DSB sites depends on Rec114-Mei4 and Mer2 (RMM) that organize the meiotic DSB machinery by a mechanism involving biomolecular condensation. Here, we explored the role of Mre11 during meiosis and its relationship to RMM condensation. We show that both Mre11 and MRX complexes form DNA-dependent, hexanediol sensitive condensates in vitro. In vivo, Mre11 assembles into DNA damage-dependent foci in vegetative cells and DSB-independent foci in meiotic cells. In vitro condensates and in vivo foci both depend on the C-terminal intrinsically-disordered region (IDR) of Mre11. Importantly, while the Mre11 IDR is dispensable for vegetative DNA repair it is essential during meiosis. The C-terminus of Mre11 forms a short alpha-helix that binds a conserved region of Mer2, and mutating residues within this interface reduces Mre11 foci and DSB formation. Finally, we identified a SUMO-interacting motif within the Mre11 IDR that enhances recruitment of Mre11 during meiosis and facilitates DSB formation. This work identifies multiple mechanisms that collaborate to recruit Mre11 during meiosis to initiate recombination.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

While RNA can form different conformations in solution, the extent to which it folds into structure ensembles and how the different conformations regulate gene expression still needs to be fully understood. We coupled the SHAPE compound NAI-N3 with direct RNA sequencing to identify structure modifications along a single RNA molecule (sm-PORE-cupine). Using a combination of base mapping and direct signal alignment, we boosted the percentage of mappable RNA molecules from direct RNA sequencing. Using Bernoulli Mixture Model (BMM) clustering, we show that we can separate RNA structure ensembles from ligand-bound and unbound riboswitches accurately, identify isoform-specific structure ensembles along the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and determine RNA structure ensembles in the transcriptome of a eukaryote, C. albicans, at yeast (30C) and hyphae (37C) states. We observed that RNAs are more structurally homogenous at 37C compared to 30C, are more variable in vivo than in vitro, and show higher homogeneity in 3UTRs than in the coding region. We also identified structure ensembles that are associated with changes in translation efficiency and decay in C. albicans at 30C and 37C and validated translational changes using reporter assays. Our work shows that single-molecule RNA structure probing using direct RNA sequencing can be applied to diverse transcriptomes to study the complexity and function of RNA structures.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

As an extensively characterized epi-transcriptomic mark found in virtually all eukaryotes, m6A in mRNA is deposited by METTL3-METTL14 complex. As a transcription-associated epigenetic mark abundantly present in many unicellular eukaryotes, 6mA is coordinately maintained by two AMT1 complexes, distinguished by their mutually exclusive subunits, AMT6 and AMT7. These are all members of MT-A70 family methyltransferases (MTases). Despite their functional importance, no structure for holo-complexes with cognate DNA/RNA substrate has been resolved. Here, we employ AlphaFold3 (AF3) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for structural modeling of Tetrahymena AMT1 complexes, with emphasis on ternary holo-complexes with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) substrate and cofactor. Key structural features observed in these models are validated by mutagenesis and various other biophysical and biochemical approaches. Our analysis reveals the structural basis for DNA substrate recognition, base flipping, and catalysis in the prototypical eukaryotic DNA 6mA-MTase. It also allows us to delineate the reaction pathway for processive DNA methylation involving translocation of the closed form AMT1 complex along dsDNA. As the active site is highly conserved across MT-A70 family of eukaryotic 6mA/m6A-MTases, the structural insight will facilitate rational design of small molecule inhibitors, especially for METTL3-METTL14, a promising target in cancer therapeutics.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

This causes extensive translational reprogramming and alters mRNA processing and export. Here, we reveal that another major consequence of cytoplasmic RNase L activity is the repression of nascent RNA synthesis in the nucleus. This is not associated with altered nuclear RNA stability but instead results from a global loss of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) occupancy across the genome. Prominent among the transcriptionally downregulated loci are immune-related genes, supporting a role for RNase L in tempering innate immune and inflammatory responses. These transcriptional changes are associated with reduced levels and altered localization of a portion of serine 5-phosphorylated Pol II into nuclear speckles. Crosstalk between RNA decay and transcription thereby contributes to the large-scale modulation of gene expression in RNase L-activated cells.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Such damage-induced cellular plasticity restores homeostasis and prevents pathology, yet its underlying molecular basis remains largely unexplored. Here, we reported damage-induced cellular plasticity of secretory enteroendocrine cells (EEs) in the adult Drosophila midgut. We found that ionizing radiation enhanced EE plasticity such that it promoted EEs to dedifferentiate into ISCs and subsequently re-differentiate towards ECs. We identified that radiation induced the production of a stress-inducible transcription factor Xrp1 in EE lineages, and its upregulation was necessary for EE plasticity. Single-cell RNA sequencing of guts with EE-specific Xrp1 overexpression revealed ectopic expression of progenitor-specific genes in EEs, which was necessary for Xrp1 to drive EE plasticity. Our work provides a mechanistic framework for understanding cellular plasticity and suggests its potential role in damage-induced responses.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

To understand the structure and function relationships of different SARS-CoV-2 variants that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic, we performed high-throughput structure probing and modelling of the genomic structures of the wildtype (WT), Alpha, Beta, Delta and Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2. We observed that genomes of SARS-CoV-2 variants are generally structurally conserved, and that single-nucleotide variations and interactions with RNA binding proteins can impact RNA structures across the viruses. Importantly, using proximity ligation sequencing, we identified many conserved ultra-long-range RNA-RNA interactions, including one that spans more than 17 kb in both the WT virus and the Omicron variant. We showed that mutations that disrupt this 17 kb long-range interaction reduce viral fitness at later stages of its infection cycle, while compensatory mutations partially restore virus fitness. Additionally, we showed that this ultra-long-range RNA-RNA interaction structure binds directly to ADAR1 to alter the RNA editing levels on the viral genome.

However, the lack of experimentally validated gold standards presents a significant obstacle in evaluating the accuracy and biological relevance of inferred networks. This study delivers a comprehensive comparative assessment of six widely used microbial network inference algorithms--gCoda, OIPCQ, S-E(glasso), S-E(mb), SPRING, and SparCC--using four diverse real-world microbiome datasets alongside multiple types of generated data, including synthetic, noisy, and bootstrap-derived datasets. Our evaluation framework extends beyond conventional synthetic benchmarking by emphasizing reproducibility-focused assessments grounded in biologically realistic perturbations. We show that bootstrap resampling and low-level noisy datasets (<=10% perturbation) effectively preserve key statistical properties of real microbiome data, such as diversity indices, abundance distributions, and sparsity patterns. Conversely, synthetic datasets generated via the widely used SPIEC-EASI method exhibit substantial divergence from real data across these metrics. We find that while SparCC demonstrates superior robustness across varying data conditions, other methods tend to produce inflated performance metrics when evaluated on unrealistic synthetic networks. Notably, several algorithms fail to distinguish between structured and random networks, highlighting issues of structural insensitivity and the limitations of overreliance on synthetic benchmarks. To address these challenges, we propose a reproducibility-centered benchmarking framework that prioritizes real-data-derived perturbations and mandates rigorous statistical validation of synthetic datasets before their use.

However, as pathway complexity increases, so does the size of both the combinatorial design space and the DNA constructs required, rendering unbiased screens intractable. To address this, we developed Shotgun Genetic Engineering (SGE), a scalable approach that exploits the ease of delivering many barcoded small constructs - rather than a single large one - into mammalian cells. This allows each cell to serve as an independent experiment, carrying a unique synthetic metabolic pathway that explores combinations of gene content, stoichiometry, and organellar localization. Functional pathways are identified by sequencing barcodes from cells exhibiting the desired phenotype. Using SGE, we screened millions of pathway combinations to engineer essential amino acid biosynthesis in two mammalian cell lines (CHO and Jurkat), achieving near-wild-type growth in valine-free medium and, for the first time, enabling isoleucine prototrophy in CHO cells. Successful solutions favored mitochondrial localization and required integration of 23-52 kb of synthetic DNA - lengths that are impractical to screen by conventional methods. The resulting datasets are compatible with machine learning frameworks, positioning SGE as a powerful platform for decoding and engineering complex biosynthetic traits in mammalian systems.", "date": "2025-07-08", "journal": ""}

Sampling times are often used for calibration since some organisms accumulate enough mutations over the course of their sampling period. This practice ties two key concepts: measurably evolving populations and the phylodynamic threshold. Current dogma suggests that populations meeting these criteria are suitable for molecular clock calibration via sampling times. However, the definitions and implications of these concepts remain unclear. Using Hepatitis B virus-like simulations and analyses of empirical data, this study shows that determining whether a population is measurably evolving or has reached the phylodynamic threshold does not only depend on the data, but also on model assumptions and sampling strategies. In Bayesian applications, a lack of temporal signal due to a narrow sampling window results in a prior that is overly informative relative to the data, such that a prior that is potentially misleading typically requires a wider sampling window than one that is reasonable. In our analyses we demonstrate that assessing prior sensitivity is more important than the outcome of tests of temporal signal.
