While human studies have largely focused on discrete or pulsed stimuli with staggered onsets, many natural tactile signals are continuous and rhythmically patterned. Here, we investigate whether phase differences between simultaneously presented,continuous amplitude-modulated vibrations can induce the perception of motion across fingertips. Participants reliably perceived motion direction at modulation frequencies up to 1Hz, with discrimination performance systematically dependent on the phase lag between vibrations. Critically, trial-level confidence reports revealed lowest certainty for anti-phase (180{degrees}) conditions, consistent with stimulus ambiguity as predicted by my mathematical framework. I propose two candidate computational mechanisms for tactile motion processing. The first is a conventional cross-correlation computation over the envelopes; The second is a probabilistic model based on the uncertain detection of temporal reference points (e.g., envelope peaks) within threshold-defined windows. This model, despite having only a single parameter (uncertainty width determined by an amplitude discrimination threshold), accounts for both the non-linear shape and asymmetries of observed psychometric functions. These results demonstrate that the human tactile system can extract directional information from distributed phase-coded signals in the absence of spatial displacement, revealing a motion perception mechanism that parallels arthropod systems but potentially arises from distinct perceptual constraints.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

However, the extent to which acute stress affects the cognitive mechanisms underlying target enhancement and distractor suppression when selecting emotionally neutral stimuli remains unclear. MethodsWe explored this issue using the Maastricht Acute Stress Test (MAST)a visual search task, and event-related potential recordings. Eighty healthy adults participanted in the experiment, which required them to search for a specific target while ignoring a color singleton distractor. Results: The MAST successfully induced a stress response in the stress group, as indicated by the higher levels of salivary cortisol, state anxiety, negative emotion, as well as lower levels of positive emotion. Importantly, the stress group showed a significantly smaller N2pc in the lateral target with middle distractor displays than the control group. However, no significant differences in PD were observed in the middle target with lateral distractor displays. ConclusionsThese results suggest that acute stress impairs target enhancement rather than distractor suppression during the selection of attention. This impairment may be due to impaired prefrontal cortex function under acute stress. The present research provides new insight into how acute stress affects attention selection.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Using CRISPR-induced breaks, high-resolution imaging, and transcriptional inhibition, we show that RNAPII activity drives the formation of nucleolar repair caps. Mechanistically, CtIP promotes RNAPII recruitment and H3K36 trimethylation at rDNA lesions, facilitating HR. Disruption of this RNAPII/CtIP/H3K36me3 axis impairs cap formation and repair, leading to persistent damage. RNAPII inhibition exacerbates genome instability and synergizes with rDNA breaks to induce cancer cell death, without acutely impairing ribosome function.

Affected patients present from an early onset with a motor-greater-than-sensory polyneuropathy that is currently incurable. NMAN is a global cause of inherited peripheral neuropathy with higher prevalence in Europe and Asia. Nearly 30 distinct NMAN-associated variants have been reported to date, mostly in sporadic patients and small families. There is limited functional characterization of most of them, resulting in limited knowledge on their pathogenic mode of action and hindering the development of therapeutical strategies. Methods: We systematically (re-)evaluated the pathogenicity of all reported HINT1 variants associated with NMAN using several in silico pathogenicity predictors used in the standard of care genetic testing. Fifteen missense and one truncating variants were further mapped onto the HINT1 crystal structure and grouped according to their spatial distribution. We combined several structural modeling tools to assess the impact of the variants on protein stability in both monomeric and dimeric forms. These variants underwent further functional validation by immunoblotting in both HeLa HINT1 knockout cell lines and in a S. cerevisiae strain deficient for the HINT1 orthologue. Finally, we tested the in vivo functionality of each variant by its ability to rescue yeast growth under stress conditions. Results: Our combinatorial approach allowed the systematic characterization and (re-)evaluation of all known HINT1 variants associated with NMAN, enabling improved pathogenicity classification. Additionally, this standardized functional assessment allowed their categorization into four structure-based groups: 1) truncating variants; 2) variants of the catalytic pocket; 3) variants at the dimer interface; 4) variants in the distal b-hairpin and nearby loop. Functional tests in yeast and mammalian disease models demonstrated their detrimental- yet differential -effect on HINT1 function, enabling structure-function correlations. Conclusions: Our standardized experimental pipeline allows for the characterization of newly discovered HINT1 variants in the context of NMAN, facilitating their pathogenicity interpretation. This work highlights the value of combining structural and functional approaches to understand better the underlying disease mechanisms.

M.", "abstract": "To counteract host antiviral responses, influenza A virus triggers a global reduction of cellular gene expression, a process termed \"host shutoff.\" A key effector of influenza A virus host shutoff is the viral endoribonuclease PA-X, which degrades host mRNAs. While many of the molecular determinants of PA-X activity remain unknown, a previous study found that N-terminal acetylation of PA-X is required for its host shutoff activity. However, it remains unclear how this co-translational modification promotes PA-X activity. Here, we report that PA-X N-terminal acetylation has two functions that can be separated based on whether acetylation occurs on the first amino acid, the initiator methionine, or the second amino acid following initiator methionine excision. Modification at either site is sufficient to ensure PA-X localization to the nucleus. However, modification of the second amino acid is not sufficient for host shutoff activity of ectopically expressed PA-X, which specifically requires N-terminal acetylation of the initiator methionine. Interestingly, during infection N-terminal acetylation of PA-X at any position results in host shutoff activity, suggesting that additional factors during infection can augment the host shutoff activity of PA-X. Our studies thus uncover a multifaceted role for PA-X N-terminal acetylation in regulation of this important immunomodulatory factor.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Vancomycin is the first-line antibiotic to treat methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections.

Rapid assessment of their resistance levels and underlying molecular profiles is crucial for preventing their spread and counteracting resistance; however, the broad resistance spectrum and the diversity of genetic changes have impeded this practice. Here, we demonstrate that the vancomycin resistance levels of various MRSA strains can be determined using dimension-reduced Raman spectra obtained from single cells. The transcriptome profiles of the different strains can also be predicted from their dimensionally reduced Raman spectra by simple linear regression. This Raman-transcriptome correspondence allows us to map the transcriptome components onto dimension-reduced Raman space and characterize groups of genes associated with different phenotypes. Furthermore, single-cell Raman spectra predicted a cell strain with greater phenotypic heterogeneity, which was confirmed by single-cell growth analysis.

At higher signal-to-noise ratios, however, nonlinear response components become relevant. Theoretical results for leaky integrate-and-fire neurons in the weakly nonlinear regime suggest strong responses at the sum of two input frequencies if these frequencies or their sum match the neuron's baseline firing rate. We here analyze nonlinear responses in two types of primary electroreceptor afferents, the P-units of the active and the ampullary cells of the passive electrosensory system of the wave-type electric fish Apteronotus leptorhynchus. In our combined experimental and modeling approach we identify these predicted nonlinear responses in low-noise P-units and, much stronger, in ampullary cells.

Characterized by the presence of glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) primarily composed of fibrillar alpha-synuclein (aSyn), formation of MSA neuropathology presents similarities to prion propagation. While previous investigations have scrutinized fibrils extracted from MSA brains, their possible protein-only replication was questioned and their capacity to induce GCIs in animal models was not explored. Conversely, the synthetic fibril strain 1B assembled from recombinant human aSyn self-replicates autonomously in vitro and induces GCIs in mice, suggesting relevance to MSA. Here we report the high-resolution structural analysis of 1B fibrils as well as of the fibrils extracted from 1B-injected diseased mice presenting GCIs (1BP). We demonstrate in vivo that conformational templating drives the replication of a fibril strain, leading in this case to MSA inclusion pathology. In addition to the similarity of 1B and 1BP, both structures mimic the fold adopted by aSyn in one of the protofilaments of the fibrils extracted from MSA patients. Finally, reinjection of diluted crude mouse brain homogenates containing 1BP into the brain of new mice reproduces the experimental MSA neuropathology seen with the parent synthetic seed 1B. Our findings thus identify 1B as a synthetic pathogen capable of self-replication in vivo.

D.; Sibille, E.", "abstract": "Background: Dysregulated Tau phosphorylation (p-Tau) is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD), resulting in neurofibrillary tangle accumulation, neuronal atrophy and cognitive impairment. Impaired somatostatin (SST) expression and reduced SST-expressing GABAergic neurons significantly contributes to AD-related pathophysiology and correlates with cognitive impairment. SST+ interneurons inhibit the dendrites of excitatory neurons in cortical layers and hippocampus, primarily through 5-GABA-A receptors, regulating cognitive function. Leveraging a newly developed small molecule that targets the 5-GABA-A receptors via positive allosteric modulation (5-PAM), we assessed its effects on p-Tau-related neuronal morphology, cognitive deficits and protein expression. Methods: In the PS19 transgenic mouse model, we administered the 5-PAM, GL-II-73, either acutely or chronically at 3 and 6 months, corresponding to early and advanced stage of p-Tau accumulation. Golgi staining analyzed dendritic morphology and spine density in mice chronically exposed to 5-PAM. Western blotting was used to quantify p-tau and Tau expression. Spatial working memory was assessed using the Y-maze. Results: Chronic treatment at 3 and 6 months mitigated p-Tau-induced loss of spine density and reduced dendritic length. 5-PAM treatment did not affect p-tau levels. 5-PAM effectively reversed spatial working memory deficits induced by p-tau accumulation both acutely and chronically. Conclusions: 5-GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulation displayed neurotrophic (spine and dendritic pathology) and procognitive (working memory) effects in the PS19 model, independently of p-Tau burden.

H.; Fonti, P.; Hellmann, E.; Rademacher, T. T.; Richardson, A. D.; Thomas, P. R.", "abstract": "Current global models of vegetation dynamics are largely carbon (C) source-driven, with behaviour primarily determined by the environmental responses of photosynthesis. However, real plants operate as integrated wholes, with feedbacks between sources, such as photosynthesis, and sinks, such as growth, resulting in homeostatic concentrations of metabolites such as sugars. A parsimonious approach to implementing this homeostatic coupling of C sources and sinks in a tree growth model is presented, and its implications for the responses of net photosynthesis and growth to environmental factors and tree size assessed. Hill functions describe inhibition of C sources (net photosynthesis) and activation of sinks (structural growth) as sucrose concentration increases. The model is parameterised for a typical tree growing at a site in the Amazonian rainforest and its qualitative behaviour is found to be consistent with observations. A key outcome is that sinks and sources strongly regulate each other. Hence environmental factors that affect potential net photosynthesis, such as atmospheric CO2, have greatly reduced effects on growth when homeostatic feedbacks from sucrose concentrations are considered. For example, compared with a C-source-only-driven approach (as in most current global models), the response of tree biomass for a tree currently 300 yr old, to increasing atmospheric CO2 projected to the end of this century under a high scenario, is reduced by ca.77%, from +122% to +29%, with net photosynthesis and growth rate responses reduced by a similar amount. Furthermore, in this coupled approach, any direct controls on growth (either environmental or through phenological controls on xylogensis) will influence source activity through the sucrose feedback. For example, a reduction in potential growth through temperature constraints on cell-wall construction increases sucrose concentrations, resulting in a compensating reduction in net photosynthesis. While net photosynthesis controls growth, growth controls net photosynthesis. In addition, we find a strong effect of changing tree allometry on C source-sink relations as the tree grows. Larger trees are less source-limited due to a higher ratio of sapwood area (and hence potential C assimilation rate) to potential growth rate, consistent with the observed decline in growth response to atmospheric CO2 as trees age. We suggest that the implications of including C source-sink coupling in models of vegetation dynamics, such as dynamic global vegetation models, are likely to be profound.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

The ultimate goal of this process is to produce neural dynamics that enable the rich repertoire of behaviors we perform with our limbs. What begins as a series of \"babbles\" coalesces into skilled motor output as the brain rapidly learns to control the body. However, the nature of the teaching signal underlying this normative learning process remains elusive. Here, we test two well-established and biologically plausible theories-supervised learning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL)-that could explain how neural circuits develop the capacity for skilled movements. We trained recurrent neural networks to control a biomechanical model of a primate arm using either SL or RL and compared the resulting neural dynamics to populations of neurons recorded from the motor cortex of monkeys performing the same movements. Intriguingly, only RL-trained networks produced neural activity that matched their biological counterparts in terms of both the geometry and dynamics of population activity. We show that the similarity between RL-trained networks and biological brains depends critically on matching biomechanical properties of the limb. We then demonstrated that monkeys and RL-trained networks, but not SL-trained networks, show a strikingly similar capacity for robust short-term behavioral adaptation to a movement perturbation, indicating a fundamental and general commonality in the neural control policy.

Crystal structure analysis of GpeC rationalizes leader-independent property and reveals adaptive recognition that enables access to diverse biaryl-linked macrocycles. GpeC exhibits exceptional substrate promiscuity, accommodating 19 of 20 canonical amino acids and diverse noncanonical analogs within a minimal tetrapeptide scaffold. The efficient semi-synthesis of the natural product Rubrin further demonstrated the versatility of GpeC.

Current protein deep learning models are predominantly trained on sequence and/or static structure data, which often fail to capture the dynamic nature of proteins. To address this, we introduce SeqDance and ESMDance, two protein language models trained on dynamic biophysical properties derived from molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analyses of over 64,000 proteins. SeqDance, trained from scratch, learns both local dynamic interactions and global conformational properties for ordered and disordered proteins. SeqDance predicted dynamic property changes reflect mutation effect on protein folding stability. ESMDance, built upon ESM2 outputs, substantially outperforms ESM2 in zero-shot prediction of mutation effects for designed and viral proteins which lack evolutionary information.

Using the Hemibrain connectome, we identified the Oviposition Inhibitory Neuron (oviIN) as a key hub in the oviposition circuit and analyzed its inputs to uncover potential parallel pathways that may be responsible for computations related to sensory integration and decision-making. We applied a network analysis to the subconnectome of inputs to the oviIN to identify clusters of interconnected neurons -- many of which are uncharacterized cell types.

In analogy with disordered systems in statistical physics, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven energy landscape, used as a proxy for protein fitness. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions developed in the context of disordered physical systems, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the initial condition, i.e. the ancestral sequence from which the evolutionary process originated, from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

In macroevolution, mutations generally accumulate continuously over evolutionary timescales comprising many generations. Under cellular reproduction, like somatic evolution within a tumor or evolution within a bacterial population, mutations can occur in discrete steps at individual reproductive events. In this paper, we address the problem of phylodynamic inference in the context of cellular reproduction. We find that mutations occurring at individual cell divisions generate a compound Poisson statistics for the number of mutations along a phylogenetic branch, and this affects the inference from phylogenetic data. These statistics differ from those of molecular clock models even when only a small fraction of the population is sampled. We set up an inference scheme based on the likelihood of a birth-death model to infer the relative death-to-birth rate and the number of mutations per generation. We apply this method to single-cell data from haematopoietic stem cells.

To identify regulatory motifs and their regulatory syntax, deep learning based sequence-to-activity (S2A) models learn transcription factor binding motifs and their combinations from DNA sequence by modeling measured chromatin accessibility. Previously, we developed AI-TAC, a S2A model that predicts chromatin accessibilityacross various immune cell types in multi-task fashion, effectively decoding the regulatory syntax underlying immune cell differentiation. While ATAC-seq is commonly used to measure regional accessibility, it also provides high-resolution profiles, the distribution of Tn5 insertion sites, that offer additional insights into the precise location and strength of TF binding sites. Here we demonstrate that modeling ATAC-seq profiles alongside accessibility consistently improves predictions of differential chromatin accessibility across cell types. Moreover, we also find that multi-task learning across related immune cell types consistently outperforms single-task models. To understand what additional information bpAI-TAC learns from ATAC-seq profiles, we systematically compare sequence attributions from models trained with and without ATAC-seq profiles. We identify novel motifs with strong effect sizes that emerge only when profile data is included.

Previous research has shown that these symptoms are linked to idiosyncratic behavioral and brain activity patterns while viewing natural social events in movies. This study aimed to investigate the replicability of brain activity idiosyncrasy in autistic individuals by comparing their inter-subject functional connectivity (ISFC) with that of neurotypical individuals. Methods: We tested for ISFC differences between autism and neurotypical groups using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from two independent datasets from Germany (Nneurotypical = 25, 7 Males, 18 Females; Nautism = 22, 12 Males, 10 Females) and Finland (Nneurotypical = 19, Nautism = 18; All males). Participants watched short movie stimuli, and pairwise ISFCs were computed across 273 brain regions. Group differences were evaluated using subject-wise permutation tests for each dataset. Results: In both datasets, the autism group showed lower ISFCs compared to the neurotypical group, specifically between visual regions (e.g., occipital gyrus, cuneus) and parietal regions (e.g.,superior and inferior parietal lobules), as well as between visual regions and frontal regions (e.g.,inferior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus). ISFC was higher in the Finnish autism group in temporal regions associated with sound and speech processing. Conclusions: The study confirmed the replicability of reduced ISFCs in autistic individuals during naturalistic movie-watching, especially between visual and parietal/frontal brain regions. These findings reinforce the utility of ISFC and naturalistic movie-watching paradigm in studying neural connectivity alterations in autism.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

They form a separate branch on the phylogenetic tree and contain residue motifs characteristic of anion ChRs (ACRs). However, only two conduct chloride, whereas the closely related Nutomonas longa homolog generates inward cation currents in mammalian cells under physiological conditions, significantly exceeding those by previously known tools with similar spectral maxima (peak absorption at ~440 nm). Measurements of transient absorption changes and pH titration of purified proteins combined with mutant analysis revealed the roles of the residues in the photoactive site.

Younger and older adults (both sexes) listened to the excerpts of naturalistic music with different tempi (1-4 Hz) while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. The results show an age-related enhancement of neural responses to sound onsets, suggesting a loss of inhibition in the aged auditory cortex. Neural tracking of different musical features, including the amplitude envelope, amplitude onset, and spectral flux, were also enhanced in older adults, indicating that the hyperresponsiveness generalizes to features of naturalistic music. However, our results show that, despite enhanced neural responses, older adults exhibit reduced neural sensitivity of early sensory responses to music pieces with different tempi. Moreover, spectral flux mostly effectively predicted the changes in EEG activity due to differences in musical tempo, but this was reduced in older adults compared to younger adults.

Here, we introduce ATOMICA, a geometric deep learning model that learns atomic-scale representations of intermolecular interfaces across five modalities, including proteins, small molecules, metal ions, lipids, and nucleic acids. ATOMICA is trained on 2,037,972 interaction complexes using self-supervised denoising and masking to generate embeddings of interaction interfaces at the levels of atoms, chemical blocks, and molecular interfaces. ATOMICA's latent space is compositional and captures physicochemical features shared across molecular classes, enabling representations of new molecular interactions to be generated by algebraically combining embeddings of interaction interfaces. The representation quality of this space improves with increased data volume and modality diversity. As in pre-trained natural language models, this scaling law implies predictable gains in performance as structural datasets expand. We construct modality-specific interfaceome networks, termed ATOMICANets, which connect proteins based on interaction similarity with ions, small molecules, nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins. By overlaying disease-associated proteins of 27 diseases onto ATOMICANets, we find strong associations for asthma in lipid networks and myeloid leukemia in ion networks. We use ATOMICA to annotate the dark proteome--proteins lacking known function--by predicting 2,646 uncharacterized ligand-binding sites, including putative zinc finger motifs and transmembrane cytochrome subunits.

To assess the potential role of conserved C-terminal His residues in copper coordination, we applied sortase-mediated ligation to create an expressed, murine prion protein with segmental 15N-labeling of the N-terminal domain. Pulsed EPR methods applied to a 1:1 protein:copper complex revealed both 14N and 15N couplings, consistent with simultaneous coordination of the two protein domains to the copper center. Mutagenesis studies localized C-terminal copper coordination to His176, present on the second alpha-helix. The cumulative EPR results reveal a copper coordination environment composed of three His residues from the protein's N-terminal domain, along with His176. The feasibility of these findings was tested with AlphaFold 3 simulations.

To address this bias, we analyzed DNA barcode data for 1.35 million specimens of flying insects collected using 101 Malaise traps in 27 countries across six continents. We identify those ten families that consistently contribute more than half of all specimens and species across climates, habitats, and continents. Contrary to canonical expectations, five families have inverse or non-significant latitudinal gradients while the remaining five exhibit only weak to average gradients compared to 470 other terrestrial datasets. Furthermore, precipitation seasonality, rather than temperature, emerged as the strongest climatic correlate. Overall, we thus not only reveal a surprising convergence in the globally dominant insect clades but also illustrate that key textbook concepts in macroecology need testing for poorly studied invertebrate taxa that contribute most of Earth's animal biodiversity and may behave unexpectedly.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

J.; Lopez, S.; Rogers, A.; Adkins, S.; Breitbart, M.", "abstract": "Pepper mild mottle virus (Tobamovirus capsica, PMMoV) is a plant virus in the genus Tobamovirus that infects peppers and other members of the family Solanaceae. The virus is transmitted mechanically, poses a significant threat to crops globally, and is one of the most abundant viruses found in human feces and wastewater. Two colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assays were developed to detect PMMoV, one targeting the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (PMMoV_RdRp) and the other targeting the coat protein (PMMoV_CP). Synthetic gBlock positive controls were used to determine the detection limit of each assay. PMMoV_RdRp detected PMMoV at concentrations greater than or equal to 100 copies/L, the same sensitivity as the RT-PCR assay for this gene. In contrast, the detection limit of the PMMoV_CP RT-LAMP assay was an order of magnitude greater. Both assays were specific to PMMoV and did not amplify plant host tissue or related tobamoviruses. Since these RT-LAMP assays do not require specialized laboratory equipment and yield positive results within 20-30 minutes, they are advantageous for point-of-use testing. Overall, the RT-LAMP assays described here are sensitive, specific, and more rapid than existing methods for PMMoV detection and quantification and thus have potential widespread applications for agriculture, wastewater treatment assessment, recreational water quality testing, and food safety.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

In mammalian cerebellum, three types of astroglial cells -Bergmann glial cells (BGs), inner granule cell layer (IGL) astrocytes, and white matter (WM) astrocytes- arise in postnatal timing from two types of progenitors: Bergmann glia-like progenitors (BGLPs) and astrocyte-like progenitors (AsLPs). While BGLPs are known to differentiate into BGs and IGL astrocytes in postnatal day 6 (P6) mice, their fate immediately after birth remains unclear due to technical challenges in specifically labeling BGLPs. In this study, we demonstrated that both BGLPs and AsLPs gradually decrease from P0 to P10. Using in vivo electroporation to label BGLPs, we found that BGLPs in P0 mice differentiate not only into BGs, IGL astrocytes but also WM astrocytes. Using spatial transcriptomics analysis (Xenium, 5k),we achieved the isolation and comparative profiling of BGLP clusters from P0 and P6 mice. This analysis revealed that P0 BGLPs exhibit more stem cell-like features, while P6 BGLPs show a shift toward BG-like characteristics. These findings indicate that BGLPs immediately after birth possess higher pluripotency than previously recognized.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Static posture control in fish remains poorly explored. Recent studies have shown that larval zebrafish perform body flexion during slight roll tilts: the body flexion displaces a gas-filled swim bladder, generating counter-rotation torque for postural recovery through misalignment of gravity and buoyancy forces. Swim bladder deflation impairs this postural recovery, suggesting its critical role. This static posture control strategy may be utilized by many fish species. However, adult fish differ from larvae in morphology and behavior, raising questions about the generality of this mechanism. Our behavioral analysis showed that adult zebrafish also flexed their body during roll tilts, with flexion persisting until recovery to an upright posture. Similarly to larvae, swim bladder deflation impaired postural recovery. These results demonstrate that adult fish employ static roll posture control through body flexion and suggest the generality of this mechanism in fish species.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce the SAFE Labs Handbook: a collection of thirty \"commitments\" which can be verifiably actioned without requiring institutional support. These commitments were collaboratively developed by thirteen group leaders in life sciences, from institutions across eight countries, instigated through the 2024 SAFE Labs workshop. The importance of each commitment has been scored by more than 200 researchers, at various career stages, from more than twenty countries. Even though all commitments were rated as significantly important by scientists from all career stages, implementation rates were notably low (< 25%). Lab members reported higher importance scores than group leaders, with large divergences indicating where group leaders may underestimate the potential impact on lab culture. Indeed, the overall implementation rate was correlated with importance score for group leaders, but not lab members. Strikingly, more than 95% of group leaders said they would consider implementing the handbook commitments. Given the high importance-scores and low-implementation rates, the SAFE Labs Handbook represents a unique, community-driven tool with significant potential to improve lab culture on a global scale.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

D.; Muegge, B. D.", "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics (ST) promises to reveal the principles of tissue organization and regional variation in cellular gene expression programs. With the advent of the VisiumHD platform that measures the full cellular transcriptome in barcoded 2 m capture ''spots'', new approaches are urgently needed that faithfully assign transcripts to individual cells and enable the identification and analysis of cell type or gene expression gradients along complex tissue structures. Here we introduce the Segmentation and Manifold UnRolling Framework (SMURF), a computational tool for the analysis of high-resolution ST data. SMURF introduces a novel ''soft-segmentation'' approach that accurately aggregates and assigns the mRNAs captured and barcoded in each spot to nearby nuclei. mRNAs from multiple capture spots can be assigned to a single nucleus, and conversely, mRNAs from a single capture spot may be partitioned and assigned to multiple neighboring nuclei. We demonstrate that this algorithm achieves single-cell resolution of ST data without requiring single-cell reference data. SMURF is also able to ``unroll'' cells contained in complex tissue structures and place them on standard Cartesian coordinates, thus empowering studies of cellular organization and regional specification. We deployed SMURF in the complex mouse small intestine, revealing the functional organization of the ileal epithelium along the crypt-villus axis for all major epithelial cell types. We used SMURF to investigate an important outstanding question -- how are the functionally important proximal-to-distal gene expression gradients determined during development? Are the gradients hardwired into the stem cells at the base of the crypt, or do tip cells respond to external signals from their environments? We discovered that regionally specific gene programs along the proximal-distal axis accumulate in the epithelial villus tip and that tip cell gene expression is reprogrammed when a segment of the distal small intestine is surgically moved to a proximal location in an adult mouse. These results suggest that luminal environmental signals are a major determinant of regional transcriptional identity. SMURF promises to accelerate the effective use of high-resolution ST data by enabling more accurate segmentation and assignment of mRNAs to cells and by providing a unique toolbox for the analysis of regional transcriptional programs along tissue manifolds.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

While it is evident that motor abilities deteriorate with age, it is incorrect to assume that all aspects of movement execution are equally affected. The cerebellum, a brain region that is closely involved in motor control among other functions, undergoes clear structural changes with aging. While several studies suggest that cerebellar degeneration causes age related motor control deficits, other studies suggest that the cerebellum might act as a motor reserve and compensate for its structural degeneration, leaving cerebellar motor function intact despite cerebellar degeneration. The present study aims at thoroughly investigating the impact of age on cerebellar function across an array of tasks and domains. We investigated cerebellar motor and cognitive functions across the lifespan by examining 50 young adults (20 to 35 years), 80 older adults (55 to 70 years), and 30 older old adults (over 80 years). Participants completed a test battery comprising seven motor control tasks and one cognitive task, each designed to probe cerebellar function through different paradigms. This multi task approach allowed for a comprehensive evaluation of performance patterns, providing a balanced perspective on cerebellar function across the different age groups. In addition, we analyzed outcomes from the same tasks that, while related to movement, were not specifically linked to cerebellar function. Structural magnetic resonance imaging was also conducted to assess whether cerebellar atrophy was present in the older and older old groups compared to the young. Our results revealed that, despite age-related cerebellar degeneration, cerebellar functions in older adults remained intact compared to young adults, even in adults above 80 years old. In contrast, the sensorimotor measures that were not directly linked to cerebellar function exhibited a clear pattern of decline in older adults, and were further deteriorated in the older-old adults compared to the older adults. These findings indicate that cerebellar motor control functions remain largely preserved with age, providing compelling evidence that the cerebellum possesses a remarkable degree of functional resilience and redundancy. This suggests that cerebellar circuits may be uniquely equipped to preserve function despite structural degeneration.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

The evolutionarily conserved 128-amino acid Runt homology domain (RHD) of human RUNX2 is essential for DNA binding and heterodimerization, and serves as a mutation hotspot associated with severe CCD phenotypes. To elucidate the functional impact of pathogenic RHD mutations in vivo, we generated two novel mouse lines: one carrying a missense mutation, c.695G>A (p.R232Q) (Runx2m/+), corresponding to the human RUNX2 c.674G>A (p.R225Q), and the other harboring a frameshift mutation, c.697_698delGA (p.E233TfsTer9) (Runx2{Delta}2/+), causing a premature stop codon. Homozygous Runx2m/m and Runx2{Delta}2/{Delta}2 mice exhibited a complete loss of membranous ossification, whereas heterozygous Runx2m/+ and Runx2{Delta}2/+ mice displayed typical CCD-like skeletal features, including an open anterior fontanelle and clavicle hypoplasia. Unexpectedly, heterozygotes carrying pathogenic mutations in RHD developed an accessory root-like protrusion at the furcation of three-rooted maxillary first molars, representing a previously unrecognized dental phenotype during root development. Dual luciferase assays revealed impaired transactivation of the p.R232Q mutant Runx2 on the osteocalcin enhancer/promoter. Wild-type Runx2 was robustly expressed in osteoblasts and hypertrophic chondrocytes during bone formation, but the mutant Runx2 exhibited reduced expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes and partially impaired nuclear localization, resulting in arrested osteoblast and chondrocyte maturation.

Conversely, the geometry of structures modulates how these three aspects of organic form manifest in different taxonomic groups and ecological circumstances, raising challenges to causal inferences. Here, I apply the familiar logarithmic helicospiral (logspiral) model for coiled shells, to assess its fit to data on gastropod shells and to study allometry, covariation and constraint in coiling behavior, in light of adaptationist and proximate mechanistic explanations. I derive convenient expressions for the three-way relation between expansion rate, apical angle and downward lead angle of spiral paths on shells. Combining several published datasets, I demonstrate that centerline spirals of gastropod shells are well-approximated by isometrically growing conical logspirals. Allometry manifests in the relative growth of apertures. Derived expressions also impose underappreciated covariation in coiling parameters. Specifically, I show that the inverse relation between spire-height and expansion rate, usually attributed to economical and mechanical demands, can equally be explained by taxon-specific lead angles and variation in growth (shell expansion). I further discuss my results in the context of two recently suggested mechanistic drivers of coiling -- mismatch of shell and soft-body growth, or differential rates and directions of cellular processes at the mantle edge. More generally, geometry dictates particular \"laws of form\" for biological structures that have practical use in data analyses and integration and that need to be fully acknowledged when seeking causal adaptationist or mechanistic explanations.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

All A. baumannii genomes surveyed encode multiple DcaP family porins, which we classify in four classes based on protein sequence phylogeny (DcaP1-4). DcaP proteins encoded by species in other genera could not be mapped to these DcaP classes and phylogenetic analysis suggests DcaP1-4 proteins diversified within Acinetobacter. Phenotypic array assays and additional experiments show that DcaP3 was necessary for growth on multiple di- and tri-carboxylic acids as sole carbon sources, including citric acid and tricarballylic acid. Finally, a mutant lacking all DcaP proteins was attenuated in the liver and spleen in a mouse model of bloodstream infection and complemented by expression of DcaP3.

Yet, the mechanisms underlying its age-related upregulation remain poorly understood. Here, we examine how Cdc42 levels change over successive divisions in budding yeast, which undergoes asymmetric cell division, leading to aging predominantly in mother cells. Using microfluidics-based live-cell imaging and genetic analyses, we find that Cdc42 protein is unevenly distributed between mother and daughter cells during division. Notably, daughter cells inherit lower levels of Cdc42, which helps them rejuvenate. This asymmetry depends on Cdc42s association with endomembranes and requires the presence of farnesylated Ydj1, an Hsp40/DnaJ chaperone tethered to the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, maintaining proper Cdc42 levels relies on its interaction with Ydj1. These findings reveal a chaperone-mediated mechanism that controls Cdc42 partitioning during asymmetric division, linking it to cellular aging--a process that may be conserved in other asymmetrically dividing cells.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

This latter process is facilitated by the unique trilaminate structure of the OHC lateral wall, which consists of the plasma membrane that is densely occupied by the transmembrane motor protein Prestin, the submembrane actin- and spectrin-based cytoskeleton, and the endomembranous subsurface cisternae. This complex system provides mechanical resilience while allowing for cell expansion and contraction during electromotility. Whereas the ultrastructure of the lateral wall is well described, its molecular architecture remains largely elusive. Here, we identified Paralemmin-3 (Palm3) as a novel protein specifically localized to the lateral walls of auditory HCs to play a crucial role in connecting the plasma membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton and subsurface cisternae. Palm3-KO mice display early-onset and progressive hearing impairment that results from diminished cochlear amplification. Subsequent multiscale morphological analyses revealed structural collapse of OHCs that led to progressive and extensive OHC loss along the tonotopic axis. Palm3-KO OHCs exhibited disrupted expression and distribution of several membrane-associated proteins - including spectrin isoforms and Prestin - suggesting an essential role of Palm3 in plasma membrane scaffolding. Electron tomography of OHC lateral walls revealed significantly fewer and structurally perturbed subsurface cisternae. Finally, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated rescue of Palm3 during early postnatal development partly restored hearing function, enhanced OHC survival, and restored OHC cell shape as well as membrane protein expression levels. In summary, Palm3 is a key component of the submembrane cytoskeleton in cochlear hair cells, playing a fundamental role in hair cell biology and hearing, and emerges as an attractive candidate for the long-elusive \"pillar\" component of the hair cell lateral wall ultrastructure.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Our analysis reveals that B. mori CCAN assembles via atypical histone-fold protein dimerization into a self-contained, head-to-head dimer that topologically entraps and loops DNA, creating a point-centromere-like architecture. This structure also incorporates four previously uncharacterized Centromeric Subunit proteins that are evolutionarily repurposed from the outer kinetochore Dam1/DASH complex.

Associated lower lactate and pyruvate levels in such conditions motivated us to examine their pyruvate kinase M2 expression, which showed nuclear and cytoplasmic localization in softer and stiffer environments respectively. Pharmacologically impairing PKM2 activity in stiffer substrata decreased migration and shape polarization of cancer cells while increasing lactate and pyruvate levels. In contrast, increasing its activity on softer substrata attenuated cancer cell migration and elongation. We assayed for localization of the mechanosensory protein YAP upon PKM2 activity modulation: PKM2 activation increased nuclear YAP localization on soft substrata. Pharmacologically inhibiting YAP on stiff substrata not just decreased migration but also increased nuclear localization of PKM2 and lactate and pyruvate levels. We propose that a reciprocal repartitioning of PKM2-YAP interlinks the cognate metabolic and migrational states of cancer cells; targeting such positive feedback may hold the key to future therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Cancer cells exhibit altered and rapid metabolism, and in a process known as aerobic glycolysis, they metabolize glucose to lactate even in the presence of sufficient oxygen. Altered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, making it a promising therapeutic target. There are many potential inhibitors of cancer cell metabolism, including auranofin and syrosingopine. Auranofin induces oxidative stress in cells by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Meanwhile, syrosingopine is an inhibitor of the two lactate transporters, MCT1 and MCT4, which contribute to intracellular acidification. Our studies demonstrated the high biological activity of the combination of auranofin and syrosingopine against pancreatic cancer in both in vitro and in vivo models. Our proposed mechanism of action for this drug combination is based on the simultaneous induction of oxidative stress and inhibition of lactate transporters, which consequently directs cancer cells to the apoptosis pathway.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

To over-come these challenges, we tested whether LSCs have dependencies on PI3 kinase (PI3K). We found that LSCs are susceptible to isoform-selective targeting of PI3K and are particularly dependent on the P110 alpha isoform of PI3K. We discovered that PI3K inactivation leads to dynamic changes in EZH2/PRC2 function in leukemic cells, and we uncovered downregulation of EZH2 protein levels as a resistance mechanism in re-sponse to PI3K inhibition. We found that PI3K inhibition in AML cells can lead to compensatory upregula-tion of EZH1, and that EZH1 knockdown can sensitize AML cells to PI3K inhibition. We leveraged this re-sistance mechanism by combining a PI3K inhibitor with an EZH1/2 dual inhibitor, which successfully over-comes the acquired resistance and leads to sustained targeting of AML cells ex vivo and in murine AML and PDX models in vivo.

This study investigated whether prefrontal hemodynamic responses, measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), are associated with the effects of anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on swimming performance. In a double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover design, eight trained male swimmers performed 100 m freestyle trials under both anodal tDCS and sham conditions. We recorded prefrontal cortical activation and functional connectivity using fNIRS during a resting-state period and a subsequent stimulation period. While tDCS led to a numerical improvement in 100 m freestyle time, the overall effect was not statistically significant. The fNIRS analyses revealed that tDCS significantly reduced intra-hemispheric functional connectivity, especially in the stimulated left prefrontal cortex. Crucially, the magnitude of this connectivity reduction correlated with the degree of performance improvement, suggesting a direct brain-behavior link. Exploratory analyses further suggested that baseline functional connectivity could predict an individual's neural response to tDCS, with those having higher baseline connectivity showing a greater reduction. These findings suggest that tDCS over the left DLPFC may enhance physical performance by increasing the neural efficiency of prefrontal networks. Therefore, baseline functional connectivity is a promising physiological biomarker that could be used to personalize neuromodulation protocols in athletes.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Beyond regional comparisons, recent research has revealed inter-regional brain relationships via graph theory of brain network connectivity. Within these networks, path length measures a network's efficiency in communication. These connections can be quantified as inter-subject covariance networks related to functional connectivity, with alterations reported in neurodegenerative diseases. Methods Retrospective analysis of ADNI 18F-FDG PET images using metabolic covariance analysis and hierarchical clustering was used to assess regional brain networks in subjects from cognitively normal (CN) to AD. We evaluated AD stage changes by calculating whole brain entropy, connection strength, and clustering coefficients. Additionally, estimates of shortest path for positive and negative correlations as a measure of network efficiency. We also developed a novel region set enrichment analysis (RSEA) to detect brain functional changes based on metabolic variations. Results were aligned with transcriptomic signatures and clinical cognitive assessments. Findings In AD subjects, whole brain metabolic connectivity revealed an increase in entropy, connection strength, and clustering coefficients, which indicates brain network reorganization as compensatory mechanisms of pathological disruption. As AD advances, path lengths between brain regions decrease from CN to MCI; however, path lengths significantly increased in AD. RSEA indicated functional changes in motor, memory, language, and cognition functions related to disease progression.

Heterozygous R221W carriers (n = 11) and age-, sex-, education-matched controls (n = 11) diffusion tensor imaging data were compared using fixel-based analysis, and complimentary edge and node analyses using graph theory, and network-based statistics. Whole-brain and region of interest (ROI) fixel-based analyses revealed significantly reduced fibre density and fibre-bundle cross-section in brainstem motor tracts of R221W carriers, encompassing the corticospinal pathways, corona radiata, external capsule, cerebellar peduncles, and pontine crossing (p < 0.05). Graph theory analysis of pain-processing ROIs demonstrated reduced local efficiency in right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and altered betweenness centrality in bilateral insula and left ACC of R221W carriers. Despite R221W carriers showing higher node degrees in the somatosensory cortex and ACC, these connections had reduced efficiency and integration with cortical network regions. Network-based statistics identified a possible compensatory subnetwork with stronger connectivity from right thalamus to left ACC and left insula in R221W carriers (p < 0.019). These findings suggest that congenitally reduced peripheral nociception could lead to abnormalities in the thalamocortical and motor efferent pathway, but not sensory afferent pathways.

Potential biomarkers of rTMS response include target FC with the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (SGC) or the causal depression circuit (CDC), each of which may be candidates for individualized functional targets (iFTs). We assessed the relationship of these two approaches to clinical outcomes in two large rTMS clinical trials. Methods 501 subjects with moderate to severe depression underwent 4-6 weeks of daily rTMS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), targeted using neuronavigation to a common group-based functional target.

Here we investigated whether the auditory cortex of deaf individuals can implement higher-order cognitive functions when its sensory input is absent or significantly reduced. Crossmodal plasticity research has shown that auditory areas of the human brain are recruited for executive processing tasks in deaf individuals (Cardin et al., 2018; Ding et al., 2015; Manini et al., 2022; Zimmermann et al., 2021). What is the role of the auditory cortex during such executive processes in deaf individuals? One possibility is that it has a role in sensory processing, extracting information about relevant features. Alternatively, they it may represent higher-order information, such as coding task rules or modulating attentional states. To distinguish between these hypotheses, we conducted an fMRI delay-to-match experiment in either the visual or somatosensory modality in deaf (N=13) and hearing (N=18) individuals. Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) showed that the auditory cortex of deaf individuals contains information about higher-level processes such as task and sensory modality. We also found significant representations of somatosensory frequency. Critically, task and modality representations were also found in the auditory cortex of hearing individuals. These findings suggest that crossmodal plasticity relies on the enhancement of representations that are present in hearing individuals, rather than through the implementation of novel ones. In conclusion, we show that sensory experience shapes cognitive processing and the function of sensory regions in the brain, and that the functional destiny of cortical regions can be shaped by early sensory experience.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional profiles of skin and blood T-cell responses and their role in immunity in 73 dengue patients and 10 healthy volunteers. We show that the skin T-cell compartment undergoes dramatic reshaping compared to the blood of dengue patients. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses were highly enriched in the skin compared to the blood of the same patients, and skin-based T-cells expressed markers associated with tissue-resident T (TRM) cells. While the magnitude of the CD4+ T-cell response in the skin was independent to that in the blood, CD8+ T-cell responses in skin and blood were positively correlated. Activated CD8+ T-cells in the skin expressed a core transcriptional signature of TRM cells, further supporting their differentiation to the TRM lineage during infection. The magnitude of both skin and blood CD8+ T-cell responses was associated with protection from hospitalization in this cohort. These data collectively support a protective role of skin-resident and circulating CD8+ T-cells in dengue and provide insights into the biology of TRM cells in human infection.

The kinetics of restoring these marks on newly incorporated histones dictate how quickly genomic domains regain their epigenetic identity after replication. H3K9me3 is restored extremely slowly; the process of reconstitution, to achieve the pre-replication levels, continues throughout the following G1 phase. The molecular mechanisms behind this slow reconstitution are unknown. We show here that RIF1's reassociation with heterochromatin during mitotic exit is required to set up a chromatin environment permissive for histone methyltransferases to resume H3K9me3 deposition. RIF1 facilitates the recruitment of SUV39H1, HP1 and HP1{beta} and is required for the increased tri-methylation of H3K9 that occurs during G1 PHASE. RIF1 is also indispensable for recruiting Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) to heterochromatin, and the interaction between RIF1 and PP1 is essential for the maintenance of H3K9me3 levels. In addition, RIF1-PP1 complex temporally restrains the activity of Aurora kinase at heterochromatin, ensuring that phosphorylation of H3S10 does not precede replication. This creates a time- window permissive for SUV39Hs to initiate the reinstatement of H3K9me3.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Here, I present a sequential Monte Carlo method that incrementally updates key parameters of a stochastic compartmental epidemic model as new incidence data are collected daily. My approach couples a Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm for disease epidemiology with a memory-based particle-resampling scheme that allows real-time inference of primary and secondary infection rates even when observed infection counts are low. Using a synthetic outbreak to mimic typical field epidemics, I show that posterior means for transmission parameters converge to within an average of {approx} 10% of true values by Days 10-15 post-introduction. Concurrently, ensemble-based short-term forecasts achieve R2 {approx} 0.8 by Day 2 and exceed R2 {approx} 0.93 by Day 30. Computational costs remain modest; each daily update completes in under 4 seconds on standard hardware, highlighting the feasibility of integrating this method into automated surveillance platforms. While validation against synthetic data shows strong performance, I discuss potential challenges in real-world applications, including real data, model misspecification, latent infection dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity.

We sought to identify genetic changes associated with tumor evolution in response to therapy through multi-timepoint whole-genome/whole-exome sequencing of 206 IDH-mutant glioma patient samples collected through the Glioma Longitudinal Analysis (GLASS) Consortium. We validated known genomic markers of tumor progression, including hypermutation and CDKN2A homozygous deletion, and discovered novel genetic alterations that distinguish the response to treatment in astrocytomas compared to oligodendrogliomas. Point mutations in PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and NOTCH1 were newly acquired in recurrent oligodendrogliomas and associated with increased mutation rates. Focal oncogene amplifications, together with CDKN2A homozygous deletions, were associated with an increase in recurrence-specific chromosomal imbalances in astrocytomas. Mutational signature analysis revealed additional differences and detected enrichment for the SBS11, and SBS119 mutational signatures after temozolomide treatment in both IDH-glioma subtypes, whereas astrocytomas showed increased ID8 signatures after radiotherapy.

However, the link between glycosylation defects and cortical brain network pathology remains elusive. Methods: To address this unmet need, we generated iPSC derived human cortical organoids (hCOs) for ALG13-CDG, which is the second most common CDG that is also X-linked. To comprehensively understand the impact of glycosylation defects on cortical pathology in CDG, we combined electrophysiological recordings using multi-electrode arrays (MEA) with comprehensive molecular profiling via multiomics, including scRNA-seq, proteomics, glycoproteomics, N-glycan imaging, lipidomics, and metabolomics. X-inactivation status was also evaluated in both iPSCs and organoids. Results: ALG13-CDG hCOs revealed reduced glycosylation of proteins critical for extracellular matrix (ECM), neuronal migration, lipid metabolism, calcium ion homeostasis, and neuronal excitability. Dysregulation in related pathways was corroborated by proteomics and scRNA-seq, which also showed altered communication patterns in these pathways. Trajectory analysis revealed an inversion in neuronal development, with early inhibitory and delayed excitatory development, indicating an excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) imbalance. MEA recordings demonstrated early network hypoactivity with reduced firing rates, immature burst dynamics, and shorter axonal extensions. Despite this, transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed upregulation of excitatory receptors suggesting latent hyperexcitability. Altered lipid and sugar (GlcNAc) metabolism and skewed X-inactivation were also observed. Conclusions: Our study provides the first evidence of glycosylation defects in an ALG13-CDG human cortical organoid (hCO) model and links these defects to disrupted neuronal developmental trajectories and dysregulation of key pathways essential for brain function. We identify mistimed neuronal maturation and an excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance as early drivers of network hypoactivity and immature burst dynamics, with downstream compensatory hyperexcitability that may contribute to seizure susceptibility. While specific to ALG13-CDG, these mechanisms likely extend to other glycosylation disorders with overlapping neurological features.

By proofreading and automated segmentation, we reconstructed and classified all soma-containing neurons--including 1,815 pyramidal cells and 229 inhibitory cells--and over 55,000 MFs. Pyramidal cells receive more numerous MF inputs along a proximodistal gradient. Some distal cells show surprisingly high convergence via relatively small terminals with fewer vesicles. Pyramidal cells share significantly more MF inputs than networks randomized by degree-preserving swap, and are better approximated by networks randomized by proximity-preserving swap. We identify a feedforward inhibitory circuit from MFs via perisomatic interneurons that selectively target a pyramidal subtype. We demonstrated large-scale mapping across levels in the hippocampus--from circuits to cell types to vesicles.

Despite this, vaccine development is hindered by our limited understanding of protective immunity, particularly in the context of recurrent infections and immune-mediated pathology. Here, we characterised mucosal inflammation and systemic immune responses to C. trachomatis in South African AGYW (n=145), stratified by exposure history based on nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) and anti-C. trachomatis IgG levels. Cervicovaginal cytokines were quantified from menstrual cup secretions, and cervical and peripheral blood T cell activation assessed by flow cytometry. CD4+ T cell responses to recombinant MOMP were measured in a subset of 46 women who were NAAT-positive and/or seropositive. Untreated or recurrent C. trachomatis infection (NAAT+/IgG+) was associated with increased cervical T cell activation. All women with untreated or recurrent infections had detectable circulating C. trachomatis-specific CD4+ T cells in blood; however, response magnitude was 2.4-fold lower than in women with cleared or primary infections. Women with cleared infection had the highest proportions of C. trachomatis-specific multifunctional CD4+ T cells, while those with untreated or recurrent infections had almost none. Notably, systemic C. trachomatis-specific Th1 responses were inversely correlated with genital tract concentrations of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1{beta}, TNF, and IL-17. These findings demonstrate that both the magnitude and quality of the systemic CD4+ T cell responses are critical components of protective immunity to C. trachomatis and may limit mucosal immunopathology, which has important implications for vaccine strategies and evaluation in high-risk populations.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

In England, large scale badger culling has been implemented since 2013 as part of a licenced Badger Control Policy (BCP). While several studies have shown an association between the BCP and disease benefits in cattle, a study by Langton et al. (2022) failed to identify any evidence of such benefits, raising questions about the effectiveness of badger culling as a tool for disease control. In this study I summarise the primary methodology used in the Langton et al. study and identify two significant issues with the approach used, which compares cattle TB incidence in culled areas of SW England to land without culling. Firstly, their analysis groups data together from cull areas into a combined culled vs unculled treatment, regardless of the time that culling has been applied. Secondly, there is evidence of a clear cull area selection bias, such that land enrolled into culling during the period analysed had a significantly higher baseline TB incidence than areas not culling. I then conducted a Monte Carlo analysis using simulated data under scenarios with differing cull effects, and matching the degree of grouping, selection bias and statistical methods used by Langton et al. (2022). The results indicate that even in scenarios with a relatively rapid and large effect of culling seeded into the simulation there is a significant probability that their analyses will fail to find an effect and may even wrongly conclude that culling is associated with an increase in TB. These results potentially explain the discrepancy between Langton et al. (2022) and other studies evaluating badger culling and highlight the importance of rigorous statistical analysis that accounts for temporal and spatial patterns in disease control data.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

While this prediction is mathematically robust under simplifying assumptions, accumulating evidence suggests that the structure of gene interaction networks can alter both the rate and organization of incompatibility evolution. Here, we extend classic DMI models with a network approach, equating the assumptions of the Orr model with a complete graph of gene interactions. We simulate the evolution of hybrid incompatibilities under different gene interaction networks and evaluate the effects of network density, topology, and substitution model. We find that network density strongly governs the rate of DMI accumulation, particularly under models permitting multiple substitutions per locus, while network topology shapes the agglomeration of incompatibilities into large, connected clusters. Substitution rate heterogeneity, especially when anti-correlated with node degree, further suppresses both accumulation and clustering. These results highlight that while the snowball effect remains qualitatively valid, the structure and evolution of the incompatibility network exhibit nontrivial departures from previous expectations, with implications for observable quantities in empirical systems. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating genomic architecture and network constraints into models of speciation.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

These interactions can support the persistence of resistant cells even in the absence of treatment, undermining standard aggressive therapies and motivating drug holiday-based approaches that leverage ecological dynamics. A key challenge in implementing such strategies is efficiently identifying interaction between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subpopulations. Evolutionary game theory provides a framework for characterizing these interactions. We investigate whether spatial patterns in single time-point images of cell populations can reveal the underlying game theoretic interactions between sensitive and resistant cells. To achieve this goal, we develop an agent-based model in which cell reproduction is governed by local game-theoretic interactions. We compute a suite of spatial statistics on single time-point images from the agent-based model under a range of games being played between cells. We quantify the informativeness of each spatial statistic and demonstrate that a simple machine learning model can classify the type of game being played.

E.; Campbell, J. R.; LeGates, T. A.", "abstract": "Background: Chronic alcohol exposure is a major driver of alcohol use disorders (AUD), in part through its ability to induce maladaptive plasticity within neural circuits that regulate reward, motivation, and affect. Excitatory projections from the hippocampus (Hipp) to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) play a pivotal role in regulating reward-related behaviors, and this pathway serves as a key locus for establishing associations between rewarding stimuli and related contextual information. Regulation of the strength of Hipp-NAc synapses is critical for supporting these behaviors, and aberrant Hipp-NAc plasticity is associated with anhedonia and disrupted reward learning. Methods: To examine acute ethanol effects, we used whole-cell electrophysiology to record Hipp-NAc synaptic plasticity in acute brain slices in the presence or absence of 50mM ethanol. To examine the effects of chronic ethanol administration, mice were exposed to ethanol vapor in a 3-week chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) paradigm. Slices from ethanol and air exposed mice were used for whole-cell electrophysiology to record Hipp-NAc synaptic plasticity. Results: Here, we demonstrate that acute ethanol application to ex vivo brain slices prevents long-term potentiation (LTP) at Hipp-NAc synapses, without altering presynaptic release probability. Furthermore, chronic intermittent exposure to ethanol abolishes LTP at these synapses, even during abstinence, indicating persistent synaptic dysfunction. Conclusions: Together, our findings demonstrate that ethanol has immediate and long-lasting effects on Hipp-NAc plasticity. Given the behavioral relevance of these synapses, this work has important implications for the mechanisms underlying ethanol-dependent effects on reward processing and negative affective states associated with AUD.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Thus, CXCR4 targeting is explored using various approaches, including small molecules, antibodies, and short peptides. Here, we investigated the antitumor effects of the CXCR4 pharmacological inhibition with the synthetic peptides SPX5551 and balixafortide, as single agents and in combination, in various B-cell lymphoma models. Methods: Binding modalities were assessed via molecular docking and simulation. In vitro assays evaluated single-agent and combinatorial effects of CXCR4 antagonists with BTK, PI3K, and conventional therapies across 20 lymphoma cell lines, including models with acquired resistance. Transcriptomic analyses and mechanistic studies elucidated the pathways modulated by combined CXCR4 and BTK inhibition. Results: Structural modeling confirmed similar CXCR4 binding modes for SPX5551 and balixafortide. SPX5551 displayed minimal single-agent activity but restored sensitivity to BTK and PI3K inhibitors in resistant marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) models. Across mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) models, SPX5551 enhanced the efficacy and/or potency of ibrutinib, copanlisib, rituximab, and R-CHOP. In MCL, co-treatment with SPX5551 and ibrutinib synergistically induced apoptosis, inhibited NF-{kappa}B and AKT signaling, and led to broader transcriptomic repression of tumor-promoting pathways compared to either agent alone. Conclusions: Although CXCR4 inhibitors alone show limited cytotoxicity, their combination with standard and targeted therapies significantly enhances anti-lymphoma effects, particularly in drug-resistant settings.

Adolescent animals had greater novelty-induced locomotor activity, greater novelty preference, and showed higher approach and exploratory behaviors compared to preadolescent and adult animals.

However, empirically dissecting this continuum poses challenges for species delimitation, particularly in rapid radiations marked by recent divergence, incomplete lineage sorting, and gene flow. The species-rich Sinocyclocheilus cavefish radiation of Southwest China, an emerging evolutionary multi-species model system, shows a notable mismatch between its high morphological diversity and the limited divergence observed in commonly used mitochondrial DNA markers. This pattern suggests that true species richness may be underestimated. Yet, comprehensive genome-wide approaches to resolve species boundaries in this group are still lacking. To address this, we combine phylogenomics, coalescent-based species delimitation, population genetics, and historical biogeography, using both genome-wide RAD-seq and multi-locus Sanger data (including nuclear and mitochondrial DNA). Our phylogenomic analyses resolve major clades and reveal substantial cryptic diversity, well beyond what was detected by earlier markers. Species delimitation based on RAD-seq genomic data identifies several cryptic evolutionary lineages. We recover a dynamic divergence history shaped by isolation and episodic connectivity. Biogeographic reconstruction supports a mid-Miocene origin following a major vicariance event, with subsequent founder-event dispersals into subterranean habitats. This long history of fragmentation is further complicated by reticulation and ancestral polymorphism, and is reflected in present-day patterns of restricted gene flow across river valleys.

Here we demonstrate that mouse responses to visual depth cues are more sophisticated than previously recognized, involving both direct avoidance behaviors and complex modulations of exploratory patterns. By combining a modified circular apparatus with Hidden Markov Model analysis, we reveal that mice transition between three distinct behavioral states-resting, exploring, and navigating-in response to visual depth cues. Using this framework, we uncover several fundamental aspects of mouse visual processing: depth perception has an optimal range of spatial frequencies, with strongest responses to patterns between 6-8 cm; visual processing integrates multiple spatial cues rather than triggering simple avoidance; and initial strong cliff-avoidance responses evolve into more nuanced behavioral adaptations over time. Comparisons between wild-type C57BL/6J mice (Mus musculus), retinal degeneration models (rd1-2J, C57BL/6J background, Mus musculus), and control conditions confirm that these behavioral patterns specifically reflect visual processing rather than general exploratory behavior. These findings reveal that mouse depth perception involves sophisticated neural processing that modulates overall exploratory behavior rather than simply triggering avoidance responses.

Here, we test for paternal effects in the gynogenetic Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa): a naturally clonal, all-female species with no parental care. Using a highly controlled breeding experiment involving 59 Atlantic molly males (P. mexicana) and 57 Amazon molly females, we generated 169 broods and 2,966 offspring. While males were drawn from a naturally variable stock population, females - next to being genetically identical - were highly standardized for age, size, descent, and developmental experience.

While we found substantial variation in both offspring size and brood size, we found no evidence for paternal effects on either trait.

P.; Prayugo, V.; Taylor, L. N.; Shapiro, M.; Dolezal, A. G.", "abstract": "Seasonal variation strongly influences honey bee colony dynamics, leading to time-dependent changes in behavioral and physiological phenotypes. However, the extent to which seasonal fluctuations affect the susceptibility and tolerance of honey bees to viral infection remains largely unexplored. To address this, we conducted a longitudinal study in which adult honey bee workers were collected monthly from research colonies and experimentally infected with Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) over the course of a year. Our results showed significant seasonal variation in the mortality and IAPV load of inoculated bees, with bees challenged during the pre-overwintering period (i.e., fall) exhibiting the highest susceptibility and lowest tolerance to IAPV infection compared to bees challenged in spring, summer, or winter. To investigate factors underlying these seasonal differences, we conducted nutrition-based studies that determined: 1) the variation in lipid content of colonies throughout the year and its potential link to our observed trends in IAPV tolerance, and 2) the impact of seasonally collected pollen on the survivorship of IAPV-challenged bees. Our findings support that seasonal changes in honey bee physiology and nutritional status play key roles in influencing honey bee viral tolerance. We conclude that honey bee colonies are particularly vulnerable to viral infection during the pre-overwintering period, most likely as a result of reduced tolerance to pathogen stress when transitioning from a summer to winter worker population. We further hypothesize that this period of increased vulnerability to viral infection, in correlation with other disease factors such as Varroa mite abundance and available forage, likely contributes to the relatively high overwintering losses experienced by beekeepers. Given the recent reports of severe colony losses attributed to honey bee viruses, understanding the relationship between seasonality and viral tolerance in honey bees is crucial for better informing management strategies and improving overwintering success.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

The anaesthetic condition was characterised by weak functional networks that were more similar to anatomical structure and more fragmented than during wakeful rest. Conversely, the awake condition was characterised by coordinated network reconfiguration and more distinct subnetwork composition.

In this study, we extend the Phillips-Robinson model by introducing circadian-dependent dynamic thresholds for sleep and wake transitions, yielding a more physiologically grounded framework for sleep regulation. Using bifurcation analysis, we show that the transition from sustained wakefulness to rhythmic sleep-wake cycles is governed by a saddle-node on invariant circle (SNIC) bifurcation, and that these oscillations become entrained to external 24 h light-dark cues. We analytically derive circadian-modulated sleep and wake thresholds, revealing how the interaction between circadian and homeostatic drives governs sleep-wake transitions. Our model captures key physiological phenomena, including: (1) the onset and entrainment of sleep-wake rhythms, (2) immediate sleep onset and partial rebound following sleep deprivation, and (3) sleep fragmentation under shift work-like conditions.

S.; Nenning, K.-H.; Byeon, K.; Xu, T.; Vogelstein, J.", "abstract": "Sex classification using neuroimaging data has the potential to revolutionize personalized diagnostics by revealing subtle structural brain differences that underlie sex-specific disease risks. Despite the promise of machine learning, traditional methods often fall short in providing both high classification accuracy and interpretable, statistically validated feature importance scores for high-dimensional imaging data. This gap is particularly evident when conventional techniques such as random forests, LIME, and SHAP are applied, as they struggle with complex feature interactions and managing noise in large datasets. We address this challenge by developing an integrated framework that combines Oblique Random Forests (ORFs) with a novel, permutation-based feature importance testing algorithm. ORFs extend traditional random forests by employing oblique decision boundaries through linear combinations of features, thereby capturing intricate interactions inherent in neuroimaging data. Our feature importance testing method, NEOFIT, rigorously quantifies the significance of each feature by generating null distributions and corrected p-values. We first validate our approach using simulated datasets, establishing its robustness and scalability under controlled conditions. We then apply our method to classify sex from both voxel-wise structural MRI and cortical thickness data in humans and macaques, facilitating direct cross-species comparisons. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only enhances classification performance but also provides clear, interpretable insights into the neuroanatomical features that distinguish sexes.

G.", "abstract": "Understanding how neuronal networks process oscillatory inputs is key for deciphering the brain's information processing dynamics. Neuronal filters describe the frequency-dependent relationship of neuronal outputs (e.g., membrane potential amplitude, firing rate) and their inputs for the level of neuronal organization (e.g., cellular, network) considered. Band-pass filters are associated to the notion of resonance and reflect the system's ability to respond maximally to inputs at a nonzero (resonant) frequency or a limited (resonant) frequency band. The complementary notion of phasonance refers to the ability of a system to exhibit a zero-phase response for a nonzero (phasonant) input frequency. The biophysical and dynamic mechanisms that shape neuronal filters and give raise to preferred frequency responses to oscillatory inputs are poorly understood beyond single cells. Moreover, the mechanisms that control the frequency-dependent communication of information across cells in a network remain unclear. Here, we use mathematical modeling, analytical calculations, computational simulations and dynamical systems tools to investigate how the complex and nonlinear interaction of the systems's biophysical properties and interacting time scales shape neuronal filters in minimal network models receiving oscillatory inputs with frequencies () within some range. The minimal networks consist of one directly stimulated cell (cell 1) connected to another (not directly stimulated) cell (cell 2) via graded chemical synapses. Individual cells are either passive or resonators and chemical synapses are either excitatory or inhibitory. The network outputs consist of the voltage peak envelopes and the impedance amplitude and phase profiles (as a function of ) for the two cells. We introduce the frequency-dependent amplitude () and phase {Delta}{Phi}() communication coefficients, defined as the ratio of the amplitude responses of the indirectly and directly stimulated cells and the phase difference between these two cells, respectively. Extending previous work, we also introduce the -curve, parametrized by , in the phase-space diagram for the voltage variables of the two participating cells. This curve joins the peak voltage values of the two cells in response to the oscillatory inputs and is a geometric representation of the communication coefficient. It allows to interpret the results and explain the dependence of the properties of the communication coefficient in terms of the biophysical and dynamic properties of the participating cells and synaptic connectivity when analytical calculations are not possible. We describe the conditions under which one or the two cells in the network exhibit resonance and phasonance and the conditions under which the network exhibits -resonance and {Delta}{Phi}-phasonance and more complex network responses depending as the complexity of the participating cells increases. For linear networks (linear nodes and linear connectivity),  is proportional to the impedance of the indirectly activated cell 2 and {Delta}{Phi} is equal to the phase of the indirectly stimulated cell 2, independent of the directly stimulated cell 1 in both cases. We show that the presence of nonlinear connectivity in the network creates (nonlinear) interactions between the two cells that give rise to -resonance, {Delta}{Phi}-phasonance and more complex responses that are absent in the corresponding linear networks. The results and methods developed in this paper have implications for the processing of information in more complex networks.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Why? Traditional neuroimaging studies of emotion regulation often focus on localized neural activity or isolated networks, overlooking how large-scale brain organization may shape the integration of distributed systems and sub-processes supporting regulatory success. Here, we applied a novel system-level framework based on spatial gradients of macroscale brain organization to study variance in emotion regulation success. Using two large fMRI datasets (n=358, n=263), we projected global activation patterns from a laboratory emotion regulation task onto principal gradients derived from independent resting-state fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. These gradients capture low-dimensional patterns of neural variation, providing a topographical framework within which complex mental phenomena, such as emotion regulation, emerge. In both datasets, individual differences in regulation success were predicted by systematic reconfiguration along Gradient 1, a principal axis differentiating unimodal and heteromodal brain areas. This gradient-based neural reconfiguration also predicted lower negative affect in daily life, as measured via smartphone-based experience sampling in a subset of participants (n=55). Meta-analytic decoding via Neurosynth revealed that Gradient 1 and regulation success align with multiple psychological processes, including social cognition, memory, attention, and negative emotion, suggesting this gradient reflects diverse, integrative demands during effective emotion regulation. These findings advance a network-level account of regulatory success, offering a biologically grounded, ecologically valid framework for understanding adaptive emotional functioning. Such gradient-based dynamics may serve as predictive biomarkers of regulatory success and inform targeted interventions in clinical populations.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Notably, very little is known about moths in the largest city of the United States, New York City, where pervasive urban pollutants, artificial light at night, land cover change, and habitat fragmentation are severe. We examined the effects of urbanization on moth biodiversity in New York City, with a focus on green spaces. We sampled twelve locations across six parks at night and complemented these surveys with citizen science records of moths from iNaturalist. Overall, we found a negative relationship between greater urbanization and moth biodiversity, with community similarity correlated with environmental similarity. Our results support greater biodiversity with less light at night, urban development, and more deciduous tree cover and open land. Our structural equation model reveals additional insight: although we detected a strong negative direct effect of developed land, urbanization also impacts diversity via indirect effects of reducing open space and deciduous tree cover. Developed open space alone does not directly affect diversity, but may positively impact diversity through its covariance with vegetation cover.

S.; Laxman, S.", "abstract": "The biosynthetic capacity of the cell governs the production and exchange of amino acids. Amino acids have diverse metabolic origins and intracellular requirements. Therefore, to understand the cellular amino acid economy we require a quantitative understanding of intracellular and extracellular their amounts, and how distinct amino acids change temporally during growth. Using the unicellular eukaryote, yeast, we establish a quantitative blueprint of the intracellular and extracellular amino acid economy, including the fluxes of production, secretion and consumption across different growth phases. Certain amino acids dominate the intracellular pool, and proportions of distinct amino acids continuously change during growth. The extracellular pool is notably distinct from the intracellular pool in terms of composition and dynamics. Only some public amino acids are subsequently consumed, while others are secreted in surplus of cellular demands. Five amino acids are intracellular and privatized, and continuously utilized to support diverse metabolism. Through this, we establish pairs of highly effective synthetic, exchange-based communities of public good auxotrophs. Our results suggest organizing frameworks addressing the dynamic intracellular and inter-cellular amino acid economy and its trade, and informs the rational engineering of syntrophic cell communities.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Excitatory inputs converging onto dendrites engage or interact with local non-linear regenerative events, adding a computational layer that expands the variety and complexity of input-output transformations. In conjunction with non-linear conductance-mediated mechanisms, the spatial arrangement of active synapses along dendrites strategically shapes this local computation. Mapping synaptic input organization is thus critical to fully uncover neuronal input-output function. Spine calcium imaging offers a direct functional readout of the location of active contacts, but such mapping requires access to spines distributed on intricate three-dimensional dendritic trees. We present a modular software pipeline for targeted imaging and analysis of dendrites using sequential two-dimensional scanning on standard two-photon microscopes. Designed to work with conventional two-photon microscopy setups, the method is fully compatible with ScanImage. It includes a pre-acquisition tool (ROIpy) and a post-acquisition analysis suite (Spyne). ROIpy generates dendrite-aligned region-of-interests for scattered depth-specific acquisition of neuronal arborizations. Spyne includes deep-learning modules for spine identification (using DeepD3) and within-spine calcium events detection (via a custom- classifier). This method is compatible with a range of experimental designs, including simultaneous two-photon imaging and patch-clamp recordings, as well as fully optical setups. The acquisition pipeline supports plane-by-plane imaging of the whole-arbor, targeted to specific compartments or to user-defined branches of interest. Our work provides a versatile strategy for targeted dendritic imaging using two-dimensional scanning multiphoton microscopy. While ROIpy allows adaptation to diverse experimental goals beyond synaptic mapping, Spyne provides an analysis strategy for functional mapping of active synapses at single-cell resolution, offering a basis for modeling how the spatial organization of synaptic inputs shapes dendritic integration.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

S. A.; Brubaker, M. A.; Brainard, D. F.; Murray, R.

Indeed, it has proven difficult to develop image-computable models of how human vision achieves a substantial degree of lightness constancy in complex scenes. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been developed that are proficient at estimating albedo, but little is known about how they achieve this, or whether they are good models of human vision. We examined this question by training a CNN to estimate albedo and illumination in a computer-rendered virtual world, and evaluating both the CNN and human observers in a lightness matching task. In several conditions, we eliminated cues potentially supporting lightness constancy: local contrast, shading, shadows, and all contextual cues. We found that the network achieved a high degree of lightness constancy, outperforming three classic models, and substantially outperforming human observers as well. However, we also found that eliminating cues affected the CNN and humans very differently. Humans had much worse constancy when local contrast cues were made uninformative, but were minimally affected by elimination of shading or shadows. The CNN was unaffected by local contrast, but relied on shading and shadows. These results suggest that the CNN followed an effective strategy of integrating global image cues, whereas humans used a more local strategy. In a follow-up experiment, we found that the CNN could learn to exploit noise artifacts that were correlated with illuminance in ray-traced scenes, whereas humans did not. We conclude that CNNs can learn an effective, global strategy of estimating lightness, which is closer to an optimal strategy for the ensemble of scenes we studied than the computation used by human vision.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Recent theoretical work suggests that some forms of irrational decisions may arise from limited coding precision or metabolic budget in individual orbitofrontal neurons. Here, we consider the alternative possibility that systematic errors in decision-relevant computations are the inevitable consequence of the internal connectivity structure within orbitofrontal networks, which was molded under more distal biological constraints. We first trained cohorts of artificial neural networks to perform rational decision-relevant computations. Remarkably, they exhibited most electrophysiological coding properties of orbitofrontal neurons recorded in monkeys engaged in a preference-based decision task. We then distorted their internal connectivity to reproduce monkeys' irrational choices. This induced systematic interferences in decision-relevant computations that generalize across individuals, at both the behavioral and neural level. Importantly, irrational networks also display enhanced behavioral resilience to neural loss when compared to their rational counterparts. This suggests that irrational behavior may be the incidental outcome of distal evolutionary pressure on the tolerance to orbitofrontal circuit's damage.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

But pure tone audiometry (PTA) alone fails to fully explain SIN ability. This is because SIN perception is based on complex interactions between peripheral hearing, central auditory processing (CAP) and other cognitive abilities. We assessed interaction between these factors and age using a multivariate approach that allows the modelling of directional effects on theoretical constructs: structural equation modelling. We created a model to explain SIN using latent constructs for sound segregation, auditory (working) memory, and SIN perception, as well as PTA, age and measures of non-verbal reasoning. In a sample of 207 participants aged 18-81 years old, age was the biggest determinant of SIN ability, followed by auditory memory. PTA did not contribute to SIN directly, although it modified sound segregation ability, which covaried with auditory memory. A second model, using a CAP latent structure formed by measures of sound segregation, auditory memory, and temporal processing, revealed CAP to be the largest determinant of SIN ahead of age. Furthermore, we demonstrated the impact of PTA and non-verbal reasoning on SIN are mediated by their influence on CAP. Our results highlight the importance of central auditory processing in speech-in-noise perception.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Kinetochores assemble on the centromere which is epigenetically defined by the histone H3 variant CENtromere Protein A (CENP-A). During DNA replication CENP-A is equally divided between replicated chromatids and new CENP-A nucleosomes are re-assembled during the subsequent G1 phase. How cells regulate the cell cycle timing of CENP-A assembly is a central question in the epigenetic maintenance of centromeres. CENP-A nucleosome assembly requires the Mis18 complex (Mis18, Mis18{beta}, and M18BP1) which is regulated in its localization to centromeres between metaphase and G1. Here, we define a new regulatory mechanism that works through phosphorylation of Xenopus laevis M18BP1 between metaphase and interphase. This switch disrupts binding of M18BP1 to CENP-A nucleosomes in metaphase, and when relieved enables M18BP1 binding to CENP-A nucleosomes in interphase. We show that this phosphorylation dependent mechanism regulates CENP-A nucleosome assembly. We propose that the phospho-regulated binding of M18BP1 to CENP-A nucleosomes restricts new CENP-A assembly to interphase.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

However, whether and how these mechanisms interact is largely unclear. Using a contextual cueing paradigm, we investigated whether learning and exploitation of spatial predictive context can occur outside attentional focus. Repeating search scenes enabled distractor context to serve as a contextual cue predicting target location. Participants searched for a target among distractors in two colors: the same as the target-to-be-searched (attended context) or a different color (ignored context). Halfway through the experiments, we changed the target color, thereby altering the attentional status of distractor contexts while maintaining their spatial predictiveness. In Experiment 1, where participants regularly switched between target colors, we found exploitation of spatial predictive context both within and outside attentional focus. However, in Experiment 2, where attention was more stably focused on one target color, only the attended predictive context was exploited before transfer. Intriguingly, after transfer, previously ignored predictive context showed immediate benefits, revealing latent learning. These findings demonstrate a dynamic competition between selective attention and spatial predictions: while learning occurs independently of attention, exploitation may require attentional selection.

Here, we found that SLDGABA neurons function as a suppressor of wakefulness in both wild-type and narcoleptic mice. Optogenetic silencing of SLDGABA neurons rapidly induced robust wakefulness, while enhancing cortical and motor activity. Conversely, optogenetic activation of these neurons suppressed wakefulness and promoted NREM sleep. We found that SLDGABA neurons project extensively to wake-promoting brain regions, providing an anatomical basis for their wake-suppressing effects. Importantly, we discovered that SLDGABA neurons play a pathological role in narcolepsy: their activation in orexin-deficient mice triggered characteristic sleep attacks--rapid intrusions of NREM sleep during active wakefulness--while silencing these neurons rescued animals from both sleep attacks and cataplexy.

In this system, the plant hormone auxin promotes OsTIR1-mediated degradation of proteins carrying an auxin-inducible degron tag. However, \"basal\" degradation of AID-tagged proteins in the absence of auxin has hampered work with essential proteins due to defective or non-viable strains. A second-generation AID system based on the OsTIRF47G mutant was recently introduced to overcome the limitations of basal degradation in budding yeast. However, it remained unclear to what extent the use of OsTIRF47G eliminates basal degradation and how it impacts auxin-induced degradation. Here, by performing a quantitative characterization of the basal and auxin-induced degradation dynamics using OsTIR1F74G in budding yeast, we find that basal degradation is still detectable and that it depends on OsTIR1F74G expression levels. We show that also the auxin-induced degradation rates and auxin-induced steady-state concentrations of AID-tagged proteins depend on OsTIR1F74G expression levels, in addition to the type of auxin used. Lastly, we showcase how increased basal degradation of AID-tagged functional proteins can impair cell growth and lead to unwanted phenotypes.

Jaguars are particularly important to study, as they are opportunistic predators whose diet and behaviour shifts flexibly with local prey availability. We investigated the movement patterns, home range dynamics, and social interactions of jaguars (Panthera onca) on Maraca-Jipioca Island, a pair of small, seasonally flooded islands, in a low-disturbance reserve in the Brazilian Amazon. Using GPS collars, we tracked seven individuals and found that males had significantly larger home ranges (mean: 77.8 km2) than females (mean: 19.5 km2). Despite the islands limited area, home-range overlap was low, and direct encounters were rare. This mirrored the territorial behaviour seen in more expansive mainland populations, but contradicted patterns seen in other populations that specialised on aquatic prey. Jaguars on Maraca-Jipioca moved an average of 7.3 km/day, with no significant differences across sex, age, nor body size. However, movement speed and probability of activity varied significantly across habitats: individuals moved faster in grasslands, wetlands, and water, and more slowly in forests and mangroves. Animals also spent more time resting while in forests and mangroves as compared to grasslands, water, and wetlands. In contrast to the predominantly nocturnal habits reported in continental populations, jaguar activity on Maraca-Jipioca peaked during daylight hours, especially among females. Jaguars showed a marked preference for coastal areas but did not appear to adjust habitat use in response to tidal variation in sea level. Collectively, these findings suggest that the spatial ecology of Maraca-Jipioca jaguars is comprised of typical and novel behaviours, shaped by both the species evolutionary history, and the islands unique ecological context.

The hPASCs bioengineered kidney demonstrated enhanced angiogenesis and reconstructed renal architecture in vivo, by transplantation into rat models of renal subcapsular and partial nephrectomy. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and single-cell analyses revealed that the hPASCs revascularized bioengineered kidney regenerated both vascular and renal parenchymal cells within the host. This study offers another strategy for kidney bioengineering and regeneration.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

While this representation is widely used to study biological function, it fails to capture the full structure of metabolic reactions, many of which involve more than two compounds. Hypergraphs offer a more natural representation, where nodes represent metabolites and hyperedges represent reactions involving multiple participants. Clustering such metabolic hypergraphs can reveal systematic differences among evolutionarily distinct organisms, providing insight into ecological constraints and evolutionary pressures. Methods: In this study, we investigate how different graphs and hypergraphs embedding methods influence their unsupervised clustering, with the goal of capturing taxonomy-based classes. We apply 14 distinct embedding strategies to a large-scale dataset of 8,467 metabolic hypergraphs. Each embedding was followed by hierarchical clustering using a fixed linkage method. To assess performance, we compared the resulting clusters against known taxonomic groupings. Results: Our findings show that the choice of hypergraph embedding has a significant effect on clustering outcomes. Among the tested methods, Bag of Hyperedges with Jaccard distance, Histogram Cosine Kernel, and a Hypergraph Auto-Encoder consistently performed best. We also advocate that the embedding method should be chosen based on the goal of the downstream task.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

These genes are upregulated under short day conditions and downregulated under chilling conditions. The aim of the current work is to test the hypothesis that the expression of DAM3 and DAM4 correlates negatively with vegetative growth during dormancy induction and breaking. The expression of DAM3 and DAM4 as well as plant morphology and physiology were analyzed during a period of endodormancy induction and breaking. Furthermore, to analyze whether there exists a correlation between DAM expression and chill requirement, DAM3 and DAM4 expression was compared between cultivars with different chill requirements. Lastly, the DAM1, DAM2, DAM3, and DAM4 expression of concurrently growing summer and winter leaves was compared at multiple stages of dormancy-breaking. DAM3 and DAM4 expression negatively correlated with leaf area and petiole length. We conclude that DAM3 and DAM4 expression patterns are consistent with that of regulators of endodormancy. DAM4 expression in particular correlates strongly with vegetative growth during endodormancy breaking. DAM3 or DAM4 expression were not found to correlate with the cultivar-specific chill requirements. We theorize that the chill requirement of strawberry cultivars is based on vegetative growth and does not affect DAM expression or endodormancy status.

M.; McAdam, S.", "abstract": "Background and Aims: Leaf senescence allows plants to reallocate nutrients from aging leaves, often storing them for future use. As chlorophyll breaks down, other pigments emerge, creating the vibrant colors of autumn. In many deciduous trees, senescence is followed by abscission the physical detachment of leaves at the abscission zone (AZ). Though closely linked, senescence and abscission are distinct; some plants senesce without abscising, while others abscise partially senesced leaves. Most research on these processes has focused on herbaceous and crop species, which do not naturally shed leaves. Methods: To better understand how leaf senescence and abscission occur in temperate deciduous trees, we developed a novel method to quantify AZ competency (AZC) we also measured gas exchange, chlorophyll content, water potential, and abscisic acid in four tree species representing deciduous, brevi-deciduous, and marcescent leaf habits. Key results: The two deciduous species showed contrasting patterns: one degraded chlorophyll and ceased photosynthesis before AZC developed; the other retained chlorophyll and continued photosynthesis until nearly all AZs became competent. The brevi-deciduous species lost most chlorophyll but developed AZs gradually over a longer period. The marcescent species fully senesced but did not develop AZC.

The dataset, originally presented by Kaznatcheev et al., includes conditions with and without the drug Alectinib and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). We compare combinations of growth models (logistic, Gompertz, von Bertalanffy) and drug efficacy terms (Norton-Simon, linear, ratio-dependent) to identify which best explains the observed dynamics. Our models incorporate density dependence, frequency-dependent competition, and drug response, enabling mechanistic interpretation of tumor cell interactions. The logistic model with ratio-dependent drug efficacy best fits monoculture data. Using growth parameters from monocultures, we infer inter-type competition coefficients in co-cultures. We find that growth rate and carrying capacity are stable across CAF conditions, while competition and drug efficacy parameters shift, altering interaction dynamics.

Here, we investigate the role of MrgD in the nigrostriatal pathway using proteomic approaches focused on post-translational modifications in MrgD-knockout (KO) mice. Integrated proteomic, phosphoproteomic, and N-glycoproteomic analyses revealed significant alterations in synaptic vesicle-associated proteins, pointing to impaired neurotransmission in the nigrostriatal system of KO mice.

Pharmacodynamic analyses showed that MrgD modulates synaptic exocytosis in an agonist-selective manner, being responsive to alamandine but not {beta}-alanine. Furthermore, behavioral analyses revealed increased locomotor activity and compulsive-like behavior in MrgD-deficient mice, without impairments in short- or long-term memory.

Methods The 0.1% Diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-Dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet was used to generate an immunobiliary DC- and {gamma}{delta}T-enriched mouse liver and LN single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas covering temporal disease dynamics, resolution and cDC2B depletion. cDC2 trajectories were inferred using VarID2 and {gamma}{delta}T cell transcription factor (TF) regulon activity was predicted by SCENIC. The human biliary niche was resolved by integrating human liver scRNA-seq data with available spatial transcriptomics data. Functional studies were conducted using Tcrd knockout, Il17a/f knockout and Tcrd reporter mice. Results A disease trajectory of Mgl2+ cDC2B was identified connecting DC maturation, homing and the expression of Il17- inducing genes. Disease progression was associated with numeric exhaustion of mature cDC2B and recruitment of DC precursors. {gamma}{delta}T cells were the main Il17 producers and were subtyped into Il17ahigh Scart1+ V{gamma}6+ and Il17low Scart2+ V{gamma}4+ populations exhibiting cDC2-directed communication and divergent TF regulon activity.

Understanding the context-dependence of reinforcing or degrading dynamics is pivotal to predicting stability of symbiotic benefits. Host phylogenetic relationships and host life history traits are two candidate axes that have been proposed to structure symbioses. However, the relative influence of host evolutionary history and life history on symbiont composition, and whether changes in symbiont composition translate into stronger mutualistic benefits is unknown. We tested the influence of plant phylogenetic relationships and plant life history on the composition of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, perhaps the most ancestral and influential of plant symbionts, and then tested whether AM fungal differentiation resulted in improved mutualism. We constructed mycobiomes composed of seven AM fungal isolates derived from tallgrass prairie and grew them for two growing seasons with 38 grassland plant species. We found that host phylogenetic structure was a significant predictor of the composition of AM fungal communities and the genetic composition of AM fungal species, patterns consistent with phylosymbiosis. However, the phylogenetic structure of AM fungi failed to translate to improved benefit to their host. While AM fungi generally improved plant growth and mycorrhizal feedback was generally positive, the strength of feedback was not predicted by plant phylogenetic distance. The composition of the AM fungal community and genetic composition within AM fungal species were also significantly influenced by plant life history. In addition, feedbacks between early and late successional species were generally positive. Interestingly, changes in species composition did not predict feedback, while changes in genetic composition of the two most abundant AM fungal species predicted positive mycorrhizal feedback. These reinforcing mycorrhizal feedbacks across life history can mediate plant species turnover during succession and suggests that consideration of mycorrhizal dynamics could improve restoration.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

However, coastal development and the growth of megacities along shorelines impose an array of stressors on the marine environment. These stressors inevitably impact biodiversity which dictates ecosystem functions and services. Despite extensive research on biodiversity responses to anthropogenic stressors, phylum-specific resistance and resilience dynamics - particularly in coastal marine ecosystems - remain poorly understood. Considering the global scale of coastal development, it is imperative to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how biodiversity, in terms of richness and community composition, is influenced by various anthropogenic stressors. Here, we present the first application of standardized Autonomous Reef Monitoring Structures (ARMS) as an experimental unit - using a common garden experimental design - to examine community responses to stress within an urbanized seascape. ARMS were seeded within two marine reserves for one year and then transplanted to sites of stress, including domestic sewage, and mariculture. We hypothesized that 1) human impacts reduce richness and alter composition of established communities; and 2) increasing intensity of these impacts reduces community resistance and resilience to stress. Using metabarcoding, we quantified richness and taxonomic composition and assessed their changes along an impact gradient. Our results showed that nutrient pollution, particularly inorganic nitrogen, significantly reduced species richness and restructured communities. Communities exhibited low resistance, yet high resilience - suggesting that urbanized seascapes have high recovery potential when stress is mitigated.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

The rapid transition to electric mobility, with projections of 40-45 million new electric vehicles (EVs) annually by 2030 (two in five new light-duty vehicles), promises quieter audible environments. However, a critical gap exists in our understanding of the acoustic trade-offs, especially of vehicle-generated ultrasound (frequencies >20 kHz). While ultrasound is known to be biologically potent, used for instance in wildlife repellents, its presence and potential impacts as an emission from traffic on sensitive species, such as bats, remain unaddressed. While the shift to EVs may reduce overall audible noise emissions, offering a green alternative, potential challenges for species with auditory systems tuned to ultrasound, and also actively using it via echolocation, could offset these benefits. This may set up a green-green dilemma, as the objective of decarbonising transport via e-mobility may undermine efforts to restore urban biodiversity. Our systematic review of 49 studies on anthropogenic/vehicular noise impacts on 114 bat species/species groups revealed that road noise, especially when overlapping with bat echolocation and communication frequencies, consistently elicited negative responses in playback experiments, whereas field observations were more variable. A meta-analysis from this dataset showed that the odds of bats being affected significantly increased with both noise intensity and frequency. Building on this evidence, this review explores the implications for a future dominated by EVs.

In the Florida Keys habitat suitability models incorporate coarse spatial data sampled over large areas, resulting in recommended outplant sites at distant locations, making it logistically difficult and expensive to access and regularly monitor. Restoration efforts to date show that outplanting success can vary widely within a limited space, necessitating improved predictive abilities of coral outplant success at high spatial resolutions within a restoration site. With the advent of Structure-from-Motion image reconstruction, fine-scale, site specific, digital terrain models can be created to support habitat suitability model development. In this study, generalized linear mixed models used extracted seafloor terrain attributes and environmental variables to identify within site locations of high Acropora cervicornis growth and healthy coral cover of long-term outplants. Percent healthy coral cover significantly decreased after two years of outplantation. The submodel of corals exclusively less than two years old was unable to identify environmental conditions associated with higher healthy cover. For all corals, outplant recommendations for higher healthy cover are in deeper waters, away from the coast, in less rough terrain, and closer to the reef edge. Model results for growth support these recommended outplant sites, in addition to concave locations near high slope relief. Finally, our results also indicate that marine heat waves, but especially marine cold waves negatively correspond with coral growth, and high wind events positively correspond with coral growth.

Furthermore, agricultural run-off means non-target, natural ecosystems are also affected. Resistance may arise both through mutations to target enzyme EPSPS in the shikimate pathway generating insensitivity to glyphosate and through non-target site mutations regulating the dose of glyphosate reaching the shikimate pathway. Either mechanism may trade-off against normal cell functioning. Here, using experimental evolution of replicated Chlamydomonas reinhardtii populations facing glyphosate, we reveal the metabolomic fingerprint of both glyphosate action and emerging resistance by applying untargeted metabolomic screens throughout the course of resistance evolution. Furthermore, this allows us to evaluate potential underlying molecular mechanisms and fitness costs. We find evidence of build-up of shikimate pathway metabolites, a characteristic signal of glyphosate action, that subsides but does not disappear as resistance evolves, suggesting a fitness trade-off. Concurrent with this is evidence of cell wide disruption of the amino acid pool, that stabilises as resistance evolves. We also found evidence of effects of glyphosate on membrane lipids and increased levels of reactive oxygen species persisting after resistance had evolved. This suggests a considerable effect of the recently described secondary effect of glyphosate: oxidative damage.

Environmental effect on yield related to sowing season and locality was detected, with an overall higher yield in autumn compared to spring sowing trials and in central rather than southern Italy. By dissecting the GEI structure using additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) analysis and Weighted Average of Absolute Scores (WAASB) index, we identified a group of Iranian landraces (PI 431633 AGL and PI 432033 LSP AGL) adapted to both autumn and spring sowing and one Ethiopian landrace (IG 1959 AGL) showing high yield stability across all environmental conditions. These findings provide a foundation to unlock the full potential of lentil cultivation in European and Mediterranean systems by identifying adapted, high-performing genotypes.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

It constitutes an economic burden and presents a public health challenge alongside other Plasmodium species. Here, we present a part of global transcriptomic studies using custom designed microarrays, that compare the transcriptome of the parasite responsible for severe Plasmodium vivax manifestations, specifically hepatic dysfunction and cerebral malaria from India, with an emphasis on the pir genes, some of which are reported to play a role in cyto-adherence. 23 patients with Plasmodium vivax malaria (Uncomplicated=6, Hepatic dysfunction=12 and Cerebral malaria=5) were subjected to microarray hybridization and the data so obtained showed a wide range of pir subfamilies have been differentially expressed. Upregulation has been seen in 24 pir genes in cerebral malaria samples (n=5) and 28 genes in hepatic dysfunction samples (n=12) belonging to different subfamily in at least 50% of the patient samples. Out of the upregulated pir genes in cerebral malaria manifestation, members of vir subfamily E and pvpir H are maximum in number whereas in hepatic dysfunction manifestation, members of vir subfamily E and C comprise a significant proportion.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Given that inflammation is central to many acute and chronic diseases, understanding EV biodistribution under inflammatory conditions is essential for therapeutic optimization. This study examines how acute systemic inflammation influences EV biodistribution, clearance, and plasma half-life, with a focus on the role of macrophages and their polarization states. Using a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation model in wild-type mice and bioluminescent and fluorescent labelling of EVs, we observed that inflammation extends the plasma half-life of EVs by over 600-fold within 2 hours and 900-fold at 24 hours post-administration, leading to significant enrichment in inflamed organs, particularly the liver and spleen. Enhanced accumulation in specific tissues translated to increased targeting of immune- and epithelial cells within those organs, with notable uptake by hepatocytes in the liver. This prolonged half-life was attributed to the altered EV protein corona in inflamed tissues, which facilitates cellular association. These findings underscore the complex dynamics between EVs and immune cells under inflammatory conditions and provide critical insights for advancing EV-based therapies in chronic inflammatory diseases.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

While the tumor microenvironment (TME) - particularly cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)- plays a crucial role in supporting tumor growth, its metabolic contribution remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a critical role for type 2 deiodinase (D2), the enzyme that activates the thyroid hormone (TH) thyroxine (T4) into the biologically active triiodothyronine (T3), in sustaining a pro-tumorigenic TME in PDTC and ATC. We show that D2 is expressed not only in thyroid epithelial cancer cells, but at even higher levels in CAFs, especially inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs). In in vivo mouse models, pharmacological inhibition of D2 reduces tumor growth and alters composition of CAFs. In 3D co-culture spheroids, D2 activity proves essential for supporting tumor cell proliferation by establishing a paracrine loop between stromal and epithelial cancer cells that amplifies local TH signaling. Notably, human PDTC organoids expressing D2 respond to modulation of TH levels, confirming the functional relevance of this metabolic axis in human tumors. In conclusion, these findings identify D2 as a key mediator of stromal-epithelial crosstalk in PDTC and ATC, and highlight local TH metabolism as a potential therapeutic target in these lethal cancers.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Transported nucleotide-sugars serve as donors in post-translational modification of proteins/ lipids, and donate sugar moiety to the growing carbohydrate chain on the nascent protein/lipid molecule, a reaction catalysed by the enzyme glycosyltransferase. Here we reported that a mutation in the Arabidopsis thaliana gene At3g11320 coding for NST protein causes defects in male gametophyte development, including collapsed, nonviable pollen. This mutation also caused impairment in the female gametophyte progression by arresting it at the functional megaspore (FM) stage. Further, the mutant phenotype, including silique size and seed set, was reverted when the cDNA of the AtNST gene was over-expressed in the mutant background. No abortive ovules were found in the siliques from the complemented plants. The results suggest that AtNST (At3g11320) gene might be responsible for maintaining and regulating transport of nucleotide-sugars from cytoplasm to the Golgi lumen for the glycosylation of essential proteins/carbohydrates/lipids etc., which are necessary for both male and female gametophyte development stages.

The present study examined the role of novel reactivity phenotype on locomotor responses to repeated cocaine exposure during adolescence and adulthood in male rats. Prior to drug exposure, reactivity to a novel object was measured and animals were separated into low responders (LR) and high responders (HR). Cocaine was administered daily (0 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) for 12 consecutive days, and behavior recorded on days 1, 6, and 12. After 28 days without drug, rats were challenged with cocaine (20 mg/kg) and behavior was assessed. Novel reactivity phenotype had a dramatic role in adolescents acute responsiveness to cocaine. HR adolescents exhibited a robust increase in sensitivity to acute administration of 20 mg/kg cocaine. However, following repeated cocaine exposure, both LR and HR adults displayed a marked increase in cocaine-induced locomotor activity, whereas the change in behavioral responsiveness in LR and HR adolescents was not as dramatic. During the cocaine challenge trial, LR that were exposed to 20 mg/kg cocaine during adolescence showed the highest cocaine-induced responsiveness compared to their saline-exposed and adult-exposed counterparts. Overall, these data indicate that novel reactivity phenotype and age of initial cocaine exposure are intricately involved in the long-term behavioral effects of cocaine. Thus, novel reactivity phenotype may predispose cocaine-using adolescents to continue drug-seeking behavior and potential abuse.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

To maintain photosynthetic efficiency, benthic diatoms have developed protective strategies, including the mobilization of antioxidant xanthophyll cycle and the ability for vertical migration through the sediment. However, the cellular signaling pathways underlying migration remain poorly characterized. This study investigated the triggering effect of reactive oxygen species on behavioral and photophysiological responses, through the analysis of lipophilic pigments and fluorescence parameters. To this end, two microphytobenthic communities, one with sediment allowing vertical migration and another without sediment restricting it, were exposed to irradiance, cold atmospheric plasma, and hydrogen peroxide stresses. Results showed a consistent downward migration response under all oxidative stresses, highlighting the key role of reactive oxygen species, especially hydrogen peroxide, in triggering and driving this microphytobenthic behavior. Moreover, a difference was observed between the pathways involved in vertical migration and those underlying the photophysiological response. Hydrogen peroxide and cold atmospheric plasma stresses highlighted the necessity of substantial microphytobenthic migration, whereas irradiance induced a specific and controlled response involving engagement of the xanthophyll cycles, acting in synergy with the migration strategy by showing stronger activation when migration was impaired. By establishing that the rapid and efficient migration strategy, acting in synergy with xanthophyll cycles in epipelic cells, is induced by reactive oxygen species, this study provides key insights into the molecular basis of microphytobenthic responses to cellular and environmental oxidative stress.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

When we analysed the genome sequences of two clinical E. faecium strains isolated in Birmingham, UK, we found two pRUM-like plasmids, pHHEf1 and pHHEf2. They were approximately 25 kb in size and shared the same 10 kb backbone, but contained starkly different accessory regions that were bounded by and interspersed with the IS26 family insertion sequence IS1216. pHHEf1 contained a complete set of vancomycin resistance genes, while pHHEf2 contained aminoglycoside and erythromycin resistance genes along with an integrated small plasmid, pCOLA. It appeared that IS1216 had driven the diversification of these accessory regions. We sought to characterise the role of IS1216 in the broader evolution of pRUM-like plasmids by performing comparative analyses on 152 complete plasmid sequences from five continents. Extensive IS1216-mediated variation included backbone deletions, acquisition and loss of 10 different antibiotic resistance genes, and the formation of cointegrates with plasmids of at least 10 different replicon types. Cointegration events have introduced accessory segments with diverse functions, including horizontal transfer determinants and genes for bacteriocin T8. The derivations of these acquired segments highlight the impact of IS1216 in driving gene exchange between Enterococcus and Staphylococcus species. We traced the emergence of the pRUM-like lineage to a putative ancestor found in a vancomycin-sensitive ST17 E. faecium isolated in 1997. The ancestral plasmid, pCANE, includes the entire pRUM backbone with an additional 44.9 kb in place of the pRUM accessory region. The 44.9 kb segment includes putative conjugation determinants, suggesting that the emergence of the pRUM-like lineage coincided with a loss of transfer functions. We propose an IS1216 driven model for the evolution of pRUM-like plasmids, which appear to have arisen in E. faecium ST17 and contributed to the international success of CC17 as an opportunistic pathogen.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Despite its biological and pathological relevance, studies on the full-length protein remain limited due to its intrinsically disordered, low-complexity domain, which renders hnRNPA2B1 highly aggregation-prone and difficult to purify. In this study, we report the successful expression and purification of full-length hnRNPA2B1 with high purity and minimal nucleic acid contamination. By optimizing buffer conditions, specifically ionic strength and pH, we maintain the protein in solution following cleavage of its solubility tag. Preliminary in vitro characterization under near-physiological conditions reveals that purified hnRNPA2B1 undergoes LLPS, forming dynamic liquid-like droplets that grow and mature into amorphous aggregates. Our approach provides a robust method for purifying hnRNPA2B1 suitable for LLPS and aggregation studies.

This negativity is posed to be enhanced when expecting highly emotional stimuli; however, the specific role attention plays in its generation is unclear, as emotional content is more salient and arousing, and thus recruits higher attentional resources. Here, affective anticipation signals were recorded in 35 participants with EEG, and their brain sources elucidated using multiple sparse priors algorithm. Using a cued-paradigm, the category of a sound being negatively valenced or neutral could be predicted with a 68% accuracy. To shift attentional resources away from the emotional content, participants were instructed to listen and respond to a burst of white noise that occurred on 9% of trials. Results showed slower reaction times following the aversive cue, yet no difference in EEG amplitude between aversive and neutral anticipation. Response times positively correlated with EEG amplitude - participants with stronger negativity were faster to respond. EEG source reconstruction demonstrated no differences between conditions, and showed activation of areas within the salience network including insula, somatosensory cortex, and thalamus. The current results suggest that anticipatory EEG negativity is an index of attentional resource-allocation during the anticipation period and does not reflect the emotional content of upcoming stimuli.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we capitalised on a recent hierarchical classification method, which uses multivariate decoding to index how well human observers sustain their attention within a dynamic visual environment. We asked whether this method could be used to anticipate behavioural errors based on neural activity measured with electroencephalography (EEG). We first decoded patterns of EEG activity that systematically correlated with critical aspects of a Multiple Object Monitoring (MOM) task. The extent to which we could decode this information depended on whether a stimulus was relevant for behaviour, which was lower before participants failed to detect (or \"missed\") target stimuli, presumably due to attentional lapses. Here, we exploited this drop in neural decodability to predict whether errors were about to occur on each trial.

Our example is data on abundances of nymphal Amblyomma americanum from nine locations spread across the eastern United States, collected by NEON. The data exhibit highly variable sampling regimes and abundance levels across sites and time. We implement two versions of GPs to forecast tick abundance and benchmark them models against LR approaches. Both GPs are able to capture population patterns without the need for forecasting additional drivers, such as temperature, or specifying a specific relationship between the response and predictors.

Incubated cocaine-craving is mediated, at least in part, by increased glutamate release within the prelimbic cortex (PL) . We hypothesized that this glutamate release stimulates NMDA-type glutamate receptors (NMDARs) leading to calcium-dependent activation of CaMKII signaling that drives incubated craving. To test this hypothesis, adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer either IV cocaine or sucrose pellets (6h/day x10 days) and tested for cue-elicited cocaine- or sucrose-craving in early versus later (i.e. after incubation) withdrawal. Incubated cocaine-seeking was associated with increased CaMKII activity in the PL, but no change in NMDAR subunits. In contrast, incubated sucrose-craving was associated with many sex-dependent changes in both NMDAR subunit expression and CaMKII activation that were subregion-selective. An intra-PL infusion of the NMDA antagonist D-AP5 (2.5 or 7.5 {micro}/side) or the CaMKII inhibitor myr-AIP (10 pg/side) blocked both incubated cocaine- and sucrose-craving, with no effects detected in early withdrawal. Co-infusion of both D-AP5 and myr-AIP exerted an additive effect on incubated cocaine-craving that was larger than either antagonist alone. These data corroborate earlier evidence for distinct biochemical correlates within mPFC between incubated cocaine- and sucrose-craving and, for the first time, demonstrate that NMDARs and CaMKII activation within the PL are common drivers of incubated craving that operate via independent signaling pathways suggesting combined pharmacological treatments may have greater efficacy in managing addiction.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

There is an incomplete understanding of the cellular pathways co-opted by flaviviruses, and differences in host response to infection may underlie the diverse pathologies caused. We present a single-cell approach (Quantification of Infection and CRISPR guide sequencing; QIC-seq) that combines CRISPR/Cas9 knockout with virus-inclusive transcriptomics to systematically compare host factor requirements and host transcriptional response to flaviviral challenge. We show that dengue and yellow fever viruses are strictly dependent on subunits of the oligosaccharyltransferase complex, while the more distantly related West Nile and Langat viruses are dependent on components of the ER-associated degradation machinery. Our data further shows virus-induced upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, and activation of the unfolded protein response. Together, QIC-seq enables quantitative comparisons of viral host factor utilization, which may inform development of host-directed antiviral therapies.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

SCFAs have shown both pro- and anti-viral roles among different viruses, and are known to regulate immune functions during infections. However, their role against the Zika virus (ZIKV) has never been investigated. In the present study, we aimed to examine the role of three SCFA derivatives: phenylbutyrate (PBA), sodium butyrate (NaB), and sodium acetate (NaAC), on ZIKV replication and associated ocular complications using primary human trabecular meshwork cells (HTMCs) and an IFNAR1-deficient mouse model of ocular infection. Our findings reveal that PBA and NaAc treatment dramatically suppressed the ZIKV replication in HTMCs. PBA and NaAc treatment significantly attenuated the ZIKV-induced inflammatory cytokine, interferons, and interferon-stimulated genes response via antagonizing the RIG-I/NF{kappa}B/MAPKs/STAT1-3 signaling pathways. We discovered that ZIKV induces the expression of free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2) in HTMCs, which is further potentiated by PBA/NaAc. Pharmacological inhibition of FFAR2 abrogated the protective abilities of PBA/NaAc and significantly increased viral replication. Blocking FFAR2 receptors promoted ZIKV-induced cell death, which was suppressed by PBA and NaAc. Mechanistically, butyrate and acetate inhibited ZIKV binding and cellular entry and inactivated the virus before internalization. PBA and NaAc treatment in mice attenuated the ZIKV-induced ocular manifestations, which were abrogated by FFAR2 inhibition. Collectively, our findings indicate that SCFA treatment is an effective approach to limit ZIKV replication and associated ocular damage and may be worth exploring as a means to treat or prevent ZIKV-induced ocular complications in humans.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Recombinant IAV expressing fluorescent proteins have allowed monitoring viral infection in cultured cells and ex vivo in the organs of infected animals. However, fluorescent-expressing IAV are often attenuated and are not suited for the imaging of infected animals using in vivo imaging systems (IVIS). To overcome this limitation, we generated a recombinant A/California/04/2009 H1N1 (pH1N1) expressing nanoluciferase (Nluc) from the non-structural (NS) viral segment (pH1N1-Nluc) that replicates efficiently in vitro, with growth kinetics and plaque morphology comparable to wild-type pH1N1 (pH1N1-WT). We used this pH1N1-Nluc to demonstrate its ability to identify neutralizing antibodies and antivirals, with neutralization and inhibition results comparable to pH1N1-WT. In mice, pH1N1-Nluc was able to induce similar body weight loss and mortality, and viral titers comparable to pH1N1-WT, results that were recapitulated in a ferret model of IAV infection. Using IVIS, pH1N1-Nluc enabled non-invasive, real-time tracking of viral infection in vivo and ex vivo following infection of mice with viral titers comparable to pH1N1-WT. The flexibility of this approach was further demonstrated by the generation of a Nluc-expressing recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8-Nluc).

Loss of its enzymatic activity occurs in some cancers, including renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In RCC, SETD2 mutations have been linked to delayed transcription termination, but not explored in depth. Here, using nascent transcriptomics in SETD2 knockout and patient-derived cells, we reveal a dichotomy in SETD2 functions depending on the affected protein-coding gene. Majority of genes, named class I, are dependent on SETD2 function for transcription initiation, yet terminate transcription in the usual locations. In contrast, for class II genes, corresponding to 15-25% of active protein-coding genes, transcription initiation is robust in absence of SETD2 activity, however widespread transcriptional readthrough occurs. Defective termination following SETD2 loss/mutation is associated with increased cryptic transcription initiation and impaired 3' pre-mRNA cleavage. Additionally, alternative polyadenylation upon SETD2 activity loss is highly cell type specific, and unrelated to transcription readthrough. In summary, we demonstrate that methyltransferase activity of SETD2 regulates transcriptional integrity by stimulating proper initiation, preventing cryptic initiation and promoting efficient 3' end processing.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

However, how tRNAPro is annealed to the primer binding site (PBS), which is embedded in a highly structured hairpin in the genomic RNA (gRNA), remains unclear. We hypothesize that HTLV-1 Gag may have more robust chaperone activity than mature HTLV-1 nucleocapsid (NC), which in contrast to HIV-1 NC, displays relatively weak chaperone function, and that a cellular co-factor may be required to facilitate primer tRNA annealing. Recombinant HTLV-1 Gag was successfully purified for the first time and used to perform primer-annealing assays. Relative to mature NC and matrix (MA) domains, HTLV-1 Gag is only slightly more effective at chaperoning the annealing of tRNAPro to the PBS. To identify potential HTLV-1 Gag interacting co-chaperones of tRNA annealing in cells, we performed affinity tagging/purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS). Two significant AP-MS hits, RPL7 and DDX21, were further validated by reciprocal co-IP studies in both HEK293T and chronically HTLV-1-infected MT-2 cells. Domain mapping studies revealed that HTLV-1 Gag interacts with RPL7 and DDX21 through the zinc fingers in the NC domain independent of the presence of RNA. In addition, we showed that both RPL7 and DDX21 are packaged into virions. RPL7 or DDX21 alone was more effective than HTLV-1 Gag at annealing tRNAPro to the PBS. Synergistic effects of the Gag/RPL7/DDX21 combination in facilitating tRNAPro annealing to the PBS were found.

In this study, we explored the potential conservation of a bacterial purinosome-like complex in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen known for its high antibiotic resistance. Using a bacterial two-hybrid system, we mapped protein-protein interactions among all tested DNPNB enzymes in P. aeruginosa and revealed a dense interaction network. An in-silico protein-protein docking approach on three core enzymes allowed the structural reconstitution of a complex composed of PurK, PurE and PurC with a 4:8:8 stoichiometry, respectively.

In humans, the cytosolic (hMDH1) and mitochondrial (hMDH2) isoforms operate in distinct compartments, suggesting potential differences in regulation. Here, we present a comparative analysis of hMDH1 and hMDH2 under physiologically relevant conditions, integrating enzymatic assays, ligand binding studies, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and molecular modeling. Our findings reveal that hMDH2 activity is inhibited by -ketoglutarate, glutamate, NAD, ATP, and citrate at concentrations consistent with mitochondrial metabolic states characterized by elevated amino acid catabolism or redox stress. Conversely, hMDH1 exhibits minimal impact by these metabolites, with only modest inhibition observed in the presence of ATP and ADP. SAXS analyses confirm that both isoforms maintain stable dimeric structures upon ligand binding, indicating that regulation is not mediated by global conformational changes. Structural modeling and normal mode analyses identify increased flexibility in hMDH1, particularly within the active site loop, thumb loop, and a partially disordered C-terminal helix. In contrast, hMDH2 displays a more rigid architecture and a more electropositive active site environment, correlating with its heightened sensitivity to anionic metabolites. Fluorescence quenching experiments further support these distinctions, demonstrating stronger binding affinities for nucleotide-based ligands in hMDH2 compared to hMDH1. Collectively, these results suggest that isoform-specific regulation of human MDH arises from differences in local structural dynamics and electrostatics, rather than large-scale structural rearrangements. hMDH2 appears adapted to integrate mitochondrial metabolic signals, modulating malate oxidation in response to cellular conditions, while hMDH1 maintains consistent cytosolic function across diverse metabolic states.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

We generated ~40,000 sequence-phenotype pairs, enabling us to profile the activities of ~6,500 unique DAOx variants against five D-amino acid substrates with distinct physicochemical properties. Our analysis revealed that substrate-specific mutations are distributed throughout the enzyme structure. Mutations near the active site drive strong specificity shifts but also incur catalytic penalties, while distal mutations subtly rewire intramolecular contacts in order to modulate specificity with minimal loss of activity. We identified and validated positional hotspots that act allosterically to influence specificity, and characterized key variants that acquired exclusive substrate specificity or exhibited up to 230-fold changes in substrate preference. Combining mutations with complementary effects further sharpened substrate discrimination, enabling rational design of highly selective biocatalysts.

We employed a consensus-based computational framework on the C. trachomatis D/UW-3/CX proteome and identified 17 OMBB proteins, including well-known Pmp family members and MOMP. Eight OMBB proteins were computationally characterized, which showed significant structural homology with known outer membrane proteins from other bacteria. Sequence-based annotation tools were used to determine their putative functions. B-cell and T-cell epitopes were predicted from the selected proteins.

Several studies have also revealed that TrIP is rapidly downregulated following T cell activation and can play important roles in T cell differentiation. Methods: We generated mice with CD8-specific TrIP deficiency. We then implanted these mice, and Cre-only control animals, with B16 melanoma or MC38 colon carcinoma tumors. Tumor growth and anti-tumor immunity were then followed. We also assessed the effects of TrIP deficiency on transcriptional programs in CD8 T cells stimulated in vivo or derived from tumor-bearing mice. Results: We found that activated TrIP KO CD8 T cells display an increased inflammatory transcriptional profile in the absence of TrIP. Consistent with these effects, we also found that knockout of TrIP specifically in CD8 T cells resulted in reduced growth of syngeneic tumors. When characterizing the tumor-infiltrating cells, TrIP KO led to an increase in the number of tumor-infiltrating T cells, as well as a delay in the acquisition of an exhausted phenotype, based on phenotypic and transcriptomic analyses. Finally, our data suggest that TrIP regulates the diversity of T cell clonal responses to tumors, since we observed an increase in the number of distinct T cell clonotypes responding to a tumor neoantigen. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings demonstrate that TrIP intrinsically restricts the CD8 T cell response to tumors, and that targeting TrIP may augment the anti-tumor response in a way that is distinct from established checkpoint therapies.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

To confront this obstacle, we compared the dissociative effects of two commonly used detergents, Tween20 and Tween80, on particle-associated marine microbial communities. The ability of Tween treatments to liberate cells from particles, and to maintain cell integrity, was quantified by flow cytometry from multiple communities across seasons and locations. Both Tween20 and Tween80, at 185 RPM shaking, gently dissociated microbes from their particles, causing very little cell mortality. Additionally, Tween80 liberated a greater number of particle-associated cells into the free-living fraction. We also analyzed the effects of Tween treatments on the microbial community composition for one of these collections via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of the particle-associated and free-living fractions relative to unamended controls. Tween20 and Tween80 were both effective for microbial dissolution from particles, however Tween80 treatments displayed greater uniformity in the dissociated communities and significantly enriched for the most abundant particle-associated members. Together these data indicate that Tween80 was most effective at gently dissociating particle-associated cells.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

C.; David, S.; Beis, K.; Frankel, G.", "abstract": "During conjugation, plasmid DNA is transferred from donor to recipient bacteria via the plasmid-encoded mating pilus, built as thin helical assemblies of polymerised pilin subunits. The structure of the IncHI1 R27 plasmid encoded pilus revealed that the mature ThrA pilin is cyclized by a peptide bond formed between Gly1 (G1) and Asp69 (D69). Loss of cyclization abolished pilus biogenesis and conjugation. Here we report that G1 and D69 are completely conserved in all TrhA pilins in the Plascad database. Substituting D69 with N, A, G or R showed that cyclization is a promiscuous process as all mutants cyclised and polymerised into pili. However, the D69R substitution specifically altered the electrostatic potential of the pilus surface, resulting in very low conjugation efficiency. Moreover, conjugation efficiency of the other substitutions into Escherichia coli MG1655, Enteropathogenic E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter rodentium and Citrobacter amalonaticus showed a consistent trend towards correlation with the side chain size: TrhA D69N > D69A > D69G. These results suggest that while cyclisation is promiscuous, there is a strong selective pressure to maintain D as the carboxy terminal residue for TrhA cyclisation.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

The NS1 protein is a multifunctional glycoprotein, highly conserved among Orthoflaviviruses, that is secreted from infected cells, circulate in the sera of dengue patients at high concentrations and has been involved with pathogenesis by several mechanisms, including vascular leakage and immune evasion. However, the role of NS1 within the mosquito vector is not fully understood. In this study, we observed that feeding female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with blood meals supplemented with recombinant NS1 resulted in increased midgut permeability, as evaluated by the diffusion of the non-toxic dye Brilliant Blue FCF into the hemocoel. Histological and transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed epithelial damage and disruption of the midgut cellular junctions. Immunofluorescence assays further demonstrated the delocalization of septate junction proteins essential for epithelial integrity. In addition, metalloproteinase expression in the midgut was also reduced. All these effects were abolished when NS1 was heat-inactivated indicating that they were NS1-dependent. Significantly, virus blood meals containing NS1 resulted in enhanced dissemination of DENV to secondary organs and earlier virus presence in the mosquito salivary glands, in comparison with meals treated with specific NS1 antibodies. Our findings reveal a novel function for NS1 in mosquitoes, and expand the understanding of NS1 functions beyond its human pathophysiological role. In addition, highlight NS1 as a strategic intervention point to reduce transmission efficiency in mosquitoes.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae are the two most common causes of healthcare-associated GNBSI, which may arise from gastrointestinal tract (GIT) colonisation. Understanding genomic and phenotypic adaptations that underpin transition from GIT colonisation to invasive bloodstream infection could improve understanding of pathogenesis. This study identified linked faecal and blood isolates from children with healthcare-associated GNBSI caused by E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Linked pairs were compared for antimicrobial resistance, biofilm formation, and underwent comparative genomic analysis via whole-genome sequencing, comparative average nucleotide identity (ANI) and core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Five isolate pairs (three E. coli, two K. pneumoniae) showed high relatedness, supporting GIT origin of bloodstream infection. Isolates within pairs had identical virulence genes whereas phenotypic assays revealed changes in antimicrobial susceptibility, with one pair undergoing changes in resistance gene profiles, and increased biofilm formation in 4/5 isolates. This study provides insight into within-host evolution from gastrointestinal colonisation to bloodstream invasion in Gram-negative pathogens. Convergence on metabolic adaptation and biofilm formation suggests these traits may be advantageous in healthcare-associated GNBSI. Further studies involving larger cohorts alongside functional validation of mutations are needed to better understand GNBSI pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

C.; Kars, G.; Scacchetti, A.; Sparr, A. C.; Schauer, T.; Imhof, A.; Becker, P. B.", "abstract": "The acetyltransferase KAT5/Tip60 is an epigenetic regulator of transcription and the DNA damage response. In Drosophila, Tip60 acetylates histones as part of the DOM-A complex, but it is unclear whether it has other substrates. In this work, we comprehensively studied the functions of Tip60 in a Drosophila proliferative cell model. Depletion of Tip60 arrests the cell cycle, but remaining viable cells resist mutagenic irradiation. The impaired proliferation is explained by reduced expression of critical cell cycle genes. Tip60 binds their transcription start sites and Tip60-dependent acetylation of the histone variant H2A.V correlates with transcription activity. A potentially synergistic pathway for cell cycle regulation involves the acetylation of proteins other than histones. The Tip60-dependent nuclear acetylome contains hundreds of proteins, many of which are involved in diverse aspects of cell growth and division, including replication, mitosis, gene expression, chromatin organization and ribosome biogenesis. We hypothesize that Tip60 coordinates the proliferative state through histone and non-histone effectors. Reversible acetylation of diverse effector proteins bears potential for fine-tuning energy-intensive processes in response to stresses or nutritional shortcomings. Our study portrays the DOM-A/TIP60 complex as a general promoter of cell proliferation.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

To overcome these limitations, we developed high ratio partial proteolysis with carrier proteome (HOLSER), an efficient workflow that combines high enzyme-to-substrate ratio with extended digestion time for low peptide yield variability and tandem mass tag (TMT)-based multiplexing that includes full digests for enhanced proteome depth and sequence coverage as well as precision of abundance measurements. We demonstrate HOLSER capabilities across diverse usage cases, including global proteome structure profiling, proof-of-principle methotrexate target elucidation, kinase target mapping with staurosporine, and high-resolution analysis of the FKBP-mTOR complex response to rapamycin.

Despite its importance, there are few tools to study E/I balance non-invasively in humans. Here, we propose a canonical microcircuit model to estimate E/I balance from non-invasive magneto- and electroencephalography (M/EEG) recordings by parameterising global pyramidal and inhibitory cell excitability. We first establish that E/I parameters are identifiable and recoverable. We then explore the effects of these new parameters and their interaction with other parameters in a series of simulations. To highlight the clinical relevance of this new model, we simulate changes in E/I balance and their impact on event-related potentials (ERPs) derived from paired-click, passive and active oddball paradigms, which are among the most robust clinical biomarkers of schizophrenia. Our simulations show that a loss of pyramidal cell excitability can explain reduced ERP amplitudes across all three paradigms, mirroring empirical findings in schizophrenia. This method may serve as a computational assay for estimating synaptopathy and E/I balance from non-invasive M/EEG recordings across various clinical conditions thereby advancing efforts to develop personalised interventions to restore E/I balance.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

D.; Sorokina, A.; Kasthuri, N.", "abstract": "The principles that govern where excitatory synapses form on cortical pyramidal neurons remain unclear. A long-standing hypothesis is that connectivity mirrors neuronal geometry with apical dendrites dominating in layer 1 and basal dendrites in deeper layers. Leveraging the MiCRONS cubic-millimetre serial electron-microscopy dataset [1,2], we mapped 4968 synapses onto reconstructed apical and basal arbors across layers 1-6 of mouse visual cortex. Contrary to a simple gradient model, synaptic targeting is overwhelmingly biased toward basal dendrites in layers 2/3 to 6, even where apical shafts are abundant. Layer 1 is the sole exception, exhibiting the expected apical bias. Basal predominance scales with local soma density and the relative arbor length available for contact, such that 66% (61101/92445) of all synapses land within 130 microns of the soma, placing most excitatory drive near the cell body. Axonal analysis revealed specificity beyond mere geometric opportunity: individual axon segments preferentially innervated either basal or apical compartments far more often than predicted by chance, indicating compartment-selective wiring rules. Together, our results show that cortical connectivity is shaped by both neuronal geometry and axon-level targeting preferences, redefining how pyramidal cells integrate information across layers and apical and basal dendrites.", "date": "2025-07-15", "journal": ""}

Here we determine the ability of in 6-7month-old TgF344-AD rats to learn reward predictive cues and to shift behavior away from reward-predictive cues following outcome devaluation while recording mPFC neurons. Specifically, AD rats (n=17) and wild-type littermates (n=17) were presented with two distinct cues as conditioned stimuli (CS+) predicting distinct outcomes. A conditioned taste aversion to one outcome was induced, after which the rats were tested post-devaluation to evaluate their ability to avoid the CS+ associated with the devalued outcome. We found a loss of motivated behavior during learning and a loss of flexible behavior during testing in 6-7-month-old AD rats relative to WT littermate controls. In addition, there was differential aberrant mPFC encoding of cue-outcome associations in AD rats during conditioning and following outcome devaluation. Specifically, AD animals show fewer neurons during conditioning that encode both the cue and the outcome than WT animals. Also, AD animals showed a greater proportion of neurons that exhibited an excited response to reward predictive cues following outcome devaluation.

Dolphins expressed escape behaviours exclusively near tourist boats and were more likely to transition into foraging near fishing nets (mostly purse-seines). Smaller groups reacted more strongly to tourist boats and interacted more frequently with fishing nets, especially in seasons when fish landing data showed a decline in their prey.

Defects in kinesin-1 activity have been implicated in various human neurological disorders and intracellular pathogens such as bacteria and viruses hijack its activity. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms governing kinesin-1 activation remains poorly understood. Here, we report an 8.0-[A] cryo-electron microscopy structure of the kinesin-1 heterotetramer composed of two kinesin heavy chains (KHC) and two light chains (KLC), in its autoinhibited conformation. Our structure reveals a complex 36-nm head-to-tail assembly in which self-folded dimeric KHCs are stabilized by asymmetrically arranged KLCs through a combination of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. This state inhibits kinesin motility by constraining the dimeric motor domains in a configuration that is incompatible with motility. Notably, our structure also shows that the dimeric KLC TPR cargo-binding domains are occluded, providing a structural basis for the autoinhibition of both motor activity and cargo binding. Functional studies along with structural modeling suggest that binding of known regulatory factors, such as MAP7D3, to the KHC coiled coils likely competes with intramolecular coiled-coil interactions, resulting in the unfurling of the autoinhibited structure and activation of motor activity.

While learning performance was comparable across groups, individuals with chronic pain relied more on recent reinforcement history and less on integrated value representations during decision-making. Computational modeling confirmed that a mixture model best captured behavior across groups, with the chronic pain group assigning significantly less weight to global expected values. The acute pain group showed an intermediate pattern, suggesting a potential transitional phenotype. This shift in valuation strategy was associated with the duration of pain rather than its intensity, suggesting that prolonged exposure to pain may gradually alter decision-making processes.
