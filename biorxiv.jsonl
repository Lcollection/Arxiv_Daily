There are a variety of well-established methods for uniquely marking individuals (e.g., visible implant elastomer, barcodes, paint). However, for some species, life history stages, and/or experiments, existing methods are not sufficient. Here, we describe procedures for how two tagging methods - a tattoo ink injection method and a fishing line piercing method - can be used with the youngest, smallest juveniles of the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, which are too small for the methods used with adults. With the tattoo method, we injected tattoo ink into the dorsal muscle. Different colors and injection locations can be used to distinguish among individuals over a period of weeks (up to 4 weeks, average 2.5-3 weeks under our conditions). Because fish this young and small are sensitive to handling and injection, we also include physiological data showing fish recover well from anesthetization and tagging. With the piercing method, very thin fishing line is threaded through the dorsal muscle and tied into a barbell or loop. Unique colors and patterns can be used to distinguish among individuals over a period of months. Because a physical tag might impede normal movement in a very small fish, we also include data from an open field exploration test showing similar behavior between tagged and control (non-tagged) juveniles. We expect these effective and inexpensive methods to be useful for a variety of small species and will facilitate early-life, developmental, and longitudinal research.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

We systemically searched the PubMed for the trend-analysis articles published in 10 leading medicine and oncology journals during the 11 years from 2008 to 2018. The studies published after 2019 were not included due to the sudden, significant increase of publication number during and immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic. Only original articles, research letters and meta-analyses/systematic reviews were included. We scored the reporting quality of these articles based on whether they reported p-values/effect-sizes, and beta/co-efficient/slope/ annual-percentage-change (APC). There were 297 qualified articles, among which 193 (66.0%) and 216 (72.7%) articles reported P-value and effect-size, respectively. Only 13 (5.8%) analyses reported neither p-value/effect size nor beta/coefficient/slope/APC. In multivariable regression models, author affiliation of epidemiology department was associated with less reporting effect-size, but that of statistics department with more reporting. Interestingly, U.S. senior-authors (versus non-U.S.) more likely reported p-values. No factors were independently linked to reporting APC. The reporting quality of trend analyses in leading medicine and oncology journals appear moderate and should be further improved.

The loss of developmental competency in vitro that is exacerbated during the generation of transgenic tachyzoites is also a major impediment to understanding the molecular basis of bradyzoite recrudescence, which is the central parasite stage of reactivation. We have successfully modified Toxoplasma genes in the bradyzoite tissue cyst stage using ex vivo bradyzoite-based methods. Our new protocols validated the clonality of individual cysts and confirmed that single tissue cysts can robustly infect mice. We demonstrated these protocols by generating in vivo bradyzoites carrying a knockout of the Toxoplasma HXGPRT gene or the gene encoding the ApiAP2 transcription factor, AP2IX-9. Unexpectedly, the knockout of the AP2IX-9 gene in the Type II ME49EW strain eliminated one of the three developmental pathways initiated by the bradyzoite: host-dependent bradyzoite-to-bradyzoite replication. Our genetic protocols were further validated by producing in vivo bradyzoites lacking the bradyzoite-specific cyclin, TgCYC5. Interestingly, genetic ablation of TgCYC5 led to a large number of small cysts that formed from single mother cysts in mouse brain. Further study revealed the cause of the small-cyst phenotype in TgCYC5 knockout parasites was a disruption in the normal balance of bradyzoite subtypes that enhanced the bradyzoite-to-bradyzoite developmental pathway. These new data demonstrate the feasibility of generating transgenic parasites in a developmentally competent strain using ex vivo bradyzoite-based methods. Furthermore, by targeting the AP2IX-9 and TgCYC5 genes, whose transcripts are upregulated specifically in bradyzoites, we have clarified how these factors influence the pathways of tissue cyst recrudescence.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Our previous study showed that MEIS1-FL localizes nuclei and promotes ATOH1 protein degradation through transcriptional regulation, thereby promoting GCP differentiation. In contrast, our in vivo electroporation experiment in this study shows that MEIS1-HdL inhibits GCP differentiation. MEIS1-HdL localizes in the cytoplasm and inhibits the degradation of ATOH1 mediated by CUL3, which is a newly identified E3 ligase for ATOH1.

However, current deep learning approaches are limited by incomplete observability and the lack of ground-truth labels in real experiments. Consequently, models are often trained on synthetic data, which leads to the well-known \"model mismatch\" problem when simulated dynamics diverge from true neural activity. To overcome these challenges, we present Deep Domain Adaptive Matching (DeepDAM), a training framework that adaptively matches synthetic and in vivo data domains for neural connectivity inference. Specifically, DeepDAM fine-tunes deep neural networks on a combined dataset of synthetic simulations and unlabeled in vivo recordings, aligning the model's feature representations with real neural dynamics to mitigate model mismatch. We demonstrate this approach in rodent hippocampal CA1 circuits as a proof of concept, achieving near perfect connectivity inference performance (Matthews correlation coefficient 0.97-1.0) and substantially surpassing classical methods (0.6-0.7). We further demonstrate robustness across multiple recording conditions within this hippocampal dataset. Additionally, to illustrate its broader applicability, we extend the framework to two distinct systems without altering the core methodology: a stomatogastric microcircuit in Cancer borealis (ex vivo) and single neuron intracellular recordings in mouse, where DeepDAM significantly improves efficiency and accuracy over standard approaches. By effectively leveraging synthetic data for in vivo and ex vivo analysis, DeepDAM offers a generalizable strategy for overcoming model mismatch and represents a critical step towards data-driven reconstruction of functional neural circuits.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we expand the analysis to fifteen tissues, comprising 8,772 samples from two independent datasets. Unlike healthy phenotypes, cancer GCNs show that the strongest gene-pair interactions are intra-chromosomal, with their strength decaying as base-pair distance increases. Tumor GCN communities are strongly associated with cancer-related processes and are enriched in gene families located on the same chromosome. In contrast, normal GCN communities are linked to metabolic and cell maintenance processes. Riboproteins remain highly co-expressed in both cancer and normal GCNs, highlighting their importance for cell viability. Notably, in other chronic diseases, such as Type-2 Diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, the loss of long-range co-expression is absent, suggesting it is a distinctive feature of cancer.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

We derive analytical conditions for these regimes using deterministic replicator dynamics and validate them in stochastic Wright-Fisher models with mutation and drift. Applying our model to published microbial and cancer co-culture data, we show that real systems span both intrinsic-dominant and ecology-dominant regimes, with ecological effects sometimes reversing or neutralizing intrinsic fitness advantages.

A growing body of work suggests that the oligomeric scaffold PAR-3 can form unipolar asymmetries without mutual antagonism, but how it does so is largely unknown.

First, the intrinsic dynamics of PAR-3 membrane binding and oligomerization encode negative feedback on PAR-3 dissociation. Second, membrane-bound PAR-3 promotes its own recruitment through a mechanism that requires the anterior polarity proteins PAR-6 and PKC-3. Using a kinetic model tightly constrained by our experimental measurements, we show that these two feedback loops are individually required and jointly sufficient to encode dynamically stable and locally inducible unipolar PAR-3 asymmetries in the absence of posterior inhibition. Given the central role of PAR-3, and the conservation of PAR-3 membrane-binding, oligomerization, and core interactions with PAR-6/PKC-3, these results have widespread implications for PAR-mediated polarity in metazoa.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

The DSB number, distribution and timing of formation are regulated during meiosis to ensure crossing over on all chromosomes and prevent genome instability. In S. cerevisiae, DSB interference suppresses the coincident formation of DSBs in neighboring hotspots through a Tel1/ATM dependent mechanism that remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that Tel1 is recruited to meiotic DSB hotspots and chromosomal axis sites in a DSB-dependent manner. This supports the tethered loop-axis complex (TLAC) model that postulates meiotic DSBs are formed within the chromosome axis environment. Tel1 recruitment to meiotic DSBs, DSB interference and the meiotic DNA damage checkpoint are all dependent on the C-terminal moiety of Xrs2, known to mediate Tel1-Xrs2 interaction in vegetative cells. However, mutation of the Xrs2 FxF/Y motif, known to stabilize Tel1 interaction with Xrs2, does not affect DSBs interference but abolishes the Tel1-dependent DNA damage checkpoint.

To bridge this gap, we developed a deep learning-based computational pipeline that uses two-photon fluorescence microscopy images of cerebral microcirculation to enable automated reconstruction and quantification of the geometric changes across the microvascular network, comprising hundreds of interconnected blood vessels, pre and post-activation of the neighbouring neurons. The pipeline's utility was demonstrated in the Thy1-ChR2 optogenetic mouse model, where we observed network-wide vessel radius changes to depend on the photostimulation intensity, with both dilations and constrictions occurring across the cortical depth, at an average of 16.1{+/-}14.3 m (mean{+/-}stddev) away from the most proximal neuron for dilations; and at 21.9{+/-}14.6 m away for constrictions. We observed a significant heterogeneity of the vascular radius changes within vessels, with radius adjustment varying by an average of 24 {+/-} 28% of the resting diameter, likely reflecting the heterogeneity of the distribution of contractile cells on the vessel walls.

However, populations in nature rarely adapt to a single stress at a time. Instead, various biotic and abiotic factors come together to produce complex selective environments. Here, we used experimental evolution to describe adaptive dynamics in the presence of simultaneous stressors, and to quantify the evolution of trade-offs between stressors in a complex environment. We adapted populations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a full-factorial combination of four stressors over the course of 15 serial transfers. Rapid fitness increases were accompanied by the accumulation of mutations in genes and pathways related to specific stressors. Trade-offs evolved rapidly, with the order and mode of trade-off evolution varying between environments due to the inherent physiological and genetic basis of resistance to each stressor. Compensatory evolution for maladaptation as a result of initial trade-offs was typically mediated by fine-tuning of genes associated with the initially adapted environmental component, rather than those associated with the maladapted trait. As environmental complexity increased, mutations had increasingly broader effects across multiple biological processes. Although shared mutations at the individual SNP level were rare, recurrent mutations affecting the same genes and putative biological processes were abundant across environmental complexity.

In the auditory cortex (AC) repeated presentations of the same sound activate differing ensembles indicating high trial-by trial variability in activity even though the sounds activate the same percept. Efficient processing of complex acoustic signals requires that these sparsely distributed neuronal ensembles actively interact in order to provide a constant percept. Thus, the differing ensembles might interact to process the incoming sound inputs. Here, we probe interactions within and across ensembles by combining in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging and holographic optogenetic stimulation to study how increased activity of single cells level affects the cortical network. We stimulated a small number of neurons sharing the same frequency preference alongside the presentation of a target pure tone, further increasing their tone-evoked activity. We found that other non-stimulated co-tuned neurons decreased their tone-evoked activity when the frequency of the presented pure tone matched to their tuning property, while non co-tuned neurons were unaffected. Activity decrease was greater for non-stimulated co-tuned neurons with higher frequency selectivity. Co-tuned and non co-tuned neurons were spatially intermingled. Our results shows that co-tuned ensembles communicated and balanced their total activity across the larger network. The rebalanced network activity due to external stimulation remained constant. These effects suggest that co-tuned ensembles in AC interact and rapidly rebalance their activity to maintain encoding network dynamics, and that the rebalanced network is persistent.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

The mice engaged spontaneously with the task and learned to solve it within just a few trials. To dissect different contributions to this rapid form of learning, we combined deep learning-based behavioral tracking in a multi-camera setup with probabilistic inference and computational modeling. We find that the learning progress of the mice was initially dominated by the acquisition of motor skills, i.e., the increased ability to manipulate the individual mechanisms, while a cognitive strategy for the task sequence emerged only later.

A.; Tada, S.; Bessho, Y.; Ishida, Y.; Matsuda, E.", "abstract": "The X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a key suppressor of apoptosis, crucial for cellular differentiation, embryogenesis, and cancer progression. However, its upstream regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the zinc finger transcription factor Zbtb38, a negative regulator of apoptosis, modulates XIAP expression in both loss- and gain-of-function experiments, irrespective of p53 expression. Notably, XIAP overexpression rescues the apoptosis induced by Zbtb38 knockdown, indicating that Zbtb38-associated apoptosis is at least partially XIAP-dependent. Mechanistically, Zbtb38 binds to E-box motifs within upstream regulatory regions of XIAP and activates its transcription. During embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation and embryogenesis, Zbtb38 depletion increases apoptosis and reduces XIAP and Bcl-2 expression, underscoring their functional relevance in these processes. Analysis of human tumor datasets reveals a strong positive correlation between ZBTB38 and XIAP expression, with elevated ZBTB38 levels associated with high-grade malignancies. Furthermore, Zbtb38 knockdown induces apoptosis in cancer cells with reduced XIAP expression, regardless of p53 expression. Collectively, these findings uncover a novel Zbtb38-XIAP axis that regulates apoptosis during cellular differentiation, development, and oncogenesis, and highlight its therapeutic potential in XIAP-driven and p53-deficient tumors.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

The knowledge behind the changes in the binding affinity can help in understanding the signaling process and designing inhibitors for therapeutic usage. However, accurate prediction of BA for a large number of mutations has been elusive. In this work, for an important calcium binding protein, cardiac Troponin-C, we have developed an integrative modeling approach that combines molecular dynamics (MD) based binding free energy calculations, prediction of plausible mutants using evolutionary information, and an interpretable machine learning model to predict Ca2+ BA for a large number of mutations (seventy-six in all). For the binding free energy calculation, we have used a charge-scaling based MD simulation that considers the polarization in the system, which is critical for divalent ion binding with proteins. The well-known molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) method was used for the binding free energy calculations. The calculated results for twenty-four disease mutants, which are associated with different cardiomyopathies and have experimental binding affinity, are in close agreement with the experimental results. To study other plausible mutations, we have probed the evolutionary landscape of cardiac Troponin-C and used the EVmutation method of Hopf et al.(Nature biotechnology 2017, 35, 128-135) to generate sixty-one additional mutants. Finally, a Support vector regression model was developed for both observed and plausible mutations. Our machine learning model used simple structure and sequence-based descriptors along with MD-based descriptors and gave a mean squared error (MSE) of only 0.16 kcal/mol. Assessment of the contribution of each descriptor shows that the number of water molecules within the Ca2+ binding site, type of amino acid substitution (e.g. polar to hydrophobic reduces the binding affinity), and the distance of mutation with Ca2+ are the most important factors in determining the binding affinity. This integrative modeling can be used for other CBPs and can lay the path for modeling the complex and astronomically large mutational landscape of Calcium binding proteins.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

This expertise is flexible enough to support diverse perceptual judgments: a voice, for example, simultaneously conveys what a talker says, as well as myriad cues about her identity and state. Expert perception across complex signals thus involves discovering and learning regularities that best inform diverse perceptual judgments, as well as weighting this information flexibly as task demands change. Here, we test whether this flexibility may involve endogenous attentional gain. We use two prospective auditory category learning tasks to relate a complex, entirely novel soundscape to four classes of 'alien identity' and two classes of 'alien size.' Identity, but not size, categorization requires discovery and learning of patterned acoustic input situated in one of two simultaneous, non-overlapping frequency bands. This allows us to capitalize on the coarsely segregated frequency-band-specific channels tiling auditory cortex, using fMRI to ask whether category-relevant perceptual information present in one frequency band is prioritized relative to simultaneous, uninformative information in the other frequency band. Among participants expert at alien identity categorization, we observe prioritization of the identity-diagnostic frequency band that persists even when the diagnostic information becomes irrelevant in the size categorization task. Tellingly, the neural selectivity evoked implicitly in the identity categorization task aligns with that in an independent task, where activation is driven by explicit and sustained selective attention to pure tones in one or the other frequency band. Additionally, the learning trajectories taken to achieve expert-level categorization leave fingerprints on the patterns of neural activity associated with the diagnostic dimension. In all, this indicates that acquiring categories can drive the emergence of acquired attentional gain to category-diagnostic input dimensions.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

In this work, we introduce a method, TFacTomo, to learn a Tensor Factorization for RNA Tomography data from cryosections for constructing 3D spatially resolved gene expressions. TFacTomo combines tensor factorization with a loss function supervised by collapsing the tensor entries to match the gene expressions and tissue mask in each cryosection. To incorporate spatial and functional prior, a regularization by a product graph of the PPI network and spatial graphs is also introduced. In the experiments, TFacTomo is applied to two simulation datasets constructed from a 3D ST mouse brain dataset and a 3D ST human heart dataset, and two RNA Tomography datasets, one from zebrafish embryo and the other from mouse olfactory mucosa. In the simulation, TFacTomo significantly outperforms the benchmark method IPF in the accuracy of predicting the ground-truth gene expressions in the ST datasets based on the projected 1D spatial gene expressions of three orthographic views.

Y.; Steidl, W.; Krest, G. J.; Kasi, A.; Kumar, V.", "abstract": "Purpose: Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, mitophagy/autophagy are known to contribute independently to corneal endothelial (CE) apoptosis in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). However, the role of a well-studied specific ER stress pathway (PERK-ATF4-CHOP) in regulating mitochondrial dysfunction, mitophagy/autophagy, and apoptosis is unknown. The purpose of this study is to explore the role of ATF4 in regulating mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy/autophagy, leading to CEnC apoptosis in FECD. Methods: Human corneal endothelial cell line (HCEnC-21T), Fuchs corneal endothelial cell line (F35T), and primary human corneal endothelial cells were treated with ER stressor tunicamycin (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 ug/mL) for 24 and/or 48 hours. ATF4 siRNA was used to knock down ATF4 in 21T cell line and primary corneal endothelial cells. Cell viability was measured using an MTT assay (10 ug/mL tunicamycin for 24 hours). Mitochondrial bioenergetics was analyzed by measuring mitochondria membrane potential (MMP) loss using TMRE assay and ATP production using mitochondrial complex V assay kit at 48 hours post tunicamycin. Mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway proteins, mitophagy, and autophagy marker proteins were analyzed using Western blotting (10 ug/mL tunicamycin for 24 hours). ATF4 +/- and ATF4 +/+ mice were irradiated with UVA to assess pro-apoptotic ER stress and corneal endothelial cell death in vivo. Results: F35T cell line had a significantly increased expression of ER stress pathway molecules (eIF2, ATF4, CHOP) and mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic apoptotic molecules (cleaved PARP, caspase 9, caspase 3) along with mitochondrial fragmentation compared to 21T cells at the baseline, which further increased after treatment with tunicamycin. Mitochondrial membrane potential also significantly decreased in F35T compared to 21T after tunicamycin. ATF4 knockdown after tunicamycin significantly attenuated pro-apoptotic ER and mitochondrial stress molecules, rescued MMP loss, and reduced mitochondrial fragmentation in the 21T cell line and primary corneal endothelial cells. ATF4 knockdown post tunicamycin treatment also downregulated altered/excessive Parkin-mediated mitophagy and Akt/mTOR-mediated autophagy pathway with reduction of caspases, leading to increased cellular viability. ATF4+/- mice had significantly increased CE numbers with improved cellular morphology and decreased CHOP expression compared to ATF4+/+ post-UVA. Conclusions: Pro-apoptotic ATF4 induction under tunicamycin-induced ER stress disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics and dynamics, leading to activation of excessive autophagy/mitophagy. ATF4-induced activation of CHOP plays a key role in switching excessive autophagy to CEnC apoptosis. This study highlights the importance of ATF4 in ER-mitochondrial crosstalk and its contribution to CEnC apoptosis in FECD.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

This study employs large-scale constant-pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations to decode the environment-dependent pKa of aminolipids in the Comirnaty lipid formulation, providing a detailed view of their pH-dependent structural dynamics. Our results reveal a significant shift in the apparent pKa of the aminolipid ALC-0315, from an intrinsic value of 9.3 in water to 4.9 within the LNP environment. This shift arises from the interplay between lipid reorganization and local electrostatic interactions, resulting in distinct protonation states across the LNP core and surface. At low pH, protonated aminolipids dominate the LNP surface, promoting efficient mRNA encapsulation, whereas at neutral pH, deprotonated aminolipids migrate to the hydrophobic core, driving structural stabilization. Notably, the localized pKa of aminolipids varies significantly with their position, decreasing from near-surface regions (7 to 8) to the hydrophobic core ([&le;]4). These findings elucidate the molecular mechanisms underpinning LNP phase transitions and highlight the key role of pKa shifts for the design of aminolipids and for optimizing LNP compositions for enhanced therapeutic delivery.

Advances in population genomics have uncovered supergenes associated with diverse traits, ranging from butterfly wing patterns to floral morphs. In ants, two supergenes on non-homologous social chromosomes in Solenopsis and Formica are associated with social polymorphism, with either single queen (monogyne) or multiple queens (polygyne) colonies. We discovered a new supergene associated with similar polymorphism in the desert ant Cataglyphis niger. Despite Cataglyphis being more closely related to Formica than Solenopsis, its social chromosome is homologous to that of Solenopsis, with conservation of synteny in gene content and order. This suggests that the social chromosome is ancient, dating back to the common ancestor of Solenopsis and Cataglyphis, at least 90 million years ago. Low sequence divergence between supergene haplotypes in both Solenopsis and Cataglyphis suggests that the two supergenes evolved recently and independently in the two divergent lineages on this ancient social chromosome. Comparative analysis of hymenopteran genomes further revealed a bee chromosome homologous to the ant social chromosome. The ant social chromosome contains the largest set of genes that are conserved as a linkage group across ant and bee genomes. This conserved gene set is enriched for olfactory functions, most notably a large number of odorant-binding proteins. The conservation of this gene set suggests that this chromosome plays an important role in social behavior across social Hymenoptera.

In this model organism, Yki upregulation drives benign tissue overgrowth in imaginal discs. Our research shows that the conserved metabolic regulator dPGC1 restricts Yki-driven tissue hyperplasia and helps maintain epithelial integrity in vivo. Combined Yki upregulation and dPGC1 depletion results in tumors characterized by enlarged mitochondria and upregulation of genes promoting mitochondrial fusion, a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for Yki-driven oncogenic growth. We further demonstrate that mitochondrial enlargement is associated with increased levels of the cell cycle regulator Cyclin E, which is critical for tumor development.

The amino acid transporter SLC7A5 is markedly upregulated following LPS stimulation, and conditional deletion of Slc7a5 impairs B cell proliferation, underscoring its essential role in B cell activation. LPS also elevates intracellular cholesterol levels, and inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme HMG-CoA reductase blocks proliferation. This effect was mediated by a dual requirement for cholesterol metabolism and protein prenylation downstream of HMG-CoA reductase. Notably, this was not unique to TLR4 signalling but is also observed in B cells activated via TLR7, TLR9, CD40, or the B cell receptor. Together, these findings reveal that metabolic rewiring, including amino acid uptake and cholesterol metabolism, is an essential feature of B cell activation and proliferation.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

This trend was consistent in four different activation domains and their mutants. This effect further held for activation domains appended to three different structural classes of DBDs. Stronger activation domains with high chromatin-bound fractions also exhibited increased binding to the p300 coactivator in proximity-assisted photoactivation experiments.

We propose that deviance-driven neural dynamics are generated by ensembles of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that have a fundamental inhibitory connectivity motif: competitive inhibition between reciprocally connected neural representations under modulation from feed-forward selective (dis)inhibition. Implementing this motif in two computational models with different levels of biophysical abstraction, we were able to simulate a variety of phenomena pertaining to the experimentally observed shifts in neural tuning during DD across neurons, time, and stimulus history.

Experiment I in this study examined behaviors and vocalizations associated with male-female social interactions. Based on several behaviors, we distinguished more general, courtship-type interactions from mating interactions involving mounting or attempted mounting behaviors. We then compared vocalizations between courtship and mating. The increase in behavioral intensity from courtship to mating was associated with altered syllable composition, more harmonic structure, lower minimum frequency, longer duration, reduced inter-syllable interval, and increased sound intensity. We then used these features to construct highly salient playback stimuli associated with mating. In Experiment II, we compared behavioral responses to playback of these mating sequences with responses to playback of aversive vocal sequences produced by restrained mice, described in previous studies. Subjects were females in estrus and males. We observed a range of behavioral responses. Some (e.g., Attending and Stretch-Attend) showed similar responses across playback type and sex, while others were context dependent (e.g., Flinching, Locomotion). Still other behaviors showed either an effect of sex (e.g., Self-Grooming, Still-and-Alert) or an interaction between playback type and sex (Escape). These results demonstrate both state-dependent features of mouse vocalizations and their effectiveness in evoking a range of behavioral responses, independent of contextual cues provided by other sensory stimuli or behavioral interactions.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

The PVT was administered three times in short-wavelength 'blue' light [SWL, high melanopic illuminance], long-wavelength 'red' light [LWL, low melanopic illuminance], and bright white light [BWL] of high correlated color temperature, and white dim light [DL] as the control condition. PVT measures included fluctuations in attention, quantified as intra-individual Reaction Time (RT) variability and the number of lapses; mean RT; and optimum response capability (10% fastest RTs). Compared to DL, participants had significantly fewer lapses and faster mean RT during SWL and LWL, and they enhanced their optimum response capability during LWL. There were no significant effects of BWL, and light did not appear to have effects on RT variability. Surprisingly, SWL was not superior to LWL. Hence, our results suggest that light, irrespective of melanopic illuminance, has the potential to increase alertness and attention during daytime.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Stratigraphic intervals help us estimate two important quantities from the fossil record of a given lineage, its origination and extinction times. Many models are available in the literature. This toolset is complemented here by proposing a flexible method which allows to estimate origination and extinction times, as well as model preservation potential in flexible ways. A method is presented for representing the stratigraphic interval as a continuous distribution by integrating over parameter uncertainty through the use of the posterior predictive distribution. It is possible then to combine these distributions using conflation, to build a time probabilistic model for the co-occurrence of these intervals. Empirical examples using Palynomorphs and the origination time of the marine Barracudas are used for illustrating the potential of the method.

Haplotypes, which combine alleles from adjacent variants, offer several advantages over bi-allelic SNPs, including enhanced information content, reduced dimensionality, and improved statistical power in genomic studies. These benefits are particularly significant for polyploid species, where distinguishing all homologous copies using SNP markers alone can be challenging. This article introduces HaploCharmer, a flexible workflow designed for read-scale haplotype calling from NGS data. HaploCharmer identifies haplotypes within preconfigured genomic regions smaller than a sequencing read, ensuring direct comparability across individuals. It integrates a series of processing steps including mapping, haplotype identification, filtration, and reporting of haplotype sequences, as presence-absence, in the panel of accessions analyzed. The performance of HaploCharmer was validated by building a genetic map using whole-genome sequencing data from a highly polyploid sugarcane cultivar (R570) and its self-progeny, and performing a diversity analysis in the polyploid Saccharum genus using targeted sequencing data. The workflow successfully identified a large number of high-quality haplotypes, with less than 1% of false positives. The dense genetic map obtained using single-dose haplotypes accurately depicted the known genome architecture of the R570 cultivar, including large chromosome rearrangements. The diversity analysis accurately reflected the known genetic structure within this genus. It also allowed inferring ancestral origins to mapped haplotypes and the corresponding chromosome segments in the R570 genetic map. HaploCharmer provides a robust method for diversity, genetic mapping, and quantitative genetics studies in both diploid and polyploid species.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we propose a consensus mapping that bridges the two species' cortical atlases and allows for direct area-to-area comparison of their connectomes, which are then used to build comparative computational large-scale modeling of the frontoparietal circuit for working memory. We found that the macaque model exhibits resilience against distractors, a prerequisite for normal working memory function. By contrast, the marmoset model predicts a sensitivity to distractibility commonly observed behaviorally in this species. Surprisingly, this contrasting trend can be swapped by scaling intrafrontal and frontoparietal, and offer a credible prediction to the marmoset's behavior in this specific task.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

The ability to restore functional tumor suppressor protein from mutant driver TSGs is a longstanding aspiration in cancer therapy, however, current strategies face formidable challenges in recovering proteins harboring heterogeneous mutations and circumventing dominant-negative effects exerted by endogenous mutant proteins. Therefore, the development of therapeutic interventions that are effective and generalizable across diverse nonsense mutations in cancer, to rescue endogenous mutant tumor suppressor proteins remains an urgent yet unmet need. Here we describe a Double 'Suppressor Strategy' that engineered suppressor transfer RNA (sup-tRNA) could overcome nonsense mutations in key driver tumor suppressor genes, such as TP53, enabling the restoration of full-length p53 with its original or enhanced transcriptional activity through the precise incorporation of desired amino acids. Moreover, Optimized sup-tRNAs, designed guided by a computational model, could effectively suppress tumor cell proliferation by targeted readthrough of nonsense mutations in different tumor suppressor genes. In two xenograft models harboring nonsense mutant TP53, we observed up to a 60% reduction in tumor weight after sup-tRNA treatment, along with robust recovery of p53 expression and function, and no hematological or histological abnormalities detected. Our findings demonstrate the potential of sup-tRNA as a feasible and effective strategy to rescue and enhance tumor suppressor protein function, thereby preventing cancer development. As a novel therapeutic RNA, sup-tRNA provides a flexible strategy for targeting driver mutations in cancer, thereby expanding the potential of tRNA-based therapy in precision oncology.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Cognitive models are widely used in psychology and neuroscience to formulate and test hypotheses about cognitive processes. These processes are characterized by model parameters, which are then used for scientific inference. The reliability of scientific conclusions from cognitive modeling depends critically on the reliability of parameter estimation, yet estimating parameters remains a universal challenge particularly when data are too limited to constrain them. In such cases, multiple sets of parameters may explain the experimental data equally well within the same model, raising the question of which parameters are scientifically meaningful. We refer to this problem as \\textit{parameter ambiguity}. In this paper, we investigate parameter ambiguity in reinforcement learning under two optimization methods. We employ the de facto Nelder-Mead method (\\texttt{fminsearch}) and a neural network trained to estimate parameters using a modern deep learning pipeline, which has seen limited application in cognitive modeling. Across ten decision-making datasets, we consistently find that the two methods produce substantially different parameter estimates despite achieving nearly identical fitting performance. To address this ambiguity, we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that goes beyond predictive accuracy to assess generalizability, robustness, identifiability, and test-retest reliability, thereby offering principled guidance on which parameter estimates should inform scientific inference. Applying this framework reveals that the neural network with a deep learning pipeline outperforms across these metrics. Our study establishes parameter ambiguity as an underappreciated challenge with significant implications for scientific replicability, highlighting that the choice of optimization method is a critical factor shaping scientific conclusions. We advocate for our multi-faceted evaluation approach to ensure reliable scientific inference and for broader integration of modern deep learning pipelines into cognitive modeling.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Although modern surface-based methods have advanced our understanding of protein-protein and protein-ligand kinetics, they rely on immobilized samples, preventing the study of interactions under native conditions and leading to an incomplete understanding. In this work, we propose a paradigm shift by introducing a new method based on flow-induced dispersion analysis to study interaction kinetics while keeping biomolecules in solution, eliminating the need for surface immobilization and thereby preserving molecular mobility and avoiding structural constraints. The method examines reactions outside equilibrium conditions by inducing a rapid concentration change in one of the binding partners (C-Jump) in a controlled microfluidic environment. Notably, it operates without buffer restrictions and requires only minimal sample quantities. We demonstrate C-Jumps capability by accurately determining the association and dissociation rates of both protein-protein and protein-small molecule interactions. Furthermore, we validate its robustness by measuring the rates of a protein-protein interaction in human serum as well as a protein-small molecule interaction in-solution and label free. This underlines C-Jumps broad applicability for studying biomolecular interactions under native conditions, offering a powerful tool for advancing protein engineering and drug discovery, as well as enabling the characterization of previously inaccessible interactions.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Our data suggest listeners rapidly adapt to statistical characteristics of an environment to improve speech understanding. This ability is impaired when rTMS is applied bilaterally to the dlPFC. The data demonstrate that speech understanding in noise is best when exposed to a room with reverberant characteristics common to human-built environments, with performance declining for higher and lower reverberation times, including fully anechoic (non-reverberant) environments.

However, how well they also contribute to maintaining ecosystem functions that plant diversity supports has rarely been explicitly tested, often due to the lack of historical ecosystem function data. Here, we used a trait-based approach to reconstruct past ecosystem functioning and examine its change over the last 15 years in protected and unprotected coastal dune ecosystems, checking where functions remain stable over time. First, we resurveyed vegetation in quasi-permanent plots and measured in the present several ecosystem functions related to biomass production, carbon, water, nutrient cycling, erosion control, and invasion resistance across six coastal dune sites in Central Italy. Second, using these data, we quantified Biodiversity-Ecosystem Function (BEF) relationships and employed them to hindcast past ecosystem functions based on historical vegetation surveys. Finally, as a case study, we applied this method to assess temporal changes in ecosystem functioning under three protection regimes: national protected areas (i.e. strict protection), Natura 2000 sites (loose protection), and non-protected areas. Biomass production, carbon, and water regulation increased over time in non-protected areas, likely due to an expansion of ruderal and non-native species, that are usually more productive. Within Natura 2000 sites, communities showed a decrease in erosion control and invasion resistance, due to the loss of important dune-building species and the spread of non-natives. Only within national protected areas, ecosystem functions did not undergo significant temporal changes, and invasion resistance even increased. Our results suggest that ecosystem functioning remained stable over time only in areas under strict protection. More broadly, our study demonstrates the potential for using revisitation data in combination with locally estimated BEF relationships to hindcast past ecosystem functioning, providing a valuable tool for monitoring long-term functional changes in response to conservation measures.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

In tailed bacteriophages and herpesviruses, the genome is packaged through the conserved Portal complex, a dodecameric ring embedded in the capsid at a single vertex. After genome packaging is complete, the Portal complex connects to the Tail, which is required for host recognition and infection. Portal and the proteins that connect it to the Tail form the Neck complex, which controls genome retention in the capsid. We determined the Neck and Portal Vertex structure of the hyperthermophilic phage P74-26 using cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM). Because this phage inhabits an extremely harsh environment, it is an excellent model to study principles of thermostability and viral maturation. We describe a thermostability mechanism wherein the Portal Vertex is stabilized by highly intertwined loop structures, like in a wicker basket. Moreover, by comparing the mature virion Neck to published structures of procapsids and empty mature capsids, we observe that the Portal protrudes from the capsid upon completion of genome packaging. We propose that this repositioning of the Portal underlies a pressure-sensitive switch that terminates genome packaging and triggers Tail attachment in many phages.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

R.; Shatby, A.", "abstract": "Multiple studies have reported genes in the M. tuberculosis (Mtb) genome that are under diversifying selection, based on genetic variants among Mtb clinical isolates. These might reflect adaptions to selection pressures associated with modern clinical treatment of TB. Many, but not all, of these genes under selection are related to drug resistance. Most of these studies have evaluated selection at the gene-level. However, positive selection can be evaluated on different scales, including individual sites (codons) and local regions within an ORF. In this paper, we use GenomegaMap, a Bayesian method for calculating selection, to evaluate selection of genes in the Mtb genome at all three levels. We present evidence that the intermediate analysis (windows of codons) provides the most credible list of candidate genes under selection. A further advantage of this approach is that it identifies specific regions within proteins that are under selective pressure, which is useful for structural and functional interpretation. In an analysis of two separate collections of Mtb clinical isolates (from Moldova; and a globally-representative set), we observed 53 and 178 significant genes under selection, with 36% overlap. The lists of genes under selection include many drug-resistance genes, as well as other genes that have previously been reported to be under selection (resR, phoR). The specific regions under selection identified within drug-resistance genes are shown to correspond to protein structural features known to be involved in resistance, supporting accuracy of the method. Positive selection in several ESX-1-related genes was also observed, suggesting adaptation to immune pressure.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Heterochiasmy is particularly notable on small chromosomes, and at both ends of the chromosomes. Yet, no difference in shuffling has been found between populations.

Oscillatory cortico-subthalamic patterns associated with dyskinesia are proposed as adaptive neuromodulation biomarkers, but their dependence on behavioral states such as dyskinetic movement presence or suppression remains unknown. We studied cortico-subthalamic oscillations in 22 Parkinson patients during dyskinesia-evoking protocols. We clinically differentiated between non-dyskinetic and dyskinetic periods, and defined movement presence with kinematics, leading to four behavioral states containing rest, voluntary movements, movement suppression during dyskinesia, and dyskinetic movements. Elevated subthalamic theta-activity and attenuated beta-activity was found during both dyskinetic movement suppression and execution, while cortico-subthalamic gamma-activity only increased during dyskinetic movement execution. Subthalamic spectral changes significantly predicted dyskinesia presence, and movement presence significantly affected the predictive performance.

Here, we report MYD88 mutations, including lymphoma-associated and novel variants in blood cells of the general population and newly diagnosed solid cancer patients. MYD88 CHIP mutations in HSPCs activate NF-kB, indicating a gain-of-function activity. Modeling MYD88 CHIP in mice, Myd88-L252P (equivalent of human L265P) expression resulted in a competitive fitness advantage of HSPCs. Myd88-L252P HSPCs exhibit a myeloid cell bias and inflammation, leading to hematologic disease. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicated that Myd88-L252P expands distinct hematopoietic and immune cell clusters and activates immune-related pathways in HSPCs. An IRAK1/4 inhibitor suppressed MYD88-dependent NF-kB activation and reversed Myd88-L252P cell expansion.

IT delivery of DT reduced Treg frequencies in the tumor, which promoted potent tumor control without autoimmunity. Interestingly, this control was principally mediated by CD4+ T cells, whereas CD8+ T cells only contributed when CD4+ T cells were absent. While conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were required to clear tumors, Batf3+ cDC1s were dispensable. Distant secondary tumors, mimicking metastases, were also controlled by IT Treg ablation. Mechanistically, IT Tregs suppressed antitumor T cell responses by blocking the acquisition of tumor antigen by cDC2s.

Tom70 is a mitochondrial surface receptor which recognizes precursors and serves as an interface between mitochondrial protein import and the cytosolic proteostasis network. Mitochondrial import defects trigger a complex stress response, in which compromised protein synthesis rates are a characteristic element. The molecular interplay that connects mitochondrial (dys)function to cytosolic translation rates in yeast cells is however poorly understood. Here, we show that the deletion of the two Tom70 paralogs of yeast (TOM70 and TOM71) leads to defects in mitochondrial biogenesis and slow cell growth. Surprisingly, upon heat stress, the deletion of ZUO1, a chaperone of the ribosome-associated complex (RAC), largely prevented the slow growth and the reduced translation rates in the tom70{Delta}/tom71{Delta} double deletion mutant. In contrast, the mitochondrial defects were not cured but even enhanced by ZUO1 deletion. Our study shows that Zuo1 is a critical component in the signaling pathway that mutes protein synthesis upon mitochondrial dysfunction. We propose a novel paradigm according to which RAC serves as a stress-controlled regulatory element of the cytosolic translation machinery.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A) is a known regulator of cell quiescence, though the mechanisms underlying its function remain unclear. Previous studies have shown that pharmacological inhibition of DYRK1A using harmine induces cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) MI. Here, we developed a computational network model of DYRK1A-mediated regulation of the cell cycle, which predicts how DYRK1A inhibition promotes cardiomyocyte re-entry. To validate these predictions, we tested selective DYRK1A inhibitors and observed robust induction of cell cycle activity in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Integrating our network model with bulk RNA-sequencing data from DYRK1A inhibitor-treated NRCMs, we identified E2F1 as a key transcriptional driver of cell cycle gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate that both pharmacological and post-developmental inhibition of DYRK1A enhances heart function and increases cardiomyocyte cycling following I/R MI. Our findings suggest that functional recovery induced by small molecule inhibitor of DYRK1A is mediated by the induction of cycling cardiomyocytes.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Vegetation changed coherently across the glacial-Holocene transition, with trait shifts mirroring functional composition. Connectivity peaked during the late MIS3 and Last Glacial Maximum--likely aided by the Bering Land Bridge, mass effects and facilitation--collapsed during the Deglacial with rapid turnover, and rebounded in the Holocene as shrub and boreal communities expanded. Temporal zeta within sites exceeded spatial zeta, indicating strong local persistence and resilience. Tundra sites uninvaded by forest maintained continuous species pools.

Using structural equation modelling (SEM), we disentangled direct and indirect effects of host abundances on LB hazard (i.e., DIN). Rodent abundance was associated with higher DIN through its positive effect on NIP (pathogen amplification), while showing no effect on DON. Cervids increased DON (vector amplification) but decreased NIP (pathogen dilution). Our study suggests that in boreal forests the vectors may be supported by very low cervid densities and, as a virtual absence of rodents did not eliminate the pathogen, the pathogen is likely to persist through very low rodent densities.

Here, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli, a bacterium identified in non-gut tissues of Aedes albopictus and experimentally reintroduced into axenic Drosophila melanogaster, alters both larval and adult sensory-driven behaviors. In larvae, E. coli infection modified phototaxis and mechanosensory responses across genotypes, while tunneling and thermosensory behaviors were specifically dependent on the ionotropic receptor co-receptor IR25a. In adults, E. coli increased attraction to fermentation cues (apple cider vinegar, ethanol) and enhanced sucrose consumption in wild-type and Orco-deficient flies, but not in IR25a-deficient mutants. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that E. coli shifted cuticular hydrocarbon composition toward shorter-chain alkanes and increased the sex pheromone 9-tricosene in an IR25a-dependent manner. Together, these findings show that E. coli broadly reprograms insect sensory behavior, with IR25a serving as a critical mediator of microbial influence on chemosensory and physiological traits.

Over 13 months, routine clinical diagnostics identified recurring isolates ofcarbapenem-resistant Citrobacter species carrying Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and/or OXA-48-like carbapenemases from patient screening and hospital drain samples. While routine diagnostic approaches provided limited insights into the carbapenem resistance dynamics, we show that near-complete de novo assembly of chromosomes and plasmids by long-read nanopore sequencing allowed for high-resolution strain identification, plasmid profiling, and antibiotic resistance gene detection. Notably, genomically nearly indistinguishable Citrobacter freundii of the high-risk sequence type (ST)91 genomes were recovered from screening samples collected in the same hospital room one year apart.

However, in many cases, this may be misleading because the regions under study are not independent. The overlap between candidate regions may not be due to the robustness of the methods, but rather to the structure of the data itself. Results: This paper contributes to solving this issue by developing a test that compares, for a set of SNPs, the observed distribution of distances between candidates from different methods with that expected by chance for the same SNP dataset. The test is incorporated into the KLinterSel program, which also calculates clusters of sites that intersect between different methods within a given distance.

BHaM includes two datasets: (1) a population dataset (n = 726 adults) describing hand strength (pinch and grip), self-reported hand function (Michigan Hand Questionnaire), and anthropometric measurements (from photographs), and (2) a biomechanics dataset (n = 30 adults) describing kinematics (marker-based motion capture), kinetics (isometric and isokinetic data), and electromyography (surface and fine wire) during 19 tasks across the elbow, wrist, and hand. A subset of the biomechanics dataset (n = 15 adults) also includes magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder through wrist. Participants for both datasets were recruited to represent a diverse population of healthy adults, ranging from 18 to 91 years.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

To address this, we present the Darwin-Godel Drug Discovery Machine (DGDM), a self-improving artificial intelligence framework that integrates generative molecular design and evolution with adaptive meta-learning. DGDM employs a dual-loop architecture: an inner loop frames molecular optimization as a Darwinian evolutionary process guided by reinforcement learning signals, where candidate molecules generated by generative AI are evolved through search and feedback; an outer loop adaptively modifies the discovery pipeline itself. Unlike the original Godel machine, which demands formal proofs of improvement-rarely attainable in practice-DGDM uses statistical validation to bound risk and ensure reliable progress. The framework is fully compatible with modern structural biology tools, including AlphaFold, and supports evaluation through docking, binding affinity prediction, and ADMET profiling. In a proof-of-concept study, DGDM improved the median binding affinity of candidate ligands from -4.457 to -5.422 kcal/mol while maintaining 100% drug-likeness and novelty. These results suggest that bounded-risk, self-improving AI can accelerate drug discovery by continuously refining both molecular design and discovery processes, extending the Godel machine principle of self-improvement into biomedical research.

However, existing deep learning-based foundational models for cells have predominantly focused on human or murine systems, with a relative scarcity of research on model microorganisms such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Furthermore, these models often exhibit limitations in the integration of biological prior knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce scYeast, the first foundational cell model specifically designed for yeast that deeply integrates biological priors. scYeast features an innovative asymmetric parallel architecture that embeds transcriptional regulatory prior information directly into the Transformer's attention mechanism, thereby systematically incorporating and leveraging established biological knowledge during model training. After large-scale pre-training on single-cell transcriptomics data from yeast, scYeast demonstrates robust generalization capabilities and strong biological interpretability. It can perform zero-shot tasks, such as inferring specific regulatory relationships and resolving critical cell states, functional types, and developmental trajectories. Moreover, by constructing fine-tuning networks, scYeast excels at tasks including cell type identification, doubling time prediction, and forecasting responses to gene perturbations. Further leveraging transfer learning, scYeast can be adapted to other multi-omics data, such as proteomics, expanding its application boundaries in systems biology research. scYeast not only provides a novel tool for fundamental research in yeast single-cell biology but also establishes a new paradigm for the organic fusion of foundational models with prior knowledge, laying a solid groundwork for synthetic and systems biology.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Methods: We validated the classification performance of 13 gene signatures unique for PD (published 2015-2025) using the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. We further validated classification performance on data collected in a prospective clinical trial where demographic and clinical parameters were minimized and environmental confounders were strictly controlled. Sources of gene expression variability were studied by mean pairwise distance analysis. Results: Gene overlap between signatures was low (11/411, 2.7%) but statistically significant (P<0.001) and enriched with genes involved in lipid metabolism. The majority (10/13) of these signatures retained statistical significance when tested on the PPMI dataset, but their classification performance was modest (median AUC 59.7%), substantially lower than originally reported. Classification performance improved when comparing GBA1-associated PD to controls (median AUC 65.4%, P=0.006). A prospective trial (16 PD patients, 14 controls) with rigorous environmental standardization did not improve classification accuracy. Inter-individual expression variability is the dominant limiting factor in classifier performance. Variability was not impacted by long-term levodopa therapy. Interpretation: While blood transcriptomic signatures unique to PD are reproducible and may elucidate PD pathophysiology, their broad clinical utility remains severely limited by inherent inter-individual variability. Future research should prioritize biomarkers of divergence rather than the pursuit of a universal PD signature.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

J. G. B.", "abstract": "Clustering single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data remains a major challenge due to high dimensionality and noise. Despite numerous benchmarking studies aiming to identify the best clustering methods, many suffer from methodological flaws that undermine their conclusions. A major challenge in benchmarking is selecting representative datasets that cover the diversity of scRNA-seq experiments and include laboratory-verified labels for reliable evaluation. Consistent preprocessing of all inputs to benchmarked algorithms is crucial, as it significantly impacts performance. Beyond selecting an algorithm, thorough exploration of hyperparameters is essential to assess robustness and identify configurations that maximize performance. After identifying common methodological issues in clustering benchmarking studies, we propose a new benchmarking framework designed to address these limitations. Our framework mitigates potential biases from referential labels that may have been produced with the aid of clustering, enabling inclusion of more datasets beyond the pool of gold-standard datasets with purely lab-verified labels. We illustrate our methodology by comparing the classic Leiden and Louvain clustering algorithms, with extensive hyperparameter exploration resulting in 34,911,660 combinations across 22 datasets. The results did not reveal significant performance differences between the algorithms. We also show that overlooked factors, such as graph construction and quality functions, critically influence clustering outcomes. Jaccard-weighted graphs paired with best-performing quality functions maximize performance, while UMAP-weighted graphs can be more robust to fluctuations in the neighborhood size k for k-nearest neighbors graph construction. In general, our framework establishes a more reliable standard for benchmarking scRNA-seq clustering algorithms and sets a foundation for more accurate evaluation in future studies.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Niclosamide, an FDA approved anthelmintic agent with mitochondrial uncoupling activity, has shown promise as an anticancer agent. However, off target mitochondrial toxicity has rendered the utility of this agent at clinically effective doses. Here, we synthesize a variety of prodrugs on the niclosamide template based on the Baylis-Hillman (BH) reaction, with the hypothesis that niclosamide will be released upon the reaction with cellular nucleophiles, including thiols. Consistent with this hypothesis, the BH-prodrugs release the parent niclosamide in the presence of cysteine and glutathione, and the cancer cell proliferation inhibition properties of the lead candidates are retained when compared to the parent niclosamide. Mitochondrial respiration assays illustrate that niclosamide acutely uncouples the mitochondria, and the lead BH-prodrug 6b does not, providing evidence of this prodrug strategy in mitigating off target toxicities. In a dose escalation study, the lead candidate 6b is generally well tolerated in healthy mice as evidenced by zero mortality, normal grooming pattern, and normal weight gains. Finally, 6b exhibits 54% volume tumor growth inhibition properties in a syngraft model of breast cancer in mice.

Using in-vivo B-mode ultrasound processed with a custom automated fascicle tracking application and EMG measurements to drive Hill-type models of muscle force, we investigated mechanical energetics of the rectus femoris in 7 individuals who experienced rapid, transient unilateral belt accelerations during walking. We hypothesized that: H1) the rectus femoris would actively lengthen on the perturbed leg during the perturbed stride and H2) on the contralateral leg the rectus femoris would reflect the mechanical energetic demand at the knee and leg levels. H1 was partially supported, with the rectus femoris fascicles being decoupled from muscle-tendon unit lengthening. H2 was not supported, with the rectus femoris best reflecting the energetic role of the hip, as opposed to the knee or leg.

Here, we present results from our analysis of data from the Dog Aging Project, a long-term longitudinal study of aging in more than 50,000 companion dogs.

We also find that across these independent human studies, the biomarkers identified are also highly correlated, strongly suggesting a general signature of mortality within the plasma metabolome across humans, and now in dogs as well. Given the many similarities between dogs and humans with respect to genetics, environment, disease, and disease treatment, and the fact that dogs are so much shorter lived than humans, we argue that dogs represent an extremely valuable translational model in our ongoing effort to understand the underlying molecular causes and consequences of age-related morbidity and mortality in humans.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we uncovered an eccentric role of nuclear FetA in visceral white adipocytes of obese T2D conditions. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1  (HIF-1 ) facilitates the nuclear translocation of FetA via direct interaction, a process that promotes the emergence of a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). While nuclear co-localization of FetA and HIF-1  strongly promotes adipocyte senescence, silencing FetA alone is sufficient to prevent senescence, even in conditions of HIF-1 overexpression or lipid-rich hypoxic stress. Although nuclear FetA does not directly bind to DNA, it enhances HIF-1 transcriptional activity, potentiating the activation of senescence markers such as {beta}-galactosidase and p53. Selective knockdown of FetA in obese mice reduced adipocyte senescence in visceral white adipose tissue and improved fasting glycemic control. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unrecognized function for FetA in orchestrating adipocyte senescence in obesity, establishing nuclear FetA as a potential therapeutic target for obesity.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Current APA analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) for establishing cell-type-specific APA landscapes primarily rely on Read2 data, which lacks precise cleavage site (CS) information. This limitation hinders their ability to achieve precise de novo mapping of polyadenylation site (PAS). Here, we present scPAISO, a computational pipeline designed for de novo identification of PAS and quantification of PAS isoforms in scRNA-seq data, by leveraging the often-discarded Read1 from 3' tag-based scRNA-seq protocols. Unlike existing tools, scPAISO directly captures mRNA 3' end cleavage sites, enabling superior performance in motif enrichment (stronger AAUAAA signal) and peak precision (sharper PAS peaks). And sharper peak widths enhance spatial resolution, allowing for more accurate detection of closely spaced PAS in the genome. By integrating Read1 and Read2 data, scPAISO achieves isoform-level quantification with an assignment accuracy exceeding 95%.

However, emerging evidence suggests that weight loss may paradoxically increase the risk of CVD and atherosclerosis in certain populations. Motivated by these counterintuitive findings, we hypothesized that mild weight loss may induce metabolic reprogramming that promotes atherogenesis, potentially via an upregulation of pro-atherogenic lipids. Methods: Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were fed either a standard Chow or a high-cholesterol/high-fat (HCHF) diet for six months. A subset in each group underwent mild caloric restriction to achieve ~5% body weight reduction. Atherosclerotic plaque burden in the brachiocephalic artery was assessed histologically. Hepatic lipidomic profiling was conducted via ESI-MS/MS, and lipid changes were compared with published plasma lipidomic data from obese human subjects stratified by CVD and diabetes status. Cardiovascular risk was further evaluated using the ceramide risk score (CERT1). Results: Mild weight loss induced significant plaque growth, increasing lesion area by 28% in Chow-fed and 53.8% in HCHF-fed mice relative to controls. In HCHF-fed mice, caloric restriction markedly elevated free cholesterol and multiple pro-atherogenic phospholipids, including nine phosphatidylcholine, six phosphatidylethanolamine, one lysophosphatidylcholine, two sphingomyelin, and three ceramide species. Seven cholesterol esters also increased, and a CERT1 score of 8.1 indicated high CVD risk. These pro-atherogenic lipids were confirmed by comparison with published plasma lipidomic data from CVD and diabetes patients. In contrast, weight loss under Chow conditions caused minimal lipid alterations, with only isolated increases in phosphatidylcholine and lysophosphatidylcholine species. Conclusions: Mild weight loss under high-fat dietary conditions accelerates atherosclerosis through increased production of pro-atherogenic lipids. These findings underscore the need to monitor lipidomic responses during weight loss interventions in obese individuals with CVD risk.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Understanding how sanctions are applied by plants and how bacteria may try to avoid them is important to understand the stability of legume-rhizobial symbioses. Using near isogenic Rhizobium leguminosarum strains on pea we demonstrate that sanctions are sensitive to the proportion of nodules occupied by a less effective strain and by using split roots show that sanctions are applied based on global comparisons of nodules across the plants root system. By using several rhizobia with different levels of fixation, but all derived from the same parent, we show that pea plants can differentiate between bacteria with relatively small variations in fixation effectiveness. We demonstrate that peas integrate global and local signals in order to determine whether individual nodules are sanctioned.

COCH suppresses cytokinin levels and response during nodule formation, as cytokinin levels are elevated in Pscoch abnormal nodules and this is mirrored by ectopic cytokinin-responsive TCSn::GUS expression in Pscoch nodule apices, nodule vasculature and in root-like tissue. In contrast, PsCOCH promotes auxin accumulation and precise auxin response patterning in nodules, as Pscoch mutants show significantly reduced auxin levels and severely altered auxin-responsive DR5::GUS expression patterns. RNAseq analysis revealed that Pscoch developing nodules have gene expression profiles more similar to root primordia, with increased expression of defence and auxin response genes (IAA and ARF) and reduced expression of cytokinin biosynthesis genes (IPT3, CYP735A and LOG2) compared to wild type. We found gibberellin is unlikely to act downstream of PsCOCH, as Pscoch and gibberellin-deficient double mutants still form root-nodule hybrids. Ectopic constitutive expression of PsCOCH also produces root-nodule hybrids and we found intriguing links between autoregulation of nodulation pathway and COCH, suggesting that a complex feedback mechanism acts in COCH control of nodule identity.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Here we introduce dextran-lipid droplets as versatile exogenous synthetic compartments, that are readily uptaken by model cancer and immune cells and are stable inside cells for days. Furthermore, the droplets can encapsulate nucleic acids with high efficiency, are non-toxic and endosomal escape occurs when formulated with ionizable lipids, as shown by reporter protein translation of an mRNA hosted inside the organelles.

R.", "abstract": "In an everyday task, such as planting spring flowers, the eyes typically fixate target objects that we manipulate. When reaching to a target object, gaze shifts away from the reach target to a secondary saccade target, presented during the reach, are delayed until after the reach target has been attained--a phenomenon known as gaze anchoring. Here, we compared gaze anchoring in human participants when reaching to a visual target versus a visual-haptic target providing force feedback upon contact. We also examined gaze anchoring in a bimanual context in which participants were instructed to shift their gaze to the secondary saccade target as soon as it appeared and, at the same time, move their other hand to the secondary saccade target. We found that, during the reaching movement, gaze was anchored to the target for both visual and visual-haptic targets. Whereas in the visual condition gaze appeared to be anchored until the end of the reaching movement, in the visual-haptic condition, gaze appeared to be anchored until the hand was close to the target (i.e., the end of the directing phase). In two-handed reaching, gaze anchoring was observed but anchoring did not extend to the left hand, which started moving before the eyes. Overall, our findings indicate that the timing of eye and hand movements in object manipulation is linked to the function of target fixations.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

To this end, several parameters must be set during the processing of structural and functional data, and a variety of output features have been proposed. While emerging applications of the GSP framework have shown clear merits to reveal the neural underpinnings of brain disorders, behavioural facets or individuality, at present, the optimal parameter choices and feature types for an outcome of interest remain unknown. Here, we fill this gap by conducting a large-scale comparative analysis across parameter choices and candidate feature types. First, we show that all the studied factors of variation within the GSP pipeline significantly modulate feature vector patterns and feature coefficient values, evidencing the importance of an exhaustive characterization. Second, focusing on the ability to fingerprint individual subjects, we demonstrate that power spectral density and the structural decoupling index are the most all-around feature types, which harmoniously balance robustness to external sources of variation (head movement and acquisition settings), parsimony of the telling feature set, and generalization to altered parcellation specificities. Our results emphasize the importance, for future GSP studies, of carefully considering the undertaken structural connectivity and functional parameter choices as a function of the outcome measure of interest. More globally, they also highlight the relevance of large-scale comparative strategies in optimizing an analytical pipeline towards a specific goal. Our reported methodology can seamlessly be extended to other analytical approaches and outcome measures of interest, which we hope will be of use for future researchers in and outside the GSP subfield.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we have studied the effects on the host of OMVs prepared from one of the most potent pathogens of Drosophila melanogaster, Serratia marcescens. OMV injection leads to the apparent demise of flies within few hours. We identify a number of host defenses that somewhat protect it from the action of OMVs, namely the systemic humoral immunity pathway Immune deficiency, Prophenol Oxidases 1&2, and the redox active enzymes Dual oxidase, NADPH-oxidase, and Nitric Oxygen Synthase. In contrast, unidentified hemocyte function(s) and the circulating protease Hayan promote the pathogenicity of OMVs. Mechanistically, we find that OMVs promote the activation of the JNK pathway and the transient expression of the pro-apoptotic genes head-involution defective and reaper in at least neurons. Our data suggest that mitochondrially-derived reactive oxygen species promote neuronal cell death that leads to the paralysis of OMV-injected flies. We identify the metalloprotease PrtA as a major virulence factor of OMVs and show that the injection of purified PrtA mimics most of the effects of OMVs. Finally, our data further indicate that PrtA contributes to the pathogenicity of injected Serratia marcescens.

Further, analysis of the transmission index (TI; defined as the number of salivary gland infections relative to the number of midgut infections) revealed a higher TI for slender as compared to stumpy forms under laboratory conditions, which included the addition of N-acetyl-glucosamine (NAG) to the infective bloodmeal. These findings challenge the prevailing view of the life cycle, according to which only stumpy forms are considered infective to tsetse flies. Here, we show that slender trypanosomes can infect both male and female tsetse flies, irrespective of their teneral status, in the absence of supplements in the bloodmeal. Additionally, an RNA-sequencing time course was performed on both slender and stumpy cells during their transition into procyclic forms. This analysis revealed that slender and stumpy form trypanosomes remain transcriptionally distinct throughout differentiation into the procyclic form. Furthermore, while the protein associated with differentiation 1 (PAD1) remains essential for the transition, slender cells do not require expression of other hallmark stumpy form traits, such as cell cycle arrest or the shortening of their flagella or microtubule corset. Instead, slender trypanosomes are able to transition directly into procyclic forms. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that while slender cells of T. brucei follow distinct routes to become the procyclic form, they are capable of infecting both teneral and non-teneral tsetse flies, thereby contributing to the transmission and spread of these African parasites.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

At Parc Tauli University Hospital, we identified a clinical isolate of ampicillin-susceptible E. faecium (Efm5) that exhibited unusually low-MICs to cefotaxime (1 mg/L), ceftriaxone (3 mg/L), and ceftaroline (0.19 mg/L). Upon single exposure to ceftriaxone (100 mg/L), Efm5 rapidly yielded variants with markedly increased MICs to ceftriaxone (>256 mg/L) and cefotaxime (>32 mg/L), while MICs to ampicillin and ceftaroline were unaffected. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the high-MIC variants carried single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) leading to non-synonymous mutations in croS, nusG or rpoB genes. Phenotypic assays confirmed that these mutations were associated with ceftriaxone resistance and immunoblots revealed increased expression of penicillin-binding protein 5 (PBP5) in all the high-MIC variants. Transcriptional profiling showed upregulation of the pbp5 operon, which includes ftsW, psr and pbp5, in the croS variants.

Replication checkpoint protects cells against the threat of DNA damages by suspending cell cycle, allowing DNA repair. Chk1 kinase is activated by various stresses and is required for replication checkpoint. An adaptor protein, Claspin, mediates Chk1 activation, but specific mechanisms involved are still unknown. We demonstrate that heat stress induces hyperphosphorylation of Claspin, resulting in Chk1 activation. Claspin phosphorylation is impaired in cells lacking two eIF2[alpha] kinases, GCN2 and HRI, which are parts of the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Mass spectrometry identified five heat-inducible phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal region of Claspin, and Claspin lacking these sites failed to activate checkpoint. Our data support a model that the unphosphorylated C-terminal tail of Claspin masks its CKBD (Chk1-Binding-Domain)-AP (Acidic-Patch) domain, preventing it from interacting with Cdc7. Phosphorylation of the tail causes it to dissociate from CKBD-AP and facilitates Cdc7 interaction, leading to increased Chk1 activation.

We show that loss of Spen or Nito leads to a drastic increase in E(Spl)m{gamma} expression in the stem cell and subsequent dedifferentiation of its progeny. Genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that Spen and Nito maintain the expression of E(Spl)m{gamma} in the stem cell at low levels by directly binding to two identical novel motifs in the 5'UTR to repress its translation. The low expression in the stem cell prevents excessive inheritance of E(Spl)m{gamma} proteins by the differentiating progeny and ensures its rapid removal from the progeny.

In humans the IIS axis is controlled by insulin, two Insulin like Growth Factors, two isoforms of the insulin receptor (hIRA and hIRB), and its homologous IGF1R. In Drosophila, this signalling engages seven insulin-like hormones (DILP1 to 7) and a single receptor (dmIR) that follows the blueprint of hIR/hIGF1R. This report describes two cryoEM structures of the dmIR ectodomain dmIRECD:DILP2 complex, revealing their structural homology with dmIR:DILP5 complex. The high excess of DILP2 yielded two dmIRECD complexes in asymmetric conformations, similar to that observed in some complexes of hIR and in the dmIR-ECD:DILP5 complex. This stoichiometric and structural heterogeneity, yielding one- and two-DILP2:receptor complexes were not observed in DILP5:dmIR-ECD assembly. Also, the resistance of dmIR-ECD to form more DILP2 saturated complexes, despite very high excess of this hormone, suggest that the specificities of DILPs may lie in their kon/koff kinetic parameters. This work expands understanding of the dmIR conformational flexibility, suggesting also that insect dmIR follows more hIR rather than hIGF1R receptor signal transduction pattern induced by various DILPs.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Metastasis is a highly inefficient process that is inhibited by extracellular stress. Therefore, metastasizing cells that ultimately survive and successfully colonize distant organs must undergo molecular rewiring to mitigate stress. Wobble uridine modifications, especially 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm5s2U34), have been implicated in stress response and poor prognosis of cancer patients. We use a patient derived xenograft (PDX) model of melanoma metastasis to study the role of the mcm5s2U34 modification in the stress response of metastasizing cells. We find that upon depletion of elongator acetyltransferase complex subunit 1 (ELP1) - a component of the mcm5s2U34 pathway on tRNALysUUU, tRNAGluUUC, tRNAGlnUUG, and tRNAArgUCU - codon-biased translation, migration, invasion, and metastatic burden in vivo is reduced. Further, we observe that stress granule components are enriched in a subset of codon-biased genes that are exclusively upregulated at the protein level in metastatic nodules compared to the primary tumor in our PDX model. Additionally, upon knockdown of ELP1, stress granule components have decreased protein expression with no significant change to their mRNA levels. Efficient translation, mediated by the carboxy-methylation arm of the mcm5s2U34 modification, is required for metastasizing cancer cells to withstand stress via stress granule formation and increase survival throughout the metastatic cascade.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

We generated an in vivo model of docetaxel resistance using castration-resistant patient-derived xenografts and found increased expression of genes that drive development of multiciliated cells, including FOXJ1 and its effector genes, many of which regulate ciliary microtubules (MTs). Mechanistically, FOXJ1 overexpression conferred docetaxel resistance in vitro and in vivo, which was associated with decreased docetaxel-mediated MT bundling. Overexpression of a MT-associated FOXJ1-regulated gene (TPPP3) had similar effects. Conversely, FOXJ1 knockdown impaired basal MT function, enhanced taxane binding to MTs, and increased docetaxel sensitivity. These results establish mechanistic causality between the FOXJ1 signaling axis, MT biology, and taxane resistance. Clinically, FOXJ1 gene amplification was increased in taxane-treated PC patients. Moreover, in the CHAARTED clinical trial of docetaxel combined with androgen deprivation for metastatic PC, higher baseline FOXJ1 was predictive of decreased survival in PC patients treated with docetaxel, further supporting clinical relevance.

Here we show that non-symbiotic NIN orthologs can function in intracellular infection and even nodule initiation, demonstrating that these properties of NIN predate the evolution of nodulation. Concurrent with the evolution of nodulation, symbiotic NIN proteins were optimized for their role in symbiosis by acquiring nitrate independent functionality, including constitutive nuclear localization. A single amino acid substitution in Arabidopsis AtNLP2 enhances its nuclear localization under low nitrate conditions, making it functionally comparable to a symbiotic NIN.

Here, to elucidate the regulatory architecture driving these differences, we mapped drought-responsive gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for all three species using the yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) approach. We cloned promoters of orthologs with divergent drought-induced expression patterns and screened them against the Ath transcription factor (TF) collection, generating a quality-controlled cross-species drought-responsive GRN map encompassing 1,137 high-confidence TF-promoter interactions. Comparative analysis revealed that the tolerant species share greater regulatory similarity and exhibit higher network connectivity than Ath. An Esa-specific expansion of bZIP TF interactions was observed, consistent with an enrichment of G-box motifs in its genome and in drought-upregulated genes. Several observed changes affect the ABA signalling pathway: Ath gained a susceptibility linked GBF3-CYP707A1 edge, whereas Esa acquired tolerance associated ABF-mTERF10 interactions.

Nuclear positioning in the cell is crucial during root hair development. Often, textbooks demonstrate illustrations of the nucleus located at a fixed position from the tip of a root hair or at the very end of a root hair. The fundamental question is whether the nucleus follows a cellular scale during polarized growth. Maintaining the scale is a rudimentary biological process during development at the organismal and cellular levels. In this study, we altered root hairs through hormonal, nutrient, and environmental factors to decipher the cellular scale (no scale, universal scale, or internal scale) maintained by the nucleus. We utilized the live cell imaging combined with a quantitative cell biology approach and, surprisingly discovered that the nucleus always follows an internal scale in the root hair cell. This finding dramatically shifted our view about the nuclear position in a polarized cell and will have a potential to test across the tree of life.

To overcome these challenges, we present GeneSys (Generative Modeling of Developmental System), a generative deep learning model that simulates single-cell transcriptomic landscapes under developmental constraints, which is informed by prior biological knowledge or user-defined hypotheses. GeneSys integrates a temporal variational autoencoder with a cell-type classifier, requiring a lineage blueprint as input, which enables it to model the temporal transitions of transcriptional states with cell-type specificity. Leveraging data from Arabidopsis thaliana roots and mouse embryos, we show that GeneSys learns robust developmental trajectories, generates imputed and representative transcriptomes, and enhances gene prioritization accuracy compared to unregularized scRNA-seq data. By applying gene masking and augmentation, GeneSys reveals interpretable gene expression programs (GEPs) and serves as an in silico platform to test the impact of specific genes or gene sets on user-defined developmental outcomes. Additionally, GeneSys computes linear interaction matrices (LIMAs) to infer dynamic gene networks and prioritize transcription factors with spatiotemporal resolution. These features enable GeneSys to nominate key genes governing state transitions in a developmental system, supporting both mechanistic insight and hypothesis generation.

During courtship, male Drosophilid flies produce a series of actions, including orientation, tapping, singing, licking, and copulation, that follow an ordered but temporally variable sequence [1,2]. At shorter timescales, however, individual actions remain highly dynamic. For example, courtship songs are composed of variable sequences of distinct syllables, with their patterning and amplitude actively shaped by female cues [3-5]. Leveraging recent advances in behavioral quantification [6], we discover a new courtship wing behavior that we term \"waggling\", which is present across multiple Drosophila species and characterized by rhythmic, anti-phase wing movements. We identify an intermediate level of stereotyped behavioral structure: a directional three-part motif where males and females first decelerate to near-complete stillness, followed by male-initiated waggling, which then transitions into courtship song. Wing kinematics during waggle bouts are predictive of wing choice in subsequent songs, suggesting waggling may serve as a preparatory behavior. We then focus on P1/pC1 neurons, known to promote courtship [5,7-11]. Optogenetic activation of specific P1/pC1 neuron subsets in solitary males, without any female cues, is sufficient to recapitulate the entire stillness-to-waggling-to-singing progression. These findings reveal a new layer of stereotyped structure within a flexible courtship display and demonstrate that P1/pC1 neurons can orchestrate multi-action behavioral programs through internal dynamics.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Targeted inhibition of miR-23b with anti-miR -23b in BECs enhances junction protein expression, suppresses transcellular transport, and improves barrier function via Wnt/{beta}-catenin-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In a 3D microfluidic model, anti-miR-23b accelerates vessel maturation, enhances resilience to ischemic injury, and facilitates BBB repair.

A.", "abstract": "Strategies to stimulate the regeneration of neurons in the adult central nervous system can offer universal solutions for neurodegenerative diseases. Taking lessons from naturally regenerating species, such as the zebrafish, we have previously shown that vector-mediated expression of proneural transcription factors can stimulate neurogenesis from the resident Muller glia (MG) population in the adult mouse retina, both in vitro and in vivo. To bring this closer to translation, we now show that vector-mediated expression of the proneural transcription factor ASCL1 can reprogram adult macaque MG into functional neurons. To this end, we established purified MG cultures and show they retain a mature transcriptomic profile that correlates with foveal and peripheral MG. Importantly, MG-derived neurons express retinal ganglion cell markers, can fire action potentials and have a transcriptome that overlaps with developing human and adult macaque retinal ganglion cells. To refine this approach for clinical application, we incorporated microRNA-124 target sites in the reprogramming cassette and show that this restricts expression to MG in mixed primary cultures and intact explant cultures of adult macaque retina. Regulating ASCL1 expression with microRNA-124 target sites maintained the reprogramming efficiency from adult MG cultures and improved the yield of RGC-like neurons from infant MG cultures. Most importantly, with this vector cassette we successfully reprogrammed macaque MG from both adult and infant retina into HuC/D+ neurons. Our findings demonstrate that ASCL1 can induce neurogenesis from macaque MG across ages and provide a targeted, effective strategy for potential clinical translation in retinal repair.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

It is unknown whether sensory gating, a mechanism for filtering irrelevant sensory input, is impaired during standing balance in individuals with PD. To address this, we investigated cortical sensory processing in individuals with PD, age-matched older adults (OA), and young adults (YA) as they performed four balance tasks of increasing difficulty. We measured postural sway using a force platform and recorded somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) from the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) following tibial nerve stimulation. Our results showed a clear dissociation between behavior and neurophysiology. Although postural sway was comparable between the PD and OA groups, only the OA and YA groups showed intact sensory gating, with SEP amplitudes decreasing as the balance challenge increased. In contrast, participants with PD demonstrated consistently elevated SEP amplitudes across all conditions. This study provides the first direct evidence of impaired sensory gating during standing balance in PD. These findings indicate a fundamental deficit in the cortical processing of sensory information essential for postural control. Consequently, they underscore the critical need for therapeutic interventions that target sensory integration deficits, not just motor symptoms.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

However, current pain therapies are often ineffective, raising the possibility that novel disease mediators might be contributing to pain during inflammation. Our study provides new insights into how matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are elevated in IBD, stimulate sensory neurons. We demonstrate that MMP3, MMP8, and MMP9 induce intracellular Ca2+ release in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons through activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) and subsequent activation of phospholipase C (PLC). Characterisation of the neuronal populations stimulated by these MMPs suggests that a subset is likely nociceptive. In contrast, MMP2 and MMP13, although capable of cleaving PAR1 in other cell types, do not induce Ca2+ mobilisation in DRG neurons. Interestingly, pre-treatment with MMP2 or MMP13 reduces the neuronal response to MMP3 or PAR1 agonist, suggesting that MMP2 and MMP13 act on PAR1 in a manner which prevents further activation. Additionally, MMP10 induces Ca2+ mobilisation in DRG neurons but through a PAR1-independent mechanism. These findings uncover a previously unrecognised role for MMP signalling in sensory neurons, highlighting a potential mechanism by which MMPs could contribute to the pro-nociceptive environment in the inflamed bowel.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

While multiple immune subsets contribute to plaque progression and instability, the role of {gamma}{delta} T cells remains poorly understood. We examined the contribution of {gamma}{delta} T cells to lesion development, progression and instability, and explored the therapeutic potential of their pharmacological blockade. Methods: To investigate the role of {gamma}{delta} T cells, chimeric atherosclerosis-prone mice lacking {gamma}{delta} T cells were utilized in both loss- and gain-of-function experiments. Mixed bone marrow chimeras were generated to assess the role of {gamma}{delta} T cell-derived interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}) and perforin (Pfp). The therapeutic efficacy of AMG487 on plaque stability was evaluated in a preclinical tandem-stenosis mouse model. Lesion size, plaque composition, and stability were assessed using histology, immunoassays, and molecular biology techniques. Results: CD27+ {gamma}{delta} T cells accumulated in atherosclerotic lesions and promoted plaque progression and instability via IFN-{gamma}- and Pfp-dependent manners. As early infiltrators, they amplified necrosis and inflammation by enhancing immune cell recruitment, thereby exacerbating lesion vulnerability. CXCR3 antagonism with AMG487 inhibited {gamma}{delta} T cell recruitment to plaques, reduced lesion size, and promoted features of plaque stability, including increased smooth muscle cell content and thicker fibrous caps. Conclusions: CD27+ {gamma}{delta} T cells, which promote inflammation and necrosis through both direct and indirect mechanisms, are key drivers of plaque progression and instability. Targeting their recruitment via CXCR3 blockade enhances plaque stability and may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

To study adaptation in the industrially and ecologically important bacterium Streptomyces, a long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) was undertaken in a strain lacking several antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), facilitating the study of epistasis in antibiotic biosynthesis. Streptomyces coelicolor is a filamentous soil organism that does not undergo sporulation under the LTEE conditions, affording the opportunity to study adaptation under relaxed selection on sporulation. Replicate populations showed parallel loss of sporulation and major morphological shifts in terms of hyphal growth and aggregate formation, where fragmenting hyphae became the dominant phenotype. Catabolic diversification was also evident across the replicate populations with extensive growth rate changes relative to the progenitor across several nutrient sources, where there is evidence for both antagonistic pleiotropy and mutation accumulation. Negative epistasis was predominant in antibiotic biosynthesis in strains from the LTEE. This system provides a foundation for studying diversification and adaption to a novel environment in a physiologically and morphologically complex organism.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify the proton-driven Solute carrier 11A2 (Slc11A2) or divalent metal transport protein Dmt1 as an inhibitor of Notch signaling via regulating iron homeostasis and lysosomal integrity. Dmt1 loss reduces ferritin levels and increases labile Fe2+, causing elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. These changes compromise lysosomal function and impair degradation of S3-Val1744 cleaved NICD1, resulting in its accumulation. Dmt1 has isoforms with or without an iron response element (IRE): Re-expressing Dmt1+IRE robustly increases ferritin heavy-chain (FTH), whereas Dmt1-IRE moderately elevates FTH and ferritin light-chain (FTL), with co-expression further enhancing FTL levels. Restoration of Dmt1 expression rescues ferritin levels, lysosomal activity, and NICD1 degradation while reducing oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation. Notably, Dmt1 deficiency decreases NICD1 binding to RBP-J{kappa}/CSL and its recruitment to Notch target gene promoters Hes1 and Hey1. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that Dmt1 regulates lysosomal function through iron homeostasis and that lysosomal dysfunction from Dmt1 loss impairs NICD1 degradation and disrupts Notch signaling, linking cellular iron metabolism and Notch pathway activity.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Haploinsufficiency of C9orf72, the most common genetic cause of ALS and FTD, has been mainly linked to autophagy-lysosomal pathway defects, but its precise role in microglial lysosomal function remains unclear. Here we identify the C9orf72/SMCR8 complex as a key regulator of microglial homeostasis through lysosomal repair. Loss of C9orf72 and SMCR8 in mice causes age-dependent neuroinflammation and microgliosis, with microglia adopting a disease-associated state. In aged CNS tissue, microglia display lysosomal damage, marked by galectin-3 upregulation and its accumulation on lysosomes. To model this process, we applied the lysosomotropic agent LLOMe to microglia, which recapitulated lysosomal damage and revealed defective recruitment of phosphorylated RAB8A and the ESCRT machinery in C9orf72/SMCR8-deficient cells. Notably, mutant microglia accumulate GTP?bound RAB8A, which becomes aberrantly hyperphosphorylated and mislocalized to non-lysosomal vesicles. We further show that the GAP activity of the C9orf72/SMCR8 complex is essential for lysosomal repair. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized role for the C9orf72/SMCR8 complex in coordinating RAB8A-ESCRT-mediated lysosomal repair, thereby safeguarding microglial homeostasis and limiting neuroinflammation.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Because both environmental factors (temperature, salinity) and demographics (age, sex) influence health and disease risk, understanding these relationships is essential for effective management. Direct health assessments are challenging in cetaceans, but skin lesions can indicate active infection and tooth-rake marks reflect social stressors that increase transmission risk. Yet, traditional photographic analysis of these indicators is inefficient, creating processing bottlenecks that limit timely evaluation of population health. To address this gap, we applied machine learning to rapidly assess lesions and rake marks in Tamanends bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops erebennus) photographed in the Chesapeake Bay, a known hotspot for disease-related die-offs. This represents the first analysis of environmental and demographic contributions to dolphin health in this region. We found significant negative relationships between lesion prevalence and both temperature and salinity for some lesion types. Adult males also showed higher rake mark coverage than adult females and calves. These patterns suggest dolphins in colder, fresher waters may face elevated disease risk, while adult males may be particularly vulnerable to behavioral stress and related health consequences. Our findings are consistent with prior studies, lending validity to our machine learning models, while also revealing novel patterns of calf and male vulnerability in this threatened population.

Moreover, studies focus on individual components of RS such as intake or reward discrimination or relative valuation. Pinpointing how consistent or variable these distinct components of RS are would be highly beneficial, so we tested identical subjects between two well-established contexts (home cage and operant chamber) using identical sucrose solutions to assess key elements of RS (e.g., intake and reward discrimination and incentive contrast). Previous work has found context invariance for specific components of RS and consistency across contexts could be highly adaptive. Interestingly, the current study found significant discrimination and contrast effects in the home environment and reduced or weaker effects in the operant testing chamber environment. Negative contrast effect was observed only in the homecage and not in the operant chamber. Surprisingly, relative to home, rats consumed significantly more sucrose in the operant box for 1% and 10% but not 30% sucrose. The results support a substantial environmental gating influence whereby context may work to induce alterations in reward value. Contextual factors such as arousal, stress or effort could influence the intensity or expression of RS. Careful consideration to context is highly warranted when generalizing reward processing functions among distinct environmental-experimental settings.

Here, we used a mouse model of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibition, the Ptgs2-Y385F mouse, to identify effects of the NSAID naproxen on bone that are independent of or dependent on COX2 activity. We hypothesized that naproxen would decrease strain adaptive bone remodeling in a COX2-dependent manner, but would decrease bone toughness and fracture resistance through COX2-independent effects. We first used microCT analysis and mechanical testing to compare bones from Ptgs2-Y385F mice to those of wild type (WT) littermates, revealing few skeletal differences due to the genetic mutation. Next, WT and Ptgs2-Y385F mice were subjected to six bouts of non-damaging uniaxial forelimb compression over two weeks while receiving vehicle or naproxen drinking water. Here, naproxen decreased load-induced bone formation in WT, but not Ptgs2-Y385F mice, indicating a COX2-dependent effect. Contrastingly, naproxen reduced bone toughness and post-yield deformation across genotypes compared to vehicle treatment, supporting a COX2-independent mechanism influencing fracture resistance. The effects of naproxen were consistent across different doses and were not dose-dependent within the administered range. Additionally, histological analysis showed that naproxen, compared to vehicle treatment, increased empty osteocyte lacunae number across genotypes while increasing osteoblast number, total osteocyte lacunae number, and fluorophore perilacunar labeling in WT mice only. These findings suggest that naproxen acts on bone cells through both COX2-independent and -dependent mechanisms. Separately, mice were also pre-treated with vehicle or naproxen for 15 days before fatigue fracture induction by axial forelimb compression, then received further treatment for 15 days as limbs healed. Naproxen treatment resulted in mild, but sex-specific, effects on fracture formation and healing in both genotypes compared to vehicle. Further analysis of osteocyte dendritic networks in uninjured femurs from these same mice also revealed sexually dimorphic changes in dendrite number and density in naproxen treated mice as compared to vehicle, correlating with previously observed bone toughness differences. Together, these results demonstrate that naproxen influences bone through both COX2-dependent and -independent mechanisms and displays sex-dependent differences. These findings also suggest that regular COX2-selective NSAID use can have skeletal consequences, thus safe pain management methods for individuals with higher fracture risk must be identified.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Using an integrated multi-omics approach centered on paired mass distance (PMD) reactomics, we show that redox cycling increased the removal of 32 diverse OMPs from a baseline of 32% up to 67%. This enhancement was driven by a complete restructuring of degradation mechanisms: cycling stimulated microbial amino acid and fatty acid metabolism by up to 42%, which coupled to controlled ROS production where oxidative pathways (+15.995 Da) accounted for 47% of transformations under intermittent aeration. We mapped distinct enzymatic fingerprints, with strong correlations (r > 0.7) linking Proteobacteria monooxygenases to oxidative reactions and Rhodobacteraceae dehydrogenases to reductive ones (+2.016 Da), revealing clear functional specialization.

Structural modeling showed that BX-912 binds the Orange domain of HES1, while its WRPW motif mediates interactions with protein partners, including the AP2 endocytic protein complex, coordinating their nuclear accumulation that leads to a mitotic catastrophe. Furthermore, cell cycle analyses showed that BX-912 combined with olaparib synergistically enhanced DNA damage and G2-M arrest. Our study demonstrates the value of proteomics for revealing hidden drug activities. It also identifies potential inhibition strategies for HES1, which is commonly overexpressed in HGSC. Additionally, this study proposes a novel strategy of targeting consecutive cell cycle phases to enhance treatment efficacy in HGSC.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

C.; Liu, Y.; Eliceiri, K. W.; Witzenburg, C.

Unlike early reperfusion therapy, differences in infarct size or collagen content have not been reported in late reperfusion therapy. To evaluate the spatial-temporal effects of late reperfusion therapy, we conducted multimodal imaging of histologic sections of rat myocardium following permanent coronary artery occlusion or three hours of occlusion. Semi-automatic partitioning identified the infarct core, infarct border, and healthy periphery regions from label-free liquid crystal based polarized light microscopy (PolScope) images taken throughout the first 5 days of healing. Associated brightfield and standard polarized light microscopy images of hematoxylin-eosin or Picrosirius Red stained sections were also used to determine cellular and collagen fiber densities, respectively. Even when we consider multiple definitions for the vulnerable infarct border, its size decreased faster in late reperfusion therapy samples. Temporal patterns in collagen density also indicated late reperfusion led to a more rapid progression through the necrotic phase of healing (when the infarct is vulnerable to rupture) and earlier progression to the fibrotic phase of healing (when the infarct stabilizes). Notably, we also observed a broader region of provisional non-collagenous matrix in late reperfusion samples during the necrotic phase of healing. Together these findings suggest late reperfusion therapy accelerates healing and potentially changes the spatial pattern of provisional matrix deposition during the period the heart is most susceptible to rupture events.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

However, interventions that increase lifespan can result from suppression of one or more individual late-life pathologies. Here we show how, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, such pathologies can compete in a hierarchical fashion to cause death, such that removal of one cause of death can unmask another. Under standard culture conditions, a major cause of death in elderly C. elegans is infection by their bacterial food source. We report that only when such infection is prevented is lifespan extended by suppression of a second senescent pathology, teratoma-like uterine tumors. Thus, as in mammals, lifespan in wild-type C. elegans can be limited by naturally-occurring neoplasia. By contrast, blocking bacterial infection attenuated the life-shortening effects of vitellogenesis, and did not unmask a life-shortening effect of distal gonad degeneration. Thus, depending on the masking or unmasking of competing causes of mortality in the hierarchy of causes of death, nematode lifespan limitation in different contexts can reflect action of distinct life-limiting senescent pathologies. This underscores how increases in lifespan do not necessarily reflect a reduction in overall aging rate.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

With computational tools we correlated the experimentally observed reactivities with steric and electronic factors of the investigated warheads. QM/MM simulations considering the enzymatic environment explained how substitution of carbon for nitrogen in the leaving groups of compounds 26 and 28 through resonance stabilisation, inductive bond polarization, and acidity amplification lowered the reaction barrier and increased the reaction rate >360 million times, making compound 28 a covalent inhibitor. Our findings underline the complexity of covalent inhibition and demonstrate that multiple complementary methods are required to interpret and predict covalent behaviour. Additionally, even though carbamates typically act as slow substrates, we were able to slow down decarbamoylation to a point where inhibition became de facto irreversible. The most interesting O-isoxazol-3-yl carbamate warhead was further profiled against the wider human proteome and showed low off-target reactivity, making it useful in further drug discovery.

Here, we report the development and mechanism of ACTIVATE (Adoptive Cell Therapy and Immunostimulatory Vehicle for Anti-Tumor Efficacy), which leverages an injectable hydrogel depot technology that forms a transient inflammatory niche for localized co-delivery of adoptive T cells and native cytokines. By tuning cytokine identity, ACTIVATE enables precise modulation of T-cell expansion, effector function, and interaction with endogenous immune networks. We found that enhancing T-cell proliferation alone is insufficient to drive robust tumor control; instead, coordinated engagement of both adoptive and endogenous immune responses is critical for durable anti-tumor efficacy. In vivo, this orchestration via ACTIVATE led to enhanced infiltration and cytotoxicity of both adoptive and host-derived immune effectors, while driving robust recruitment and activation of T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages in the tumor-draining lymph nodes. This local immune activation can further reshape the TME, promoting antigen presentation and suppressing immunoregulatory populations, thus enhancing anti-tumor efficacy in a murine melanoma model.

The therapeutic efficacy of the KD is largely attributed to ketone bodies, {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB), and acetoacetate. GPR109A, the receptor for {beta}HB, has been shown to regulate immune responses, but its role in metabolism remains unclear. This study investigated the role of GPR109A in lipid metabolism under specific ketogenic conditions, such as fasting and KD feeding. Gpr109a-/- mice exhibited increased hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, and fibrosis after being fed the KD, indicating that GPR109A, highly expressed in macrophages, modulates macrophage-driven inflammation and thus has a protective role in the liver. In contrast, GPR109A did not contribute to hepatic protection during short-term fasting, suggesting that its role is more pronounced under specific ketogenic conditions. Further analysis of this mechanism revealed that GPR109A protects the liver from inflammation by maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and limiting lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leakage from the gut under diet-induced ketogenic conditions. These findings highlight the novel protective mechanism of GPR109A, via the gut-liver axis, to sustain metabolic homeostasis during the KD.

However, the molecular mechanisms driving sarcopenia in ESLD are not fully understood and there are currently no therapeutic interventions. This study aimed to identify potential circulating factors contributing to sarcopenia progression in ESLD by assessing their role in driving transcriptomic alterations in skeletal muscle. Methods: Quadriceps muscle tissue, plasma and serum were obtained from ESLD patients (n=24) and age/sex-matched healthy controls (HC; n=18) (clinical trial ID: NCT04734496, ethical approval 18/WM/0167). Total RNA from snap-frozen vastus lateralis muscle biopsies underwent RNA sequencing (Illumina). Serum concentrations of 60 cytokines were profiled by Luminex and ELISA, with comparisons made both between ESLD and HC, and across ESLD aetiologies (alcohol-related, NAFLD, viral hepatitis, other). In vitro, primary human myotubes (from non-ESLD aged donors, NRES #16/SS/0172) were treated with 10% ESLD or HC plasma (24 h, n=6 per group) followed by RNA sequencing (BGI Genomics). Differentially expressed genes (p<0.05, fold-change >1.5) were identified via Qlucore and DESeq2, and pathway analysis performed using Ingenuity (Qiagen). The impact of physiological concentrations of candidate cytokines (IL-1, GDF-15, HGF) on myotube thickness, differentiation and mitochondrial function was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy, RT-qPCR and metabolic flux assays. Results: In ESLD muscle, 387 and 225 genes were significantly up- and downregulated compared to HC respectively, with cellular senescence identified as a top dysregulated function. Upstream regulator analysis predicted activation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and interleukin-1 signalling. Subgroup analysis revealed distinct transcriptomic profiles based on disease aetiology. Serum profiling identified 15 cytokines significantly elevated (p<0.05) and 5 reduced (p<0.05) in ESLD, including increased HGF and reduced interleukin-1 receptor antagonist. Stratified analysis also revealed aetiology specific cytokine profiles, with only GDF-15 significantly (P<0.0001) elevated in all groups. 24h ESLD plasma treatment induced 423 differentially expressed genes in human myotubes, which were again associated with significant activation of senescence pathways, with IL-1 identified as a key upstream driver. In vitro, IL-1, GDF-15, and HGF significantly reduced myotube thickness, nuclear fusion index and perturbed metabolism (Increased glycolysis, impaired oxidative phosphorylation). Conclusions: Collectively, these findings suggest that sarcopenia in ESLD is driven by aetiology-specific mechanisms, highlighting the potential for targeted therapies to improve muscle mass and function.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

The initial loss of rods is followed by a secondary cone photoreceptor degeneration and eventually legal blindness. Despite several attempts, RP still remains essentially untreatable. In recent years, inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy of autosomal-recessive RP, based on promising work in preclinical animal models. However, the effects of PARP inhibitors in autosomal-dominant RP are still largely unknown. Here, we employed a novel, human-homologous rhodopsin-mutant RhoI255del/+ mouse model for autosomal dominant RP to assess the impact of different PARP inhibitors on the progression of photoreceptor degeneration. The PARP inhibitors used--olaparib, saruparib, INO1001, and nicotinamide--target different PARP isoforms, and their potentially differential effects were evaluated in organotypic retinal explants cultivated under entirely defined conditions. Readouts comprised in situ activity assays for PARP and calpain-type proteases, the TUNEL assay for cell death, as well as immunostaining for activated calpain-2, activated caspase-3, rhodopsin, and cone arrestin-3. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to previous findings in animal models for recessive RP, all of the included PARP inhibitors led to a marked and dose-dependent rod photoreceptor toxicity in the RhoI255del model for dominant RP. Furthermore, this effect appeared to be independent of rhodopsin expression. On the other hand, both cone photoreceptors and inner retinal neurons were apparently unaffected by PARP inhibition. The present study thus demonstrates the importance of PARP activity for rod photoreceptor viability in a dominant rhodopsin mutant, highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying photoreceptor degeneration in different RP forms, and cautions against the indiscriminate use of PARP inhibitors for the treatment of RP.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we functionalized alginates and obtained PCa-specific hydrogels for 3D culture and ease evaluation of markers used to assess PCa progression in human prostate cancer cells (i.e., PC-3 cells). Alginate-based hydrogels were modified with laminin-like peptides (i.e., IKVAV, AG73) and tailored in physical and mechanical properties to closely mimic the PCa ECM, with mechanical properties in the range of 2.5-13 kPa (the stiffer value matching advanced/metastatic PCa).

F.", "abstract": "Phase synchronized population dynamics of various species constituting a complex ecosystem elevates the risk of their extinction due to both environmental stochasticity and simultaneous low density fluctuations. Therefore, an extremely efficient approach to measure the extinction risk of an ecosystem as a whole is to quantify the phase synchrony among the co-habiting species populations. Generally, in models describing population dynamics of ecosystems, both trophic and non-trophic inter-species interactions are classified as two-species interactions. This approach contradicts the fact that several species living in close proximity must partake in the same interaction, influencing the population dynamics of each other. To address this, higher-order interactions need to be incorporated in the models describing population dynamics of an ecosystem and their effect on phase synchronization of populations need to be investigated. In this study, we model a species-rich ecosystem as a multi-node complex ecological network and examine the phase dynamics of the total species population. Each node of this network represents a constituent species, modelled as a Sakugachi-Kuramoto phase oscillator coupled non-linearly to the other nodes through both first-order and higher-order inter-species interactions. These interactions can be both commensalist/mutualist (positive) and antagonistic (negative) in nature. Along with the higher order interactions, we also incorporate inherent asymmetry among the nodes to account for habitat heterogeneity. We investigate the effects of both higher-order coupling and asymmetry on the phase synchronization of the ecological network as a whole. Our findings demonstrate that higher-order interactions above a threshold amplitude result in a transition from synchronous to asynchronous dynamics of the ecosystem. Further, we find that increase in the size and diversity of the ecosystem lead to increased threshold higher order coupling required to reach asynchronous dynamics, though eventually it happens. We also demonstrate that the asynchrony in dynamics induced by higher-order interactions, is further promoted by high asymmetry among the individual nodes. Notably, negative inter-species interactions, if existing to a high degree also induce asynchrony in the system. However, the size of the network also plays a role in deciding the threshold value of higher order coupling required to induce asynchrony.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Many factors can be at play, potentially acting in contrasting directions and with heterogeneous effects through space. With an Ecological Niche Modelling approach, we predicted the invasion risks of Peters's Rock Agama Agama picticauda, a species that is spreading globally in non-forested areas through freight transport and un-intentional releases from the pet trade. The potential establishment of the species in new areas is of concern for multiple endemic species throughout the world. We quantified the effects of climate, anthropogenic activity and forest cover on invasion risk. We used verified records from the native and non-native range and accounted for the latest methodological recommendations. We predicted how invasion risk will vary in the future (2070) using projections from two scenarios (SSP2 and SSP5). We predict that invasion risks will vary in diverging directions, depending on the region. The risk will increase in human-populated regions and on small islands but will decrease in Florida. We recommend increasing surveillance in vehicular transportation of material especially within the Comoros and the Mascarenes archipelagos. Since many introductions are related to the pet trade in Florida, we recommend stronger legal regulations and the promotion of public awareness. Promoting tree cover may be locally beneficial to prevent establishment of A. picticauda. The effect of climate change, land use change and human activities may differ between and within both, the native and the invaded regions.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

The first mathematical model was proposed by Francis Crick over 50 years ago by postulating a reaction-diffusion based mechanism underlying the whole process. The first real world morphogen, named Bicoid (Bcd), was identified by molecular biologists in late 1980s in the embryo of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Subsequently, Crick classical random walk based model was used by biophysicists to explain the formation of Bicoid and other morphogen gradients. Very recently Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies have revealed multiple modes of Bcd transport at different spatial and temporal locations across the embryo of Drosophila melanogaster. It has been be shown that these observations are best fitted by a model based on quantum mechanics. In such a model it is hypothesized that the transitory quantum coherences in collaboration with unitary noise are responsible for the observed dynamics and relaxation to a non-equilibrium steady-state of the Bcd morphogen gradient. In this article, in addition to further clarifying the mathematical details underlying the quantum-classical model, we use the said model to explain the observed Bcd interpretation time by its primary target gene Hunchback (hb).", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

The orientation of ciliary beating largely depends on the rotational polarity of the basal body, which in most animals is fixed and controlled by cues linked to the main body axes. The small marine animal Trichoplax exploits the beating of motile cilia in its lower epithelium to crawl on substrates. However, Trichoplax lacks defined body axes and exhibits rapid changes in body shape and direction of movement, thus raising the question of what controls the orientation and reorientation of ciliary beating. We show here that the basal bodies of the cilia in the lower epithelium of Trichoplax are oriented along the direction of the animal movements, and that they change their orientation throughout the lower epithelium in a few seconds time when the animal modifies its shape or changes direction following external mechanical stimuli. We also show that Ca2+ is required for fast basal body reorientation. Such rapid ciliary basal body reorientation has never been observed in metazoans before. Thus, our results identify a previously undescribed mechanism underlying directional motility in a metazoan and shed light on its subcellular determinants, bridging the scale between intra-cellular ciliary machinery and animal movement.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Using Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we dissected the mechanisms by which quiescent cells maintain genome stability in the absence of DNA replication. Combining time-resolved mutational analyses, DNA damage assays, and genetic dissection of DNA repair pathways, we found that quiescent cells progressively accumulate distinct types of spontaneous lesions-particularly uracil residues, abasic sites, and ribonucleotide insertions-which are counteracted by a modular network of repair mechanisms. Base excision repair (BER), ribonucleotide excision repair (RER), and R-loop resolution each contribute uniquely to genome surveillance in G0. We show that uracil incorporation becomes a predominant threat under quiescent conditions, especially when nucleotide pools are imbalanced. BER-deficient mutants (e.g., nth1{Delta}, ung1{Delta}) exhibit mutation spectra dominated by C: G > T: A transitions and oxidative lesions, while synthetic combinations reveal compensatory or epistatic interactions. Using single-cell micromanipulation and viability assays, we show that specific gene deletions (e.g., hnt3{Delta}rhp52{Delta}, sen1{Delta}rad13{Delta}) severely compromise post-quiescence recovery, underscoring the importance of cooperative DNA repair even in non-replicative contexts.

Here, we report the characterization of a novel cross talk mechanism by which CDK1 and Aurora B (AURKB) kinases regulate the distribution and interactions of Citron kinase (CIT-K). We show that CDK1 and AURKB phosphorylate two distinct serine residues, S440 and S699, located adjacent to or within the coiled coil domain of CIT-K. S440 and S699 temporal phosphorylation profiles reflect the activity of the kinases responsible for their phosphorylation. Functional analyses using phospho mutants indicate that S699 phosphorylation is important for CIT-K localization and successful cytokinesis, while perturbing S440 phosphorylation leads to abnormal midbody formation and accumulation of post-mitotic midbody remnants (MBRs). Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation at either residue reduces the ability of CIT-K to interact with its midbody partners AURKB, KIF14 and KIF23/MKLP1. Together, our findings indicate that coordinated phosphorylation of CIT-K by CDK1 and AURKB regulates midbody formation and MBR stability by controlling the association of CIT-K with its midbody partners. They expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate abscission and can lead to further insights into the role of MBRs in post-mitotic events.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

How the nucleus reacts to these mechanical cues, ensuring a tight balance between mechano-protection and mechanotransduction is a key yet unresolved question. Here we show that the transcriptional response to mechanical cues is spatially restricted during EMT. Using Drosophila mesoderm invagination as an integrated model of EMT, we quantified single nuclei deformation, nuclear envelope biophysical properties and transcriptional responses during EMT. We found that two conserved pro-EMT genes, snail (sna) and twist (twi), respond differently to forces. We show that twi (but not snail) transcription is enhanced in deformed nuclei, and micromanipulations via optical tweezers is sufficient to rapidly activate twi transcription in vivo. We further reveal the genome wide response to EMT mechanical forces. Surprisingly mechanosensitive genes seem to be polarized along the nuclear apico-basal axis, revealing a mechanoprotective apical nuclear environment. Direct manipulations of the nuclear envelope in living embryos prove sufficient to induce an immediate transcriptional response, but solely when applied to basal nuclear regions.

This parasite employs a subset of trypanosome-specific nucleus- and spindle-associated proteins (NuSAPs) to regulate mitosis, but the mechanistic roles of these proteins remain poorly understood. Here, we performed biochemical and molecular characterization of NuSAP1 and analyzed the functional interplay of NuSAP1 with its interacting and proximal proteins. NuSAP1 localizes to the mitotic spindle with spindle pole enrichment, and interacts with the spindle-associated and spindle pole-enriched proteins NuSAP4 and SPB1 through distinct structural motifs. NuSAP1 and NuSAP4 are interdependent for protein stability, and NuSAP1 is required for SPB1 localization. Further, NuSAP1 bundles microtubules in vitro, and depletion of NuSAP1 disrupts bipolar spindle assembly. Finally, knockdown of NuSAP1 disrupts the localization of its proximal proteins MAP103 and TbMlp2 to spindle poles.

Highly active chromosome regions which weakly associate with NS instead show close, NS-independent association with these perispeckle patterns. Additionally, transcripts from model intron-containing versus intronless genes associate differentially with these two patterns.

By integrating graph neural networks with contrastive learning in a self-supervised framework, STARNet learns unified embeddings that preserve both multi-modal molecular features and anatomical spatial context, enabling accurate and domain-resolved GRN reconstruction within complex tissues. Benchmarking on both simulated and real datasets demonstrates that STARNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate its broad applicability across diverse biological contexts, including neural development, genetic disease risk, and drug-induced developmental toxicity. In the mouse brain, it delineates region-specific regulatory networks and reconstructs spatiotemporal programs underlying neural stem cell differentiation. In human genetics, it provides a mechanistic link between genotypes and phenotypes by showing how genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for complex diseases perturb hippocampus-specific GRNs. In developmental toxicology, STARNet reveals that drug-induced disruptions of GRNs in defined embryonic regions underlie tissue-specific vulnerability.

Here, I present evidence that ecDNA tethering to chromosomes is coupled to chromatin compaction during mitotic chromosome formation, which acts to generally increase chromatin-chromatin interaction. Using a cancer cell line model, I show that decompacting mitotic chromatin under hypotonic conditions and by increasing histone acetylation untethers ecDNA from chromosomes, leading to their mis-segregation into micronuclei after mitosis. Additionally, overexpression of the mitotic chromosome surfactant Ki67 untethers ecDNA from chromosomes, leading to their mis-segregation into micronuclei.

Larger female flight muscles develop from more myoblasts than in males, while cardiomyocyte numbers are the same despite forming a larger heart in females.

Given the critical role of PD-related activating mutations in LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat protein kinase 2) within membrane trafficking pathways we examined the impact of mutant LRRK2G2019S on iron homeostasis within a model macrophage cell line known to have high iron capacity. Proteomics analysis revealed a dysregulation of iron-related proteins in steady state with highly elevated levels of ferritin light chain and a reduction of ferritin heavy chain. LRRK2 mutant cells showed efficient ferritinophagy upon iron chelation, but upon iron overload there was a near complete block in the degradation of the ferritinophagy adaptor NCOA4. Surprisingly, NCOA4 levels were not rescued upon inhibition of the LRRK2 kinase activity in iron overload conditions, nor was the phosphorylation of substrate Rab GTPases. We therefore generated a CRISPR mutation to delete the kinase domain of LRRK2 and express only the Rab-binding armadillo repeat domain. Although the kinase domain was deleted, the truncation mutant of LRRK2 showed strong Rab8 phosphorylation in conditions of iron overload, similar to LRRK2G2019S cells, with the phosphorylated Rab8 accumulating at the plasma membrane. These data indicate that the G2019S mutation acts as a kinase independent, dominant-interfering mutant specifically in conditions of iron overload.

Chaotic fluctuations in population, barring a very few specific conditions, have generally been established to be more prone to extinction through cascading effects, environmental noise, and regular occurrence of low species density. Thus, chaotic population dynamics has been largely associated with low persistence in ecosystems. Contrastingly, ecosystems with steady-state dynamics have been established to be extremely stable. Nevertheless, the continued existence of chaotic ecosystems have been suggested to be a result of internal and external control of chaos engineered by either the ecosystems themselves, or some external factor. However, the question of chaos control, specifically, the quenching of chaos in metacommunities arising due to internal ecological feature like habitat heterogeneity has not been investigated. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of a metacommunity of ecosystems, where one patch is the drive, and the other patches are responses. Each patch consists of an inherently chaotic tritrophic food web, with habitat heterogeneity among themselves. We report that in a drive-response metacommunity, dynamical chaos in both drive and response patches is quenched under a strong influence of the drive, subsequently leading to steady states in most cases. We report the occurrence of this phenomenon for 2 metacommunity network structures. We discover that the heterogeneity of the response systems and the dissimilarity of the drive and response systems play a major role in quenching the chaos. Thus, it is extremely possible that the existence of an inherently chaotic metacommunity is strongly an interplay of chaos, habitat heterogeneity, and the structure of the network created by dispersal. Notably, metacommunities consisting of inherent chaotic patches also face the risk of extinction due to dispersal-induced synchronization. Therefore, we have investigated dispersal-induced complete synchronization between the constituent patches of these drive-response metacommunity.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Metformin-treated mice also show decreased neuroinflammation with reduced levels of astrogliosis and reduced numbers of activated microglia. Taken together, these data provide strong support for testing FDA-approved metformin in clinical trials for SCA8 and potentially the broader group of CAG*CTG repeat expansion disorders.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

A key translational challenge to wider adoption is understanding and mitigating long-term neural signal variability. This study evaluated whether correlation-based features of electrocorticographic (ECoG) high-gamma signals (HG-C) provide greater long-term stability and robustness than high-gamma log-power (HGLP) features for neural voice activity detection (NVAD). We analyzed an open-source dataset from Angrick et al. [1] of an individual with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis performing a syllable repetition task. Long short-term memory (LSTM) models were trained on HGLP or HG-C features and evaluated across sessions separated from training by up to six months. Feature importance was estimated with permutation-based marginal effects analysis and robustness was tested by simulated electrode disconnections. HG-C achieved comparable to superior NVAD performance, with reduced temporal degradation (-8% vs. -23% F1 score decline). HG-C models leveraged distributed correlation structure and remained stable under both random and systematic electrode disconnections.

We previously reported that high-concentration trehalose induces a transient senescent-like state in fibroblasts, leading to cell cycle arrest and growth factor secretion via CDKN1A/p21, and this process promoted keratinocyte proliferation, enhancing capillary formation and wound closure in vivo. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of trehalose on human keratinocytes. Methods: Previously published RNA-seq data of cytokine-untreated samples from our group of trehalose-treated human keratinocytes were re-analyzed, and an in vitro scratch assay was performed using cells treated with mitomycin C. Results: The trehalose-treated group exhibited increased wound closure. A significantly increased secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was observed in keratinocytes treated with high-concentration trehalose, which is one of the most crucial molecules inducing angiogenesis in the skin. Significant upregulation of mRNA level and protein secretion of VEGF was confirmed using qPCR and ELISA, respectively. Furthermore, treatment with axitinib, a VEGF receptor inhibitor, significantly suppressed trehalose-induced activation of keratinocyte migration. Additionally, the increase in trehalose-induced migration activity was significantly inhibited by the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125 and the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Conclusion: Trehalose promotes wound healing via VEGF secretion from keratinocytes and the PI3K and JNK pathways. The findings of this study may lead to the development of novel therapeutic agents that can alter the wound healing process.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

B.; Abel, M. G.; Eisman, R. C.; Weaver, L. N.", "abstract": "Tissue homeostasis is dependent on precise coordination between endocrine organs in response to changes in organism physiology. Secreted circulating factors from adipocytes (called adipokines) regulate the behavior of stem cell lineages in peripheral tissues in multiple organisms. In addition to their endocrine roles, Drosophila adipocytes store and secrete amino acid storage proteins throughout development. During the larval feeding period, adipocytes secrete storage proteins into the hemolymph, which are reabsorbed by the adipose tissue during metamorphosis to control adult organ size and fertility. Despite the known functions for storage proteins during the larval stages, their requirement during Drosophila adulthood and reproduction are uncharacterized. We discover that adipocyte-specific knockdown of the storage proteins Larval serum protein 1 (Lsp1) alpha/beta/gamma and Larval serum protein 2 (Lsp2) results in a decrease in GSC maintenance. We further reveal that decreased GSC number is due to downregulation of Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling in GSCs, suggesting compromised amino acid sensing directly in GSCs. We also find that the proteins that mediate storage protein adipocyte reabsorption, Fat body protein 1 (Fbp1) and Fat body protein 2 (Fbp2), are expressed in ovarian follicle cells. Intriguingly, Fbp1 nor Fbp2 appear to be required in follicle cells for GSC maintenance, suggesting undiscovered requirements for amino acid storage proteins in oogenesis.

Recent studies have shown that BAT development and function are under epigenetic control, with DNA methylation linked to the regulation of key thermogenic and metabolic genes. Here we sought to understand how diet and cold exposure interactively shape BAT gene regulation controlled by DNA methylation. Mice (N = 8 per group) were housed under cold exposure (8 C) or thermoneutrality (30 C) and fed either chow or high-fat diet (HFD). BAT was isolated for transcriptome (RNAseq) and methylome (RRBS) analyses. We identified differentially methylated and expressed genes (DMEGs) by comparing the effects of cold exposure under chow and high-fat diet, as well as by analyzing the interaction between temperature and diet. Functional pathway enrichment and EpiFactors Database screening were used to assess epigenetic regulators, and candidate gene expression was validated by modulating DNA methylation in vitro. We identified ~1,360 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) uniquely affected by the diet-temperature interaction with most downregulated in HFD-fed mice, indicating that obesity limits the transcriptional response of BAT to cold. 65 DMEGs (4% of DEGs) were largely diet-specific in response to cold exposure, suggesting that DNA methylation contributes to a selective layer of gene regulation during BAT adaptation to distinct metabolic states. In HFD-fed mice, DMEGs were enriched in pathways related to mitochondrial dysfunction, altered lipid metabolism, neuroendocrine signaling, and compensatory stress responses, contrasting the adaptive thermogenic profile observed in chow-fed controls. Differentially expressed genes of epigenetic regulators such as Tet2, Dnmt3a and Apobec1 showed diet- and cold-dependent regulation, indicating impaired methylation flexibility under obesogenic conditions. Using cell culture experiments, we confirmed the regulation of gene expression of candidate genes, validating the functional link between DNA methylation and thermogenic gene regulation. This is the first study to demonstrate an epigenetic response to cold exposure that differs by dietary condition, particularly in obesity. Our findings highlight a coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic remodeling of BAT, shaped by both environmental and metabolic signals. These insights may inform targeted epigenetic or nutritional strategies to restore BAT function and would further strengthen our understanding of how these might be used as therapeutic basis to improve metabolic health in obesity.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Quantification of BAT mass is most commonly performed by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), which requires antecedent cold exposure. We hypothesized that 18F-fluorocholine PET could detect human BAT due to its requirement for considerable phosphatidylcholine synthesis, secondary to brown adipocytes high mitochondrial density and multiple lipid droplets. Methods: 1) Six healthy men with detectable 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake by BAT were recruited to a randomised crossover study investigating 18F-fluorocholine uptake by BAT during warm and cold exposure. 2) 18F-fluorocholine uptake by supraclavicular adipose tissue was quantified in 76 patients who had undergone 18F-fluorocholine PET/CT scanning. 3) Choline transporter expression was quantified in human BAT and white adipose tissue (WAT), and in brown and white adipocytes. 4) Lipidomics was performed on human brown adipocytes incubated with 15N-choline to determine phospholipid synthesis. Results: 1) 18F-Fluorocholine uptake by BAT was substantially greater than by WAT during both warm and cold exposure. 2) 18F-Fluorocholine uptake by supraclavicular adipose tissue was higher in the colder seasons, inversely associated with body mass index, and positively associated with tissue radiodensity. 3) Expression of the choline transporter SLC44A3 was higher in human supraclavicular BAT than WAT, while SLC44A2 was expressed more highly in human brown than white adipocytes. 4) 15N-choline tracing in human brown adipocytes identified incorporation into >30 phosphatidylcholine species.

The current study developed novel cell-assembled scaffolds for co-delivering human ASCs and ECFCs within a supportive decellularized adipose tissue (DAT) matrix, with the objective of enhancing their localized retention and augmenting their capacity to stimulate adipose tissue regeneration. Human ASCs and ECFCs were seeded separately onto human-derived DAT microcarriers under cell-type specific conditions. The cell-seeded microcarriers were then combined and cultured for 8 days under conditions that promoted matrix remodeling to fuse the microcarriers into 3D engineered tissues containing ASCs+ECFCs, ASCs alone, or ECFCs alone. Co-culture with ECFCs within the scaffolds was shown to modulate ASC pro-angiogenic gene expression, with some ECFCs forming tubule-like structures in vitro in both the ASC+ECFC and ECFC alone groups. In vivo bioluminescence imaging using a dual luciferase reporter system showed that co-delivery with ASCs enhanced ECFC retention following subcutaneous implantation in athymic nu/nu mice, but co-delivery did not alter the localized retention of viable ASCs. Interestingly, while immunofluorescence staining for CD31 and microcomputed tomography angiography indicated that vascular regeneration was similar in the cell-assembled scaffolds containing ASC+ECFCs, ASCs alone, and ECFCs alone, histological staining revealed that extensive regions of the ECFC alone scaffolds had remodelled into adipose tissue at 29 days post-implantation.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Despite its ubiquity, the potential impact of this phenomenon on biomolecular condensation has been largely overlooked. Here, we uncover how this chemically subtle modification can exert broad and multifaceted control over phase behaviour, using Grh1, a Golgi-associated protein involved in stress-induced secretion in yeast, as a model system. We show that Nt-acetylation increases the saturation concentration for condensation, reduces droplet size and number, dampens pH sensitivity, weakens electrostatic contributions, and suppresses water dipolar relaxation within condensates, indicating reduced internal hydration and environmental responsiveness. These effects are accompanied by acetylation-dependent dimerisation and local structural changes, including a concentration-dependent gain in -helicity. Remarkably, co-condensation assays reveal that acetylated and non-acetylated forms of the same protein are only partially miscible, giving rise to core-shell architectures driven by differences in interfacial tension. Together, our findings highlight Nt-acetylation as a potent, generalizable regulator of condensate material properties, linking primary sequence chemistry to mesoscale organisation. Given its evolutionary conservation and prevalence across eukaryotic proteomes, Nt-acetylation may represent a widespread mechanism for modulating protein condensation in health and disease.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we report that during early acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AILI), hepatocytes exhibit transient proliferation suppression, most pronounced in mid-zone hepatocytes due to zonal APAP metabolism. Using spatial transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and functional studies, we identified a unique mid-zone stress-response program. Central to this adaptation is the Atf4-Chop axis, which actively suppresses proliferation via the cell cycle inhibitor Btg2, prioritizing cytoprotection over cell division. This transient arrest is a critical survival strategy: halting energy-intensive proliferation during peak injury allows mid-zone hepatocytes to redirect resources towards protection, enhancing their survival in early AILI. Thus, Atf4-Chop-mediated quiescence preserves a hepatocyte reservoir necessary for subsequent regenerative proliferation and effective repair.

To cytogenetically characterize the Cuscuta species of Subulatae and investigate the chromosomal evolution of the subgenus Grammica, CMA/DAPI banding, FISH with 5S and 35S rDNA, and flow cytometry were performed on C. argentinana and C. parodiana. Both species exhibited 2n = 30 with differences in chromosome size, heterochromatic banding patterns, and genome size. Cuscuta argentinana has smaller chromosomes and genome (1C = 1.49 Gbp) and a higher number of metacentric chromosomes and CMA/DAPI- bands, whereas C. parodiana (1C = 2.79 Gbp) exhibits heterochromatin accumulation and a higher number of submetacentric chromosomes and heterochromatin accumulation. While the number of 5S rDNA sites was the same (six sites), C. parodiana presented one more pair of 35S rDNA sites.

Several studies focus on high-throughput screening of structural proteins, which is crucial for understanding and improving proteins by analyzing entire sequence spaces, as demonstrated in directed evolution. A major challenge is the poor biomanufacturability of recombinant structural proteins, often due to toxicity issues (e.g., aggregation, cell stress, inclusion bodies) limiting yield. High-throughput screening can help solve these issues and improve the biomanufacturability of structural proteins. Based on naturally observed squid ring teeth proteins, we introduce a structural protein library, enabling us to explore a broad sequence space. We selected 33 amino acid fragments with four repeats from six different native squid species, creating a recombinant protein library of about 1.2 million variants (i.e., 334). We demonstrated an orthogonal screening method that combines fluorescent-assisted cell sorting (FACS) and fluorescent microcapillary-array-based screening to establish correlations from genotype to single cells and ensembles. This optical high-throughput approach enables screening across the spectrum from individual cells to groups, facilitating the enrichment of desired clones. Our workflow distinguishes between expression and growth traits, supporting systematic genetic design studies focused on biomanufacturability. We observed that brighter clones tend to contain self-similar sequences (i.e., perfect repeats of fragments), whereas dimmer clones in the library have less similarity (i.e., imperfect repeats).

The current study investigated the causal and time-specific involvement of S1 in tactile detection using single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS). In two experiments, spTMS was applied over contralateral S1, an active control site (inferior parietal lobe; IPL), or under a sham condition at short (25 & 75 ms; Experiment 1) and longer (130 ms; Experiment 2) intervals following electrotactile stimulation of the finger. Participants performed a go/no-go detection task at sensory threshold. In Experiment 1, tactile sensitivity was significantly reduced following early S1 stimulation compared to both active control and sham conditions. However, no such effect was observed in Experiment 2, indicating a temporally limited role of S1 in conscious detection. Moreover, self-reported TMS-related distraction ratings did not account for the observed sensitivity differences, suggesting sensitivity-specific modulation by early TMS rather than general task disruption. These findings support a causal role for early S1 activity in conscious tactile detection. We propose that disruption at this early stage interferes with the initial encoding of tactile input, thereby attenuating not only immediate perceptual awareness, but also subsequent functions such as discrimination and retention. Overall, the results underscore the constrained role of S1 in conscious stimulus detection and highlight the importance of neural networks beyond S1.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

In this study, we examined how immune activation affects the expression of genes encoding TRP precursors and receptors (TRP and TRPR) and whether TRPs directly modulates selected immune mechanisms in the pest species Tenebrio molitor. Our results revealed two important insights. First, after activation of the immune system, TRP and TRPR genes were significantly downregulated in the nervous system and immune-related cells. These changes are closely correlated with the changes of the expression level of immune genes. We then show using Spantide II, a potent antagonist of TRPR, and RNAi knock-down of TRP and TRPR the modulation of key processes of the T. molitor humoral response. This includes the over-expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides and the important arthropod immune effector phenoloxidase activity.

Understanding how such functions arise from individual species and their interactions remains a major challenge, limiting efforts to rationally design and control microbial communities. Because current holistic (meta-omics) and reductionist (isolation- or single-cell-based) approaches struggle to capture these emergent microbial community functions, this study explores an intermediate strategy: analyzing simple sub-community combinations to enable a bottom-up understanding of community-level functions. To examine the validity of this approach, we used a nine-member synthetic microbial community capable of degrading the environmental pollutant aniline, and systematically generated a dataset of 256 sub-community combinations and their associated functions. Analyses using random forest models revealed that the sub-community combinations of just three to four species enabled the quantitative prediction of functions in larger communities (5-9 member; Pearson r = 0.780-0.801). Prediction performance remained robust even with limited sub-community data, suggesting applicability to more diverse microbial communities where exhaustive sub-community observation is infeasible. Moreover, interpreting models trained on these simple sub-community combinations enabled the identification of key species and interspecies interactions that strongly influence the overall community function. These findings provide a methodological framework for mechanistically dissecting complex microbial community functions through sub-community-based analysis.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

In S. pneumoniae, a human pathogen, competence-induced predation is well characterized and involves the release of bacteriocins and a murein hydrolase to lyse noncompetent siblings and liberate DNA. In contrast, in the human commensal S. mitis, mechanisms mediating DNA acquisition remain poorly understood. Here, we identify a diverse set of competence-associated bacteriocins (cab) that are produced by S. mitis during the late phase of competence. We focus on one bacteriocin pair, CabAB, that triggers contact-dependent growth inhibition and lysis of S. pneumoniae through activation of the major pneumococcal autolysin LytA. We demonstrate that CabAB compromises S. pneumoniae membrane integrity, leading to formation of intracellular membrane aggregates and the release of cytoplasmatic content, thereby increasing available DNA, which enhances HGT from S. pneumoniae to S. mitis in biofilms. These findings uncover a mechanism of interspecies predation and gene acquisition, revealing a critical role for competence-associated bacteriocins in shaping evolutionary dynamics of streptococci.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

E.; Li, G.-W.", "abstract": "Genes in many bacteria are rich in purine nucleotides and poor in pyrimidines. We show that this purine preference is critical for gene expression because it prevents premature transcription termination in species that exhibit runaway transcription. In contrast to coupled transcription-translation, runaway RNA polymerases that outpace trailing ribosomes have exposed nascent RNA and are vulnerable to the termination factor Rho. Using a massively parallel reporter assay in Bacillus subtilis, we found that Rho-dependent termination requires a high C-to-G skew and high T content. Consequently, purine-rich coding (sense) sequences escape premature termination, whereas the correspondingly pyrimidine-rich antisense sequences are targeted by Rho and transcriptionally silenced. This purine requirement drives biased codon usage in most bacterial species with runaway transcription, except in lineages that have lost Rho. Our results suggest that the avoidance of premature transcription termination imposes major constraints on nucleotide content during genome evolution and adaptation of foreign genes.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

While NSP14 has emerged as a promising drug target, its role in host-virus crosstalk and the cellular consequences of NSP14 inhibition remain poorly understood. Here, we present the identification and characterization of C10, a highly potent and selective first-in-class non-nucleoside inhibitor of the NSP14 S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-binding pocket. C10 demonstrates robust antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, including its variants, with EC50 values ranging from 64.03 to 301.9 nM, comparable to the FDA-approved drug remdesivir in our cell-based assays. C10 also exhibits broad-spectrum activity against other betacoronaviruses and inhibits SARS-CoV-2 at the replication stage. C10 suppresses viral translation and exhibits immunostimulatory effect. Additionally, C10 specifically reversed NSP14-mediated alterations in host transcriptome. The antiviral efficacy of C10 was further validated in a transgenic mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our findings highlight C10 as a promising candidate for the development of effective treatments against SARS-CoV-2 and its emerging variants.

Notably, ncaa introduction can be used in vaccinology to enhance the adaptability and immunogenicity of putative vaccine candidates. Cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) represents the most promising methodology to introduce ncaa into recombinant proteins of interest. However, traditionally used prokaryotic CFPS systems show limitations to produce complex proteins requiring post-translational modifications, whilst eukaryotic CFPS systems have historically been difficult to scale and show low protein yields. In this work, we establish the site-specific introduction of ncaas into complex proteins with the high-yielding and scalable eukaryotic tobacco BY-2 CFPS system (BYL), commercialised as ALiCE(R). The tyrosine transferase from Escherichia coli (eTyrT) was tested for amber suppression-mediated ncaa incorporation in BYL. eTyrT showed high incorporation yields of up to 2mg/ml recombinant protein for the azido-tyrosine and alkyne-tyrosine ncaas, with linear scalability up to 10ml without any losses in protein yield. We applied ncaa incorporation in BYL to enable click chemistry bioconjugation of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of influenza hemagglutinin to pre-assembled hepatitis B core (HBc) virus-like particles (VLPs). BYL efficiently produced the alkyne-modified RBD and azido-modified HBc VLPs, and their conjugation via copper-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) led to structurally intact, RBD-coated particles. VLP-RBD conjugates could efficiently hemagglutinate chicken erythrocytes where the individual proteins could not, proving both the sialic-acid binding activity of the RBD and its multivalent presentation by the HBc VLP. Finally, when used to vaccinate mice the conjugated RBD-VLPs showed a greater protection against live influenza challenge than free RBD.

Among others, the histone 3 lysine 9 me3 (H3K9me3) post translational modification participates in silencing lineage-inappropriate genes. H3K9me3 restricts access of transcription factors and other regulatory proteins to cell-fate controlled genes. In mice, olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) express one olfactory receptor (OR) gene out of 2,600 possibilities. This monoallelic and stochastic OR choice happens as OSNs differentiate and undergo dramatic changes in nuclear architecture. OR genes from different chromosomes converge into specialized nuclear bodies and chromatin compartments as H3K9me3 and chromatin binding proteins including heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) are incorporated. In this work, we have uncovered an unexpected role for HP1B in OR choice and neuronal identity that cannot be rescued by HP1a in vivo. With the use of a conditional knock-in mouse model that replaces HP1B for HP1a, we observe changes in H3K9me3 levels, DNA accessibility, and Hi-C contacts over OR gene clusters. These changes alter the expression patterns that partition the mouse olfactory epithelium into five OR expression zones, which results in a reduced OR repertoire leading to a loss of olfactory sensory neuron diversity. We propose that HP1B modulates the competition of OR-promoters for enhancers to promote receptor diversity, by establishing repression gradients in a zonal fashion.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Since productivity also depends on innate abilities, we ask whether economic exchange could have influenced human evolution and promoted adaptive genetic diversity. We model a system where individuals produce and exchange goods under a Walrasian equilibrium, with abilities determined by an evolving quantitative genetic trait. We then analyse how exchange shapes the evolutionary pressures on this trait. Our analysis demonstrates that exchange consistently promotes negative frequency-dependent selection, which favours the maintenance of genetic diversity. Exchange also generates stable long-term adaptive polymorphism when the production of goods requires different abilities. Importantly, we establish that the mode of exchange matters: markets, where individuals can switch trading partners, promote genetic diversity under broader conditions than when exchange occurs in isolated pairs. Finally, we show that genetic diversity and economic specialisation can facilitate the emergence of the other under a wider range of conditions. Our findings suggest that economic exchanges play a crucial role in fostering biological diversity and offer insights into how a culturally determined mode of organisation may have shaped human evolution.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Yet, some species (e.g. in ciliates, nematodes, crustaceans, insects, vertebrates) deviate from this dogma, by systematically eliminating parts of their DNA in all their somatic nuclei, in a process called Programmed DNA Elimination (PDE). PDE leads to two coexisting genomes: a full germline genome, and a reduced somatic genome. PDE by chromosome fragmentation has been historically identified in one clade of parasitic nematodes, Ascarids, in 1887, and later also revealed in ciliate protists, in copepods and other obligate parasitic nematodes. However, and in contrast to extensive studies performed in ciliates, the molecular mechanisms, evolutionary origins, and functional significance of PDE in animals remain unclear. This lack of understanding partially stems from limitation in genetically tractable model species. Recently, PDE has been discovered in three non-parasitic, lab-tractable nematode species from the Rhabidtidae family. Identified using genomic approaches, Oscheius tipulae PDE targets 0.6% of its genome. We uncovered that two species in the Mesorhabditis genus eliminate ~30% of their genome in the soma. In this study, we used cytological approaches to screen 25 other Rhabditidae species for PDE. We found evidence of PDE in 17 species. Our work reveals that PDE is present in 12 out of 17 tested genera, demonstrating its widespread presence in Rhabditidae nematodes, with the notable exception of C. elegans.

Theory and Methods: An OC framework was developed to design a single pulse shape that can be flexibly applied for arbitrary pulse train parameters and outperform typically used CEST saturation pulses shapes. The pulse design was developed primarily with a continuous wave spectrum (CW) as the optimization target, but can be easily adapted to specific scenarios. The generalized OC pulse was evaluated through simulations, phantom, and in vivo measurements on a 3 T clinical scanner. Performance was assessed in terms of contrast, robustness to field inhomogeneities, and resilience against artifacts such as Rabi oscillations and sidebands, compared to established saturation techniques. Results: Investigations showed that the generalized OC pulse achieved a contrast matching CW saturation and also functioned well under field inhomogeneities. Low-pass filtering of the optimized pulse shape effectively suppressed artifacts outside the initial optimization frequency range, enabling generalization across different field strengths. Phantom experiments consistently showed higher contrast than Gaussian, Fermi, and adiabatic spin-lock pulses for various CEST agents covering most clinically relevant regimes. In vivo imaging demonstrated substantially enhanced CEST contrast for both creatine/phosphocreatine in muscle and Amide Proton Transfer (APT) in brain compared to Gaussian saturation.

The approach leverages carefully engineered, event-level biophysical features extracted from either scaled current and conductance state sequences. Through systematic UMAP analysis of this feature space, we reveal that filtering away the shortest events effectively enriches the dataset with more discriminative longer events, leading to improved classification.

However, the progression from harmless monomeric Syn to misfolded oligomers and fibrillar species remains largely unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of Cyanidin, a naturally occurring neuroprotective compound, on the aggregation properties of -syn using a combination of various biophysical tools. Thioflavin T fluorescence measurements revealed the inhibition of -syn fibrillation in the presence of sub-stoichiometric concentration of Cyanidin, indicating its effect on -syn nucleation. Ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatographic analyses demonstrated that increasing concentrations of Cyanidin reduced the conversion of monomers to aggregated forms of -syn. Analysis of the aggregation reaction of -syn based on monomer concentration suggested that Cyanidin reduces the in-vitro conversion of monomers to amyloid nuclei at sub-stoichiometric micromolar concentrations. Cyanidin was observed to bind weakly with the unstructured, monomeric -syn, limiting the nucleation step and modulating the pathway to form conformationally restrained, SDS-resistant -helical higher-order oligomers (~670 kDa), which are less-hydrophobic. AFM and TEM images show that Cyanidin also possesses strong fibril disaggregation activity. Furthermore, seeding studies reveal that the higher-order oligomers, which are otherwise stable, destabilise upon sonication and attain seeding capability. Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) reveal weak interactions between Cyanidin and Syn, with a dissociation constant in the mM range. Interestingly, Cyanidin-generated oligomers increase the viability of neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells, thereby protecting the neuronal cells from degeneration. Our study suggests that stabilization of structured oligomers by small molecule modulators like Cyanidin provides a viable strategy to interfere with Syn fibrillization.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Invasive lobular cancer (ILC) is the most common special subtype, accounting for 10-15% of all breast cancers. The pathognomonic feature of ILC is the loss of E-cadherin (CDH1), which leads to a unique single-file growth pattern of discohesive cells. Although ILCs show better prognostic factors than the most common No Special Type (NST) of breast cancer, patients with ILC have worse long-term outcomes, which is not well understood. In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize Patient-Derived Xenograft (PDX) models of ILC based upon the presence of truncating CDH1 mutations and/or low CDH1 mRNA expression among 128 human breast cancer PDX models. We selected 8 PDX models for validation using Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis for E-Cadherin, p120, ER, PR, and HER2. We confirmed that seven of these PDX models are indeed ILC while one was identified as mixed NST-ILC PDX. Molecular analysis of the confirmed ILC PDX models showed enrichment of truncating CDH1 mutations, significantly lower levels of CDH1 mRNA expression and predominantly luminal subtypes compared to NST PDX models, in line with the molecular characteristics of human ILC disease. The commonly altered genes in the ILC PDX models included PIK3CA (57%), CDH1 (57%) and TP53 (57%) among others. Our study confirms and characterizes new ILC PDX models, offering valuable tools to advance our understanding of human ILC biology and support the development of innovative treatment strategies.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

This maturation is associated with an increase in the sensitivity of the CB electrophysiological response to hypoxia (chemosensitivity): a process that is incompletely understood but critical to systemic oxygen homeostasis. Hypothesizing that perinatal CB gene expression changes would reveal candidate mechanisms for oxygen chemosensitivity, we studied the CB transcriptome in sheep, where peri-natal CB physiology is well-characterised. CB-mediated cardiovascular reflexes are detectable at fetal day 120, and robust by term (day 145), while hypoxic ventilatory responses are established by post-natal day 15. We performed RNA sequencing on sheep CBs at each of these stages, and adults, along with the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) as an oxygen-insensitive control. This allowed us to define tissue-specific changes in the CB transcriptome correlating with chemosensitivity maturation. Striking, progressive CB enrichment is observed in genes implicated in murine CB chemosensitivity, including potassium channels (KCNK9), mitochondrial complex IV regulators (NDUFA4L2, HIGD1C), and HIF-2; (EPAS1). Genes with this expression pattern are also enriched for regulators of diacylglycerol (DAG), particularly the DAG kinase DGKH: one of the most abundant CB transcripts increasing in parallel with chemosensitivity. Across developmental stages, the CB also exhibits marked down-regulation of metabolic pathways and ATP/GTP consuming processes, potentially providing a state permissive to metabolic signal detection. Together, this builds a detailed picture of the CB transcriptional signature, with core features established in fetal life and conserved across species.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "Some biochemical functions can be performed more efficiently when split into different tasks, each performed by distinct strains within a microbial consortium. Due to the distinct growth dynamics of each strain, uncontrolled consortia have unstable composition dynamics, leading to the rapid loss of the community level function. Several approaches have been developed to stabilize consortia, with most relying on communicated-mediated growth and death feedback. These approaches require accurate communication between strains to maintain control, something which is not guaranteed under non-well-mixed conditions. As such, these methods are of limited utility in consortia applications with poorly mixed environments e.g. industrial scale bioreactors or soil. Here, inspired by microbial phase variation dynamics, we introduce an alternative, communication-free approach in which a set of genetically identical cells switch stochastically between distinct phenotypes. In this scheme, the population composition is dynamically stable and determined by the rates of transitions between states. Mathematical modeling indicates that this approach can stabilize consortia. Experimentally, we used reversible DNA inversions catalyzed by serine recombinases to implement a dynamic consortium. We then characterized the dynamic properties of the consortium at the single cell and bulk levels, and demonstrated control in 2- and 3-state consortia. These results provide a composition control approach that does not rely on cell to cell communication, providing a foundation for deployment of engineered consortia in complex, and sometimes non-mixed, environments such as industrial scale bioreactors or the human gut.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we employ lineage-resolved single-cell transcriptomics to systematically map heritable cell states that persist across divisions, distinguishing them from transient fluctuations within a cell cycle. We uncover that heritable states are underpinned by widespread transcriptional memory, whereby gene expression is heritable, defining two classes of states in cancer and stem cells: clustered states, characterized by clustered gene expression, and latent states, marked by non-clustered gene expression. This memory shows unexpected conservation across cell types and conditions and is maintained by robust epigenetic mechanisms resistant to environmental perturbations. Functionally, memory genes predict critical behaviors including metastatic potential and lineage commitment, with latent-state genes often outperforming clustered-state genes.

We developed and evaluated a biologically optimized, non-lethal sperm collection protocol for Rana muscosa, a critically endangered frog in a long term conservation breeding program. Thirteen hormone treatments were tested across six post-injection time points, and sperm quality was assessed via concentration, motility, osmolality, and pH. Generalized linear mixed models revealed that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRHa) alone significantly outperformed hCG based regimens. The 3 ug per g GnRHa dose yielded the highest sperm concentration and sustained motility from 3 to 24 hours post-injection. Motility was highest under moderately acidic (pH 6.5 to 7.0) and hypoosmotic (75 to 100 mOsm per kg) conditions. To support decision-making, we used a Wildlife Sperm Index (WSI) developed by our team that integrates sperm traits and environmental parameters into a single composite score. While 3ug per g GnRHa ranked highest by concentration alone, 4ug per g GnRHa achieved the top WSI score due to greater environmental (pH and osmolality) compatibility.

We collected two sessions of the localizer from 17 healthy adults. From the localizer data, we could identify ITG-math based on higher responses in the numerosity than the color task in 92% of the participants, whereas contrasting digits with UFOs lead to selective responses in only 32% of the participants. Accordingly, in independent data, ITG-math showed a task preference, but no stimulus preference.

This study aims to: 1) quantify healthy young adults' ability to perceive external perturbations while balancing on a stabilometer, and 2) understand the relationship between balance performance and perturbation magnitude relative to participants' perception threshold. Participants (n=22; 20-35 years) completed a multiple staircase protocol. While standing on a stabilometer mounted on a moving platform, they attempted to keep it horizontal during 10-second trials with small continuous perturbations. After each trial, participants were asked whether they perceived the platform movement. Perturbation magnitudes were adjusted for the next trial based on their response. This process continued for each staircase until the termination criteria were met, at which point participants' individual perception threshold was determined. Participants then performed ten 40-second trials on the stabilometer, two trials in each condition: without perturbation, perturbation at the 100%, 80%, and 50% of the individual's perception threshold, and the pilot study's minimum threshold. Balance performance was defined as time-in-balance ratio and RMS deviation angle from horizontal. Perception thresholds varied significantly between participants individuals, with an RMS acceleration ranging from 2.67 and 12.80 cm/s^2. The results showed that perturbation magnitude has a significant correlation with variability in deviation angle (R=0.24, p=0.0038).

Using data from a navigation task on the \"Honeycomb\" maze that allows dissociation of head-, movement- and goal-direction correlates, we found that hippocampal theta sweeps exhibit robust goal-oriented directional biases, independent of movement- or head-direction. An existing model of theta sweeps, with an additional goal-oriented directional input, reproduces these findings and predicts goal-oriented theta phase precession, which we confirm empirically. Replay events during immobility-related sharp wave/ripples are also goal-directed, and therefore more aligned with theta sweeps than experience.

E.; Hall, D.; Kaplan, M.; Garan, S.; Eichner, T.; Moehle, M.", "abstract": "Parkinsons disease is a neurodegenerative movement disorder which is characterized by cardinal motor symptoms of tremor at rest, rigidity, bradykineasia, and postural instability. Underlying these cardinal motor symptoms is thought to be death and dysfunction of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons, and the gold-standard treatment of Parkinsons disease is dopamine replacement therapy with the dopamine precursor L-DOPA. While efficacious, L-DOPA does not treat all motor symptoms and can have serious treatment-related side effects called L-DOPA induced dyskinesias, indicating an immense need for new targets to modulate dopaminergic function for anti-parkinsonian efficacy. One such potential target is the M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which has a unique expression profile where it is selectively expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons and their terminals in the striatum, and previous studies have indicated that M5 can modulate dopamine release and patterning of firing of dopamine neurons. Given this unique expression profile and function of M5, this receptor has an untested potential to modulate parkinsonian motor phenotypes. To test the potential for M5 to modulate Parkinsonian-like motor deficits and dyskinesia, we employed the unilateral 6-OHDA lesioned mouse model to create a hemi-parkinsonian state. Using multiple behavioral assays, including the cylinder test, forepaw adjusting steps assay, and in the Erasmus ladder, in conjunction with prototypical M5 pharmacological tool compounds, we investigated the ability of M5 to modulate parkinsonian motor deficits. Additionally, we tested the ability of M5 to modulate established L-DOPA induced dyskinesia or cause dyskinesia on its own. Overall, we found that M5 PAM alleviates forepaw asymmetry, bradykinesia, and spatial aspects of gait in the Erasmus ladder. Excitingly, M5 PAM does not cause robust dyskinesia, does not affect already established L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, and does not affect L-DOPA motor efficacy. Taken together with previous findings, the current study suggests that M5 receptors are an exciting novel therapeutic strategy for ameliorating parkinsonian motor deficits even in late-stage models of severe PD without lessening L-DOPAs motor benefit and without affecting existing symptoms of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

This dependency on blood feeding and subsequent detoxification renders this pathway as a vulnerable target for therapeutic intervention, particularly as it is the cause of morbidity in those infected.

Previous studies attribute the anti-inflammatory effects of F. prausnitzii A2-165 to production of the short-chain fatty acid butyrate, as well as a 15 kDa protein known as microbial anti-inflammatory molecule (MAM).

Monthly 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing of two size-fractions (0.22-3 {micro}m and >3 {micro}m) over 41 months (from April 2013 to August 2016) revealed marked differences in taxonomic composition, temporal variability, and ecological assembly processes.

In contrast, tropical communities were compositionally more stable and more governed by biotic factors and stochastic processes such as historical contingency and ecological drift. These patterns were consistent across taxonomic domains and size-fractions, though selection was generally stronger in prokaryotes and the smallest size-fraction. Co-occurrence networks at the temperate site were more densely connected and environmentally responsive compared to tropical networks, where stochastic processes and putative biological interactions gain prominence.

Morphological comparisons also provided support for the two groupings.

M.", "abstract": "A fascinating consequence of sexual conflict in animals is the maintenance of traits in males that cause physical damage to females during mating interactions. Such harm is hypothesised to be either an adaptation that enhances male fitness, or a collateral side-effect of adaptations that benefit males in other contexts. Tests of these hypotheses have mostly focused on traumatic copulation, where males wound females internally with weaponised genitalia, despite the widespread occurrence of extra-genital injury inflicted by non-genitalic structures like teeth, fangs or claws. Here, we take advantage of the unique mating interactions of the sexually cannibalistic springbok mantis, Miomantis caffra, to investigate the evolution of extra-genital wounding. Males of this species use their foretibial claws to stab females in the abdomen while fighting back against cannibalistic attacks during mating attempts. If stabbing females is adaptive, we predicted that experimentally wounded females would alter their remating behaviour or reproductive scheduling to the benefit of their mates. We found that injured females did not differ in their attractiveness or remating likelihood compared to intact females, and did not show an enhanced propensity to attack second courting males. Injured females also showed no change in mortality, fecundity, or offspring production that would suggest terminal investment due to male manipulation through wounding. However, our experiments revealed a statistically significant delay in the timing of remating among injured females, which could be interpreted as a benefit to males if such a delay reduces sperm competition. But given that remating was not prevented, only deferred, the injury-induced delay we observed is unlikely to be ecologically important, although field studies would be required to confirm this. Taken together, our results suggest that extra-genital wounding in the springbok mantis is unlikely to be adaptive but may instead be a pleiotropic side-effect of males trying to avoid being cannibalised.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Leveraging sequence-to-function deep learning models, we discovered 301 sequence motifs and predicted the functional impact of genetic variants through in silico mutagenesis, thereby facilitating the decoding of the regulatory syntax of the cattle genome and fine-mapping of GWAS loci for 22 complex traits. Cross-species analysis further revealed evolutionarily conserved features of regulatory architecture and provided evolutionary insights into complex traits and diseases in humans.

Here we explored the transcriptional dynamics in the anemonefish Amphiprion clarkii and its host anemone Entacmaea quadricolor 48 hours after association to identify the molecular underpinnings of their mutualistic relationship. Upon acclimation with an anemone, anemonefish showed differential regulation of sensory perception and memory genes in key brain regions, indicating activation of neural pathways that may facilitate host recognition and mutualism establishment. In the fish's skin, altered expression of genes involved in neurotransmitter release, cytoskeleton organization, and venom receptor proteins points to mechanisms of resistance to anemone venom. This resistance is particularly remarkable since anemone hosting fish exhibited increased expression of genes encoding mechanoreceptors, venom proteins, and ion channels involved in nematocyst discharge, indicating the anemone does indeed mount an active response to their mutualistic partner.

Existing methods, while powerful, often rely on heuristic search algorithms and non-differentiable scoring functions, which limits their direct integration into end-to-end deep learning pipelines. This paper introduces LieOTAlign, a novel and fully differentiable protein structure alignment framework built on the mathematical principles of Lie algebra and Optimal Transport (OT). LieOTAlign represents rigid body transformations within the Lie algebra of SE(3), which intrinsically preserves the geometric validity of rotations and translations during optimization. We formulate the alignment task as an optimal transport problem, seeking the most efficient mapping between two protein structures. This approach leads to a differentiable version of the TM-score, the Sinkhorn score, which is derived from the entropically regularized OT solution computed via the Sinkhorn algorithm. The entire LieOTAlign pipeline is differentiable, enabling the use of gradient-based optimizers like AdamW to maximize structural similarity. Benchmarking against the official TM-align on the RPIC dataset shows that LieOTAlign can identify longer, topologically significant alignments, achieving higher TM-scores. While the current RMSD is higher, LieOTAlign provides a powerful and flexible framework for protein structure alignment, paving the way for its integration into next-generation deep learning models for diverse bioinformatics challenges.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

RBPs are fine-tuned by a diverse array of post-translational modifications (PTMs), with important consequences for the assembly, dynamics and clearance of SGs. One of the best characterized SG nucleators is the RBP T-cell intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1), although knowledge about the structural and functional impact of its identified PTMs is very limited. TIA-1 is organized into three RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) and a C-terminal prion-related domain (PRD) that drives its phase separation from the cytosol. Here, we analyzed the effect of TIA-1 double phosphorylation in RRM3, at serines 198 and 199. Microscopic observations revealed an increased propensity of the phosphomimetic TIA-1 S198/199E to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and self-assemble into SGs independently of stress stimuli. Our computational simulations, supported by NMR data, have suggested that such phosphorylations promote the formation of a {beta}-hairpin motif at the beginning of the PRD. Moreover, the ALS-associated mutation V283M in TIA-1 was predicted to lead to the formation of an aberrant structure in the {beta}-hairpin region, highlighting the fine balance between physiological and pathogenic TIA-1 phase transition, and the importance of a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the liquid demixing of this RBP.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Using a unique proteomics-based strategy, we recently identified the active conformation of integrin-{beta}2 (aITGB2) as a novel, tumor-selective target for AML. Importantly, this conformational epitope is expressed widely on AML cells but minimally on normal marrow progenitors/healthy tissues. Here we first confirmed widespread aITGB2 expression on AML tumors that was largely independent of tumor genotype or prior therapeutic regimen. We developed diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals targeting aITGB2 utilizing a conformation-specific antibody (clone 7065). PET/CT imaging with 89Zr and 134Ce-labeled 7065 in AML models revealed high target-mediated uptake, greater than that compared to standard of care [18F]-FDG.

We found that persister cells can downregulate oxidative phosphorylation, a key source of reactive oxygen species, to avoid death from GPX4 inhibition. However, this can be overcome by pretreatment with clinically available histone deacetylase inhibitors which induce reactive oxygen species in persister cells and synergize with GPX4 inhibition. Furthermore, we found that while levels of iron, glutathione, and antioxidant genes are not universally dysregulated in persister cells, persister cells consistently downregulate alternative ferroptosis suppressor FSP1 and rely upon residual FSP1 to survive GPX4 inhibition. These findings reveal new strategies to eliminate persister cells by combining GPX4 inhibitors with histone deacetylase or FSP1 inhibitors.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

S.; Zhao, R.; Wang, H.; Peng, H.; Chrzanowski, W.; Cai, W.", "abstract": "Accurate reconstruction of neuronal morphology from three-dimensional (3D) light microscopy is fundamental to neuroscience. Nevertheless, neuronal arbors intrinsically exhibit slender, tortuous geometries with high orientation variability, posing significant challenges for standard 3D convolutions whose static, axis-aligned receptive fields lack adaptability to such complex morphology. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Morph-Aware Convolution (DMAC) framework, which incorporates inherent geometric priors into convolution by jointly adapting both the shape and orientation of the kernel. This enables morphology-aware feature extraction tailored to arborized and variably oriented neuronal trajectories. Specifically, we first apply dynamic tubular convolutions to bridge the structural mismatch between isotropic convolution kernels and the slender morphology of neurons. To sufficiently accommodate the 3D orientation variability of neuronal branches, we further introduce a rotation mechanism that dynamically reorients the tubular kernel via two learnable angles (elevation and azimuth), enabling precise alignment with local neuronal directions. We validate our method through extensive experiments on four mesoscaled neuronal imaging datasets, including two from the BigNeuron project (Drosophila and Mouse) and two additional benchmarks (NeuroFly and CWMBS). Our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average improvements of 5.4% in Entire Structure Average (ESA), 6.9% in Different Structure Average (DSA), and 7.5% in Percentage of Different Structure (PDS).

To explore this, we analyzed intracortical electrophysiological recordings during infusions of propofol, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine, using a rigorous method to estimate dynamical stability. We found that all three anesthetics, despite their molecular differences, similarly affect cortical states by destabilizing their dynamics. This destabilization matched the slower recovery from sensory perturbations and longer stimulus-induced autocorrelation times observed during the anesthetic infusions. The destabilization was also reflected predominantly in lower-frequency ranges, linking it to the well-known increase in low-frequency power during anesthesia. Finally, destabilization closely tracked real-time fluctuations in consciousness. Together, these findings suggest that cortical destabilization may be a shared neural correlate of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, offering a mechanistic explanation for low-frequency oscillations observed during anesthesia.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Transcriptome analysis revealed a pronounced transcriptomic response to paDMMB, with 884 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), compared to 291 for bafilomycin and 154 for rapamycin. paDMMB treatment upregulated genes associated with autophagy, mitochondrial stress responses, and proteostasis, while downregulating genes involved in miRNA processing and lipid catabolism. Rapamycin treatment downregulated amino acid biosynthesis pathways, while upregulating processes associated with nutrient starvation. Conversely, bafilomycin treatment upregulated genes related to lipid metabolism, while suppressing cytoskeletal programs. Transcriptomic comparisons revealed a striking overlap (95%) between paDMMB and bafilomycin signatures. Among the several biological processes affected by paDMMB, mitochondrial-related processes were strongly enriched. To determine whether the acute transcriptome changes caused by paDMMB led to persistent functional effects, we stimulated cells with DMMB and assessed mitochondrial respiration after a recovery period. paDMMB reduced basal respiration, ATP production, proton leak, and maximal respiration. These effects were not further altered by bafilomycin co-treatment but were markedly exacerbated by rapamycin.

Despite the helicate's tetragonal symmetry/shape being compatible with the 4WJ, microscale thermophoresis (MST), isothermal calorimetry (ITC) and gel electrophoresis competition experiments demonstrate that this metallo-supramolecule displays a stronger affinity for 3WJs (Kd = 12 nM) than for 4WJs (Kd > 4 microM) and other DNA structures. The experimental findings are supported by molecular dynamics simulations which reveal the critical role of size. Whilst the open form of the 4WJ is promoted when the helicate is in the cavity, the helicate's small size means it is unable to maintain contacts with all four junction base-pairs simultaneously. Although the helicate is slightly too large for the smaller 3WJ cavity, simulations and experiments show that it can open up the cavity (increasing the junction's hydrodynamic radius) by disrupting a base-pair. The flexible helicate also responds to the cavity upon binding by favouring one enantiomer and allowing the helicate to adopt a stable final structure inside the 3WJ that is an induced-fit of the two dynamic structures (supramolecule and DNA). This contrasts with previous lock-and-key examples of junction recognition and opens up new possibilities for how to design DNA and RNA junction-binding compounds.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

In Arabidopsis, H3K9 dimethylation (H3K9me2) promotes the removal of a transcription-associated mark, H3K4 monomethylation (H3K4me1), and this process within genes requires the histone demethylase LDL2. However, how LDL2 specifically functions in genes that accumulate H3K9me2 remains unknown. Here, we show that methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 8 (MBD8) binds to LDL2 and plays a role in H3K4me1 removal and transcriptional gene repression downstream of H3K9me2. MBD8 preferentially binds GC-poor DNA, regardless of its cytosine methylation status. Interestingly, LDL2 protein levels were significantly reduced in the mbd8 mutant background, suggesting that MBD8 stabilizes the LDL2 protein, facilitating H3K4me1 removal and the transcriptional repression of H3K9me-marked genes. The domain necessary for the MBD8-LDL2 interaction is conserved among plants. We propose that MBD proteins have diverse functions beyond their methylated DNA-binding capabilities.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

H.; Zihlmann, R.; Bannink, A.; Beauchemin, K.; Dijkstra, J.; Pressman, E. M.; van Gastelen, S.; Kebreab, E.", "abstract": "Beef cattle are a major source of enteric methane (CH4) emissions, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG). The feed additive 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP) has been shown to reduce CH4 emissions by inhibiting methyl-coenzyme M reductase, an enzyme critical to methanogenesis in archaea. This study aimed to quantify the effects of 3-NOP on CH4 production (g/d) and yield (g/kg DM intake; DMI) in beef cattle and to evaluate how diet composition influences the mitigation response. A systematic literature review identified 17 peer-reviewed in vivo studies, yielding 45 treatment means. Treatment effects were expressed as absolute and relative mean differences versus control groups. Predictor variables included 3-NOP dose, 3-NOP dose2, DMI, dietary concentration of NDF, CP, starch, fat, and organic matter (OM), roughage proportion, BW, and dietary inclusion of monensin (yes/no). Four types of models were developed, all including the intercept and 3-NOP dose as fixed predictors, differing as follows: (model 1) optional inclusion of 3-NOP dose2 when P < 0.10; (model 2) model 1 plus pre-inclusion of NDF concentration; (model 3) pre-inclusion of NDF concentration plus additional predictors (pairwise r [&le;] 0.5) that significantly improved model accuracy (P < 0.10); and (model 4) additional predictors selected under the same criteria as model 3, without pre-inclusion of NDF concentration. For models 3 and 4, a maximum of 5 predictors were considered and evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Across studies, 3-NOP doses ranged from 32 to 338 mg/kg of DM. On average, 3-NOP reduced CH4 production by 49.9 +/- 28.61 g/d (36.2 +/- 24.42%) and CH4 yield by 5.3 +/- 3.61 g/kg DMI (33.2 +/- 25.54%). The best models were selected based on biological interpretability, statistical significance, and predictive accuracy (as measured by RMSE) and included 3-NOP dose, dietary NDF concentration, DMI, and BW as significant predictors (the latter two only for absolute CH4 production). Mitigation efficacy increased with higher DMI and declined with increasing NDF concentration and BW. Absolute reductions of 53.1 g/d and 5.88 g/kg of DMI, and relative reductions of 37.6% in CH4 production and 35.0% in CH4 yield were predicted when moderators were at their mean value (3-NOP dose = 134.4 mg/kg of DM; NDF concentration = 32.8% of DM; DMI of 8.6 kg/d). These results support the effectiveness of 3-NOP in mitigating enteric CH4 emission in beef cattle and provide quantitative models to be used in assessment tools and GHG inventory methodology.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "The severity of influenza is often driven by an excessive host immune response rather than the virus itself, yet the key molecular drivers within specific immune cells remain poorly understood. While recent single-cell RNA sequencing studies have successfully identified immune populations involved, they have largely not identified the upstream drivers modulating their pro-inflammatory functions. Here we employed an integrated single-cell co-expression network to address this gap. Our analysis identified myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) as central to pro-inflammatory response during infection. Through a multi-layered key driver analysis, we pinpointed C-type lectin, CLEC4E as a top candidate modulating this pathological inflammatory response. The role of CLEC4E was confirmed in an independent single-cell dataset from influenza-infected patients and further validated in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of CLEC4E in a murine influenza model significantly reduced disease severity and lower viral titers in the lungs. This study not only clarifies that CLEC4E overexpression in mDCs contributes to pro-inflammatory signaling pathways influencing influenza severity but also shows the power of single-cell network approaches to uncover novel and robust therapeutic targets hidden within complex immune responses.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Images from CTL pigs showed peaks of activation in the primary somatosensory cortex, caudate nucleus, anterior prefrontal cortex, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex during stroking. Greater peaks of activation in the anterior prefrontal, ventral anterior cingulate, primary somatosensory and somatosensory association cortices were observed in POS pigs; whereas greater peaks of activation in the amygdala were observed in CTL pigs. Therefore, stroking is perceived and possibly elicited positive emotions in anesthetised pigs, and it may be perceived as more pleasant by experienced pigs than naive pigs, which may rather perceive it as a novel stimulus.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

This allowed us to identify an additional oligonucleotide-binding domain whose flexible structure may play an important function in the nucleolytic activity of SpnA. Affinity-pulldown mass spectrometry identified the complement system membrane attack complex C5b67 components as key interactors in human plasma. Cross-linking mass spectrometry combined with integrative modeling identified the direct binding interfaces between SpnA and C5b67. These interfaces are highly conserved among genetically diverse S. pyogenes strains. The interaction between SpnA and C5b67 is suggested to prevent the assembly of a functional membrane attack complex.

Reps nick viral DNA to expose a 3-prime end for polymerase extension, provide an NTP-dependent helicase activity for DNA unwinding, and join nicked ends to form circular viral genomes. Here, we present the first structures of a Rep protein from the Redondoviridae family, a newly discovered family of human-associated CRESS-DNA viruses that replicates within the oral protozoan Entamoeba gingivalis. Using cryo-EM, we characterized the hexameric structures of a Redondovirus Rep helicase bound with ATP{gamma}S, representing the initial ATP-bound state, and with ADP, reflecting the protein state after hydrolysis. The ADP state, but not the ATP state of Rep shows a staircase arrangement of DNA-binding loops that plays a central role in current models for SF3 helicase function. Additionally, we determined a head-to-tail dodecameric structure of ATP{gamma}S-bound Rep, in which both the helicase and endonuclease domains are ordered. Conservation of residues involved in stabilizing the dodecamer suggest that this assembly may be functionally relevant for many CRESS-DNA viruses. The positioning of endonuclease domains in the Rep hexamer, combined with our biophysical analyses of Rep oligomerization, provide new insights into Rep function during viral replication.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

These cancer cells are typically characterized by a quiescent state with suppressed activity of MYC and MTOR. We observed that the MYC-suppressed persistent triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells are metabolically flexible and can upregulate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes and respiratory function (OXPHOS-high cell state) in response to DNA-damaging anthracyclines such as doxorubicin, but not to taxanes. The elevated biomass and respiratory function of mitochondria in OXPHOS-high persistent cancer cells were associated with mitochondrial elongation and remodeling suggestive of increased mitochondrial fusion. A genome-wide CRISPR editing screen in doxorubicin-persistent OXPHOS-high TNBC cells revealed BCL-XL gene as the top survival dependency in these quiescent tumor cells, but not in their untreated proliferating counterparts. Quiescent OXPHOS-high TNBC cells were highly sensitive to BCL-XL inhibitors, but not to inhibitors of BCL2 and MCL1. Interestingly, inhibition of BCL-XL in doxorubicin-persistent OXPHOS-high TNBC cells rapidly abrogated mitochondrial elongation and respiratory function, followed by caspase 3/7 activation and cell death. The platelet-sparing proteolysis targeted chimera (PROTAC) BCL-XL degrader DT2216 enhanced the efficacy of doxorubicin against TNBC xenografts in vivo without induction of thrombocytopenia that is often observed with the first-generation BCL-XL inhibitors, supporting the development of this combinatorial treatment strategy for eliminating dormant tumor cells that persist after treatment with anthracycline-based chemotherapy.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Viral tracing demonstrates that aberrant striatal activity is ultimately transmitted to the insular cortex via the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, a potential target of deep brain stimulation in TS patients. We further identify tic-associated activity in the IC as well as the primary motor cortex (M1).

Seventy toddlers underwent MRI scanning and neurodevelopmental testing, and brain volumes in language-related areas were extracted. Structural equation modelling showed that at age two, there was a negative relationship between screen time and pars triangularis volumes. Importantly, smaller volumes at age two predicted greater screen time usage at age three, mediated by poorer language outcomes. These results suggest that over time, children with smaller volumes and weaker language skills at age 2 became more likely to rely on screens at age 3, suggesting that early vulnerabilities amplify later screen use, highlighting the sensitivity of language networks to environmental input and the potential for screen exposure to alter developmental trajectories.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

Flexible yet robust temporal representations can arise from two distinct computational modes: a coherence mode, where multiple cortical areas hold the same elapsed-time estimate, and an independence mode, where each area maintains its own local estimate. However, how the brain switches between these modes has remained unknown. Using mesoscale two-photon calcium imaging, we simultaneously recorded neuronal populations in the secondary motor cortex (M2) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of mice performing a novel alternating-interval timing task. Both areas encoded elapsed time through similar high-dimensional sequential activity. Decoding analyses revealed that the fronto-parietal network has both independent and coherent temporal codes. Communication-subspace analysis showed that temporal information was distributed across multiple low-variance subspaces, whereas the largest subspace preferentially encoded behaviour. A twin recurrent neural network (RNN) model with sparse inter-RNN connections and shared high-variance noise reproduced these experimental findings. Moreover, perturbations applied along the dominant shared subspace paradoxically enhanced independence between the two networks. Through a mathematical formalization based on the local Lyapunov exponents, we uncovered how perturbations along different subspaces selectively evoke either independent or coherent communication mode. Together, these results reveal a principle by which fronto-parietal circuits achieve robust yet flexible computation through the interplay of sparse coupling and shared global fluctuations.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

K.; Holst, S. B.; Khodosevich, K.", "abstract": "Background: Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and autism, affect a substantial portion of the global population, 1 in 8 individuals. Genetic risk factors have been the major contribution to neuropsychiatric disorders; however, there is limited knowledge of how risk factors lead to brain circuit impairment and neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Rationale: Understanding how risk factors impact brain circuitry in the whole brain level at cellular resolution and their connection to neuropsychiatric phenotypes should help develop specific drug targets and therapeutics targeting precisely the affected cell types and circuits. Methods: We employ a clinically relevant mouse model of one of the major neuropsychiatric genetic risk factors - microdeletion in the 15q13.3 locus. Using the model, we developed a novel technique, Psych-TRAP, to label psychiatric behavior-associated circuits at whole brain level and at cellular level. We validated the genetic mouse model with clinical phenotypes and labelled transiently active cells, using TRAP2, and quantified cell densities in the whole brain using an automated pipeline, ABBA. This is the first ever approach to validate a triple transgenic mouse line with psychiatric microdeletion and understanding the cellular activation pattern and differential recruitment of cells immediately after a psychiatric-like behavior. Key findings: Further, we validated Psych-TRAP by understanding the activation of cells in already known brain areas and novel brain areas and confirmed no direct involvement of non-neuronal cells right after 3-chmabered social interaction (3-CSI). Lastly, we discovered the involvement of a dominant GABAergic component in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), mainly mediated by reelin positive (REL+) neurons and by somatostatin positive (SST+) neurons in the primary somatosensory area-trunk (SSp-tr), in mice harboring 15q13.3 microdeletion. Future implications: Thus, Psych-TRAP is a robust technique to generate mice line with disrupted copy-number variations, label transiently active cells permanently for future circuit manipulations in an unbiased manner and reveal the underlying molecular markers mediating psychiatric behaviors. This can be extended further to understand the molecular mechanisms of active cells from a particular brain area, identified from Psych-TRAP, using spatial transcriptomics and promises a potential technique for translation research targeting specific manifestations.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Thalamocortical (TC) cells relay sensory information to the cortex, as well as driving their own feedback inhibition through collateral excitation of the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). The GABAergic cells of the TRN are extensively coupled through electrical synapses. While electrical synapses are most often noted for their roles in synchronizing rhythmic forms of neuronal activity, they are also positioned to modulate responses to transient information flow across and throughout the brain, although this effect is seldom explored. Here we sought to understand how electrical synapses embedded within a network of TRN neurons regulate the processing of ongoing sensory inputs during relay from thalamus to cortex. We used Hodgkin-Huxley point models to construct a network of a 9 TC and 9 TRN cells, with one cortical output neuron summing the TC activity. Each pair of TC and TRN cells was reciprocally coupled by chemical synapses. TRN cells were each electrically coupled to two neighboring cells, forming a ring topology. TC cells received synaptic inputs in sequence, with intervals between inputs varying from 10 to 50 ms across simulations. This architecture and sequence of inputs allowed us to assess the functional radius of an electrical synapse by comparing the cumulative effects of each additional TRN electrical synapse on the responses of the TRN and TC cells and the cortical output. Effects of electrical synapses on TRN cell activity were strongest for smaller intervals between inputs, and cumulative with additional synapses. In contrast, effects in TC neurons were strongest for larger intervals between inputs and also increased with coupling strength. Coupling within TRN modulated cortical integration of TC inputs by unexpectedly increasing response rates, duration and reducing spike correlation to the input sequence that was presented to the TC layer. Thus, embedded TRN electrical synapses exert powerful influence on thalamocortical relay, in a cumulative manner. These results highlight the multi-synaptic influences of electrically coupled cells and reinforce that they should be included in more complex and realistic networks of the brain.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}

We manipulated perception of energy balance using exogenous leptin, and social environment through acoustic playback, to ask how internal cues of energy availability are integrated with external social cues that promote singing. We found that both song playback and leptin injection promoted increased song effort. In the absence of song playback, leptin altered amplitude modulation in songs, but did not affect song rate. Additionally, we examined hormone and playback effects on non-vocal behaviors and found that leptin may shift physical activity away from cage exploration and toward wheel running. Finally, we found several positive associations between measures related to high song effort. These results demonstrate that male singing mice use both social context and energy balance to govern their investment in advertisement song and that leptin acts as a mediator of this process.", "date": "2025-08-25", "journal": ""}
