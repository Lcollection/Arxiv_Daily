Critically, this process continues even after demographic recovery due to a time-lagged genetic burden known as drift debt. Current conservation assessments, such as the IUCN Red List, focus on short-term extinction risk and do not capture the long-term consequences of genomic erosion. Likewise, the longer-term assessments of the IUCN Green Status may overestimate population recovery by failing to account for the lasting effects of genomic erosion. As genome sequencing becomes increasingly accessible, there is a growing opportunity to quantify genomic erosion and integrate it into conservation planning. Here, we use genomic simulations to illustrate how how different genomic metrics are sensitive to the drift debt. We test how ancestral effective population size (Ne) and bottleneck history influence the tempo and severity of genomic erosion, and demonstrate how these dynamics shape genetic load and additive genetic variation, key indicators of long-term evolutionary potential. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept for a Genomic Green Status framework that aligns genomic metrics with conservation impact assessments, laying the foundation for genomics-informed strategies to support species recovery.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

While morphogen gradients have long been recognized as a source of positional information, how timing is synchronized across developing tissues remains unclear. We propose a simple mechanism by which morphogen dynamics can also encode time. If the morphogen source expands with a uniformly growing tissue and the gradient maintains a constant decay length, cells experience transient, hump-shaped signals that convey timing cues. Moreover, when two opposing exponential gradients with equal lengths--such as those in the vertebrate neural tube--interact, their product forms a uniform signal that can synchronize fate decisions across the entire tissue. With increasing gradient amplitudes, cells encounter a transient signal; with constant amplitudes, the signal decays--a feature of a depletion timer. This mechanism provides a generalizable principle by which morphogen gradients may coordinate both spatial and temporal aspects of patterning during development.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

However, recent decision-making experiments in rodents have observed neurons across the brain that fire sequentially, rather than persistently, with the subset of neurons in the sequence depending on the animal's choice. We developed two new candidate circuit models in which neurons are active sequentially and transfer evidence faithfully to the next active population. One model encodes evidence in the relative firing of two competing chains of neurons, and the other in the network location of a stereotyped pattern (\"bump\") of neural activity. Neural recordings from four brain regions during an evidence accumulation task revealed that different regions displayed evidence tuning consistent with different candidate models. This work provides a mechanistic explanation for how graded information may be precisely accumulated within and transferred between neural populations, and suggests that different brain regions may accumulate evidence through different circuit mechanisms.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Since structures are constrained by their biological function, their geometry tends to evolve more slowly than the underlying amino acids sequences. This feature of structures could in principle be used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees over longer evolutionary timescales than sequence-based approaches, but until now a reliable structure-based tree building method has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the use of structure-based phylogenies can outperform sequence-based ones not only for distantly related proteins but also, remarkably, for more closely related ones. This is achieved by inferring trees from protein structures using a local structural alphabet, an approach robust to conformational changes that confound traditional structural distance measures. As an illustration, we used structures to decipher the evolutionary diversification of a particularly challenging family: the fast-evolving RRNPPA quorum sensing receptors enabling gram-positive bacteria, plasmids and bacteriophages to communicate and coordinate key behaviors such as sporulation, virulence, antibiotic resistance, conjugation or phage lysis/lysogeny decision.

Conversely, deletion of LmxPKAC3 resulted in reduced flagellar beat frequencies and swimming speed. The absence of LmxPKAC1 resulted in a lower incidence of high frequency tip-to-base waveforms, and consequently reduced swimming speed. LmxPKAC1 dissociated from cytoskeletons upon addition of guanosine, adenosine or inosine, consistent with a novel nucleoside-based PKA activation mechanism.

However, using these technologies successfully requires to know their properties in terms of sensitivity, efficiency, kinetics and mechanism. We previously developed an optogenetic tool made of a single chimeric protein called LiCre that enables the induction of specific changes in the genome with blue light via DNA recombination between loxP sites [1]. Here, we used in vitro and in vivo experiments combined with kinetic modeling to provide a deeper characterization of the photo-activated LiCre-loxP recombination reaction. We find that LiCre binds DNA with high affinity in absence of light stimulus and that this binding is cooperative although not as much as for the Cre recombinase from which LiCre was derived. In yeast, addition of riboflavin to the culture medium had no effect on LiCre efficiency, even when cells over-expressed riboflavin kinase, suggesting that abundance of the flavin mono-nucleotide co-factor is not limiting for the reaction. However, LiCre efficiency in yeast gradually increased when raising temperature from 20 to 37degC. The recombination kinetics observed in live cells are best explained by a model where photo-activation of two or more DNA-bound LiCre units (happening in seconds) can produce (in several minutes) a functional recombination synapse. This model was able to capture the effect of a point mutation altering LiCre light cycle. This deeper understanding of the LiCre-loxP system provides additional knowledge for designing experiments where specific genetic changes are induced in live cells with light.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Matrix striatonigral neurons reduced their activity before the cessation of self-paced locomotion, while patch striatonigral neuronal activity increased, suggesting an inhibitory function. Indeed, optogenetic activation of patch striatonigral neurons suppressed ongoing locomotion with reduced striatal dopamine release, contrasting with the locomotion-promoting effect of matrix striatonigral neurons, which showed an initial increase in dopamine release.

Contractile rings throughout phylogeny and in a range of cellular contexts are built from conserved components including non-muscle myosin II, actin filaments, and crosslinking proteins. To explore whether diverse actomyosin rings generate contractile force and close via a common mechanism, we studied three instances of ring closure within the continuous cytoplasm of the C. elegans syncytial oogenic germline: mitotic cytokinesis of germline stem cells, apoptosis of meiotic compartments, and cellularization of oocytes. The three ring types exhibited distinct closure kinetics and component protein abundance dyanmics. We formulated a physical model to relate measured closure speed and molecular composition dynamics to ring active stress and viscosity. We conclude that these ring intrinsic factors vary among the ring types. Our model suggests that motor and non-motor crosslinkers abundance and distribution along filaments are important to recapitulate observed closure dynamics. Thus, our findings suggest that across ring closure contexts, fundamental contractile mechanics are conserved, and the magnitude of contractile force is tuned via regulation of ring component abundance and distribution. These results motivate testable hypotheses about cytoskeletal regulation, architecture, and remodeling.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

However, the drivers and the traits that explain these crossing strategies remain poorly understood in part because so few species and barriers have been studied. Using a unique dataset from 67 recovered multi-sensor loggers, deployed across 17 species, we investigated when, where, and how birds cross two major marine barriers (Bay of Biscay, Mediterranean Sea) and a desert barrier (Sahara). Then, we relied on a comparative approach to examine the influence of wing morphology and plumage colour on these strategies. Our findings reveal important differences across barrier types. On average, birds fly at 1,600 m over the desert during nighttime, ascending to 2,800 m for prolonged daytime flights, while species crossing marine barriers fly significantly lower (750 m on average), in some cases flying just above the water surface during prolonged daytime flights. Wing morphology and plumage colour influence barrier-crossing strategies: flight altitude increases with wing area during both sea and desert crossings, and darker birds ascend to higher elevations during daytime Sahara crossings, likely to access cooler air and reduce solar heating. These findings refine hypotheses on barrier-crossing strategies and suggest broader ecological and evolutionary implications for migratory birds facing extreme environments.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

We propose and computationally explore a novel link between the nonlinear dendritic integration modes of parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking basket cells (PV+ FSBCs) and the modulation of hippocampal oscillations. Employing biophysical circuit level modeling, we test the hypothesis that PV+ FSBCs can flexibly adapt their firing patterns and influence rhythms, independent of gross changes in synaptic input quantity, by selectively engaging either their supralinear or sublinear dendritic branches. Specifically, supralinear dendrites promote high-frequency oscillations and reduce the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance in the circuit, whereas sublinear dendrites enhance slow oscillatory power and elevate the E/I balance. This bimodal dendritic strategy provides PV+ FSBCs with an energy efficient mechanism to regulate circuit and oscillatory dynamics without necessitating large scale increases in synaptic drive. Our findings thereby uncover a previously unrecognized role for PV+ FSBC dendritic computations in regulating memory-related oscillations, offering new, experimentally testable hypotheses into the subcellular mechanisms that govern hippocampal rhythm generation.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Recently, proteins such as P2RY12, TMEM119, and FCRLS have been proposed as microglia-specific and are now widely used to define microglial populations in health and disease. The specificity of these markers was predicated on the assumption that circulating monocytes retain their distinct signatures after entering the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we challenge this paradigm. Using a combination of bone marrow chimeras, single-cell RNA sequencing, ATAC-seq, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that monocytes engrafting into the CNS acquire de novo expression of these established microglia markers. This phenotypic conversion is driven by profound epigenetic reprogramming, characterized by dynamic changes in chromatin accessibility at key gene loci, including P2ry12, Tmem119, and Aif1 (Iba1), and a shift in transcription factor binding motifs toward a microglial profile. We show this process occurs in the retina following injury and, remarkably, under physiological conditions in the brain and spinal cord, where blood-derived monocytes progressively contribute to the resident myeloid pool. Furthermore, engrafted monocytes downregulate canonical monocyte markers (Ly6C, CD45), eventually becoming indistinguishable from embryonic microglia based on conventional phenotyping. Our findings reveal that infiltrating monocytes undergo extensive epigenetic and transcriptional remodeling to adopt a microglia-like fate, challenging the specificity of current markers and necessitating a re-evaluation of the distinct roles of these two cell populations in CNS pathology.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

In contrast with classical supervised learning models, recent work has revealed that CFs can signal reward-predictive information in some behaviors. This raises the question of whether CFs may also operate according to principles similar to those described by reinforcement learning models. To test how CFs operate during reward-guided behavior, and evaluate the role of reward-related CF activity in learning, we have measured CF responses in Purkinje cells of the lateral cerebellum during a Pavlovian task using 2-photon calcium imaging. Specifically, we have performed multi-stimulus experiments to determine whether CF activity meets the requirements of a reward prediction error (rPE) signal for transfer from an unexpected reward to a reward-predictive cue. We find that once CF activity is transferred to a conditioned stimulus, and there is no longer a response to reward, CFs cannot generate learned responses to a second conditioned stimulus that carries the same reward prediction. In addition, by expressing the inhibitory opsin GtACR2 in neurons of the inferior olive, and optically inhibiting these neurons across behavioral training at the time of unexpected reward, we find that the transfer of CF signals to the conditioned stimulus is impaired. Moreover, this optogenetic inhibition also impairs learning, resulting in a deficit in anticipatory lick timing. Together, these results indicate that CF signals can exhibit several characteristics in common with rPEs during reinforcement learning, and that the cerebellum can harness these learning signals to generate accurately timed motor behavior.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Being a novel class of insecticides, oligonucleotide insecticides target pest rRNAs and/or pre-rRNAs and recently showed high insecticidal potential against sap-feeding insect pests, main vectors of plant DNA viruses and one of the most economically-damaging groups of herbivorous insects. In order to use all possible opportunities of CUADb, in this article insecticidal potential of short 11-mer antisense DNA oligos was investigated for Coccus hesperidum control in comparison with long 56-mer single-stranded and double-stranded DNA sequences and lower efficiency of the latter was found. At the end of the experiment, on the 9th day, the highest mortality rate among antisense oligos was reached for Coccus-11 group (97.66 {+/-} 4.04 %), while for long sequences the highest mortality rate was obtained for double-stranded DNA fragment in dsCoccus-56 group (77.09 {+/-} 6.24 %). Also in this article architecture of DNA containment (DNAc) mechanism is described representing interesting and important for insect cell life interplay between rRNAs and different types of DNA oligos. During DNAc, Coccus-11 caused increased ribosome biogenesis and ATP production through metabolic switch in energy synthesis from carbohydrates to lipids but eventually caused ''kinase disaster'' through downregulation of most kinases due to insufficient level of ATP produced. In the course of DNAc, hypercompensation of target rRNA is triggered by all highly and all somewhat complementary DNA oligos but more pronounced later degradation of target rRNA and significant insect pest mortality is seen only in the case of perfect complementarity of oligonucleotides to target rRNA. For both short and long oligonucleotide insecticides substantial decrease in rRNA concentration after rRNA hypercompensation in average by 3.75-4.25 fold, is explained by the work of DNA-guided rRNase, like RNase H1. We detected significant upregulation of RNase H1 after application of Coccus-11 in this study. On the contrary, for short and long random DNA oligos concentration of rRNA decreased in average by 2-3 fold after rRNA hypercompensation due to normal half-life of rRNAs in insect cells provided by ribonucleases. Fundamentally important, obtained results show completely new principle of regulation of rRNA expression in the cell via complementary interaction between rRNAs and unmodified antisense sequences of exogenous DNA.

On the other hand, BR-bodies are repurposed from sites of mRNA decay to reservoirs for mRNA storage under stress; a functional change that is enabled by their transition to a more rigid state, marked by reduced internal dynamics, increased molecular density, and prolonged residence time of ribonuclease E. Furthermore, we manipulated ATP levels and translation rates, and we conclude that the accumulation of ribosome-depleted mRNA is a key factor driving BR-body rigification, and that condensate maturation further contributes to this process. Upon nutrient replenishment, stationary-phase BR-bodies disassemble, releasing stored mRNAs for rapid translation, demonstrating that BR-body function is governed by a reversible mechanism for resource management.

Here, we implement an integrated approach to investigate the structural evolution of nitrogenase, an ancient and globally essential enzyme responsible for biological nitrogen fixation. Despite the ecological diversity of its host microbes, nitrogenase retains strict functional constraints, including extreme oxygen sensitivity, high energy demands, and substrate availability. We combined phylogenetics, ancestral sequence reconstruction, protein crystallography and deep-learning based structural prediction to resurrect nearly three billion years of nitrogenase structural history. This effort represents the first effort to predict the full set of extant and ancestral structures along the evolutionary tree of a single enzyme, yielding over 5000 structural models. Our framework lays a foundation for reconstructing key structural constraints that shape protein evolution and examining ancient enzymes within the broader context of phylogenetic relationships and environmental transitions across geological timescales.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

This workflow is centered around a new computational tool, mbc-prime, that can generate a list of discriminative candidate primers and score them. We showcase the use of this tool in the design of primers for long-read metabarcoding of endophytic fungi in Vinca minor. Mbc-prime streamlines the design of fungus-specific primers, enabling efficient and plant-free amplification of fungal rDNA from mixed DNA samples. Our workflow can be used to study the composition of complex host-associated microbiomes.

However, the genomic diversity of Rickettsiella remains largely unexplored, and their genetic potential to induce complex phenotypes in arthropods is only partially understood. In this study, we sequenced five new Rickettsiella genomes isolated from three tick species. Through comparative genomics, we observed that Rickettsiella members share similar metabolic capabilities, and collectively lack virulence genes from pathogenic Legionellales. Additional analysis of Rickettsiella genomes revealed significant variability in metabolic properties related to endosymbiosis. Specifically, their capacity to biosynthesize certain B vitamins and heme varies, suggesting a functional role of some Rickettsiella strains in the nutrition of their arthropod hosts. Some Rickettsiella genomes harbour homologs of Wolbachia cif genes, the cause of Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility,, suggesting that Rickettsiella may use a similar molecular mechanism to manipulate the reproduction of their arthropod hosts. Phylogenomics further revealed that tick-borne Rickettsiella exhibit distinct evolutionary origins within the genus, indicating that Rickettsiella have undergone repeated horizontal transfers between ticks and other arthropods.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Recent evidence suggests that chronic changes in the microenvironment and local paracrine signaling are major drivers of these effects, but the precise effect of aging on these factors remains understudied. Here, for the first time, we directly compare extracellular vesicles obtained from young and aged patients to identify therapeutic or disease-associated agents, and directly compare vesicles isolated from heart tissue matrix (TEVs) or plasma (PEVs). While young TEVs and PEVs showed notable overlap of miRNA cargo, aged EVs differed substantially, indicating differential aging-related changes between TEVs and PEVs. TEVs overall were uniquely enriched in miRNAs which directly or indirectly demonstrate cardioprotective effects, with 45 potential therapeutic agents identified in our analysis. Both populations also showed increased predisposition to disease with aging, though through different mechanisms. Changes in PEV cargo were largely correlated with chronic systemic inflammation, while those in TEVs were more related to cardiac homeostasis and local inflammation. From this, 17 protein targets were identified which were unique to TEVs and highly correlated with aging and the onset of cardiovascular disease. Further analysis via machine learning techniques implicated several new miRNA and protein targets, independently suggesting several of the targets identified by non-machine learning analysis, which correlated with aging-related changes in TEVs. With further study, this biomarker set may serve as a powerful, potential indicator of cardiac health and age which can be measured from PEVs. Additionally, several proposed young-enriched therapeutic agents were validated and, when tested, could successfully prevent cell death and cardiac fibrosis in disease-like conditions.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Microbiomes have the capacity to influence their hosts' fitnesses, but the conditions under which such influences contribute to evolution are not clear. This is due in part to a lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework for describing the combined effects of host and associated microbes on phenotypic variation. Here we address this gap by extending the foundations of quantitative genetic theory to include host-associated microbes, as well as alleles of hosts, as factors that explain quantitative host trait variation. We introduce a way to partition host-associated microbiomes into components relevant for predicting a microbiome-mediated response to selection. We then apply our general framework to a simulation model of microbiome inheritance to illustrate principles for predicting host trait dynamics, and to generalize classical narrow and broad sense heritabilities to account for microbial effects. We demonstrate that microbiome-mediated responses to host-level selection can arise from various transmission modes, not solely vertical, but that the contribution of non-vertical modes can depend strongly on host life history.

Participants listened passively, while watching a silenced movie, to non-social auditory stimuli designed to either remain lateralized to one hemifield (stay trials), or to change in location from one side to the contralateral hemifield (jump trials). Linear mixed effects modeling showed lower cortical activation in the auditory cortex in the ASD group in response to jump trials, relative to the TD group. Additionally, functional connectivity analyses showed higher alpha-band functional connectivity in the ASD group between left auditory cortex seeds and right prefrontal and left parietal regions known to be recruited during auditory spatial attention. Right prefrontal alpha-band connectivity estimates were associated with behaviorally assessed auditory processing scores, whereas left parietal connectivity estimates were associated with ASD symptomatology.

However, inconsistent particle size and shape, degradation rates, and unpredictable resorption and excretion of the breakdown products limit their widespread clinical adoption. The present study reports self-degradable, rehydratable, freeze-dried, resorbable Ca2 crosslinked alginate microspheres as a novel vascular embolic agent. The alginate lyase enzyme was incorporated into the alginate microspheres to achieve a controlled degradation rate under physiological conditions. Whilst the feasibility of alginate microspheres as embolic agents has been demonstrated, this is the first study where the controlled release is achieved in physiological conditions. To incorporate the alginate lyase enzyme in the alginate matrix, its activity was reversibly inhibited by preparing an alginate lyase alginate excipient mixture in a pH 3.6 to 3.9 buffered solution. An electrostatic encapsulator enabled the scalable preparation of microspheres of size around 210 at room temperature. The results showed that freeze-dried microspheres regained their shape and size within two minutes after reconstitution with saline, along with active alginate lyase. The reperfusion time of alginate microspheres was evaluated using digital subtraction angiography DSA and compared with imipenem and celestine IMPCS in a porcine renal arterial embolisation model. It was observed that most of the blood vessels reperfused within 130 to 210 minutes, and complete vascular blush was recovered within 24 hours. Embolization with resorbable alginate microspheres induced recoverable ischemic necrosis in the targeted renal arteries. This unique feature of resorbable alginate microspheres in inducing ischemic necrosis, potentially in pain propagating neovessels, makes it an ideal candidate embolic agent for treating MSK associated pain using the TAE technique.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

We show that, correspondingly, visual perturbations alter navigational behavior that relies on head-direction computation. Finally, we find that head-direction representation and the slow phase of reflexive eye movement are tightly correlated, and we propose a theoretical model that elucidates their emergence from coupled visual and vestibular processes. Our results suggest that the brain's estimate of head direction is built on an oculomotor reflex pathway driven by both visual and vestibular signals.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we assess changes in the interaction milieu of common bird communities in France. We estimate associated species pairs using spatial and temporal information for 109 species monitored across 1,969 sites during 17 years. We validate the ecological significance of associated species pairs by testing the relationship between the propensity to be associated and species functional proximity or shared habitat preference. We reconstruct association networks for these intra-guild bird communities and track temporal changes in network layout in terms of size, density of links, modularity and degree distribution. We show that, beyond changes usually documented based on species numbers and abundances, the interaction milieu is also changing non-randomly. Communities become smaller with a similar relative number of associations that becomes unevenly distributed through time. These structural changes vary among bird communities according to their habitat and may impact community functioning and how communities can cope with global change.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Reproductive isolation can be generated by different mechanisms that have been extensively characterized, yet how their interactions affect speciation remains largely unknown. Here, we explicitly model the interaction of three key mechanisms (local adaptation, mate choice and genetic hybrid incompatibilities) quantifying their relative contribution to the evolution of reproductive isolation. We modeled two populations exchanging migrants using Fisher's Geometric Model for local adaptation, phenotype matching for mate choice, and multiple pairs of Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller Incompatibilities (DMI). All three mechanisms were determined by the same set of loci, creating conditions for interactions between barriers both at the genetic and population levels. We found very few cases where the three barriers evolved together. Instead, two barriers could evolve depending on the migration rate: either local adaptation and genetic incompatibilities for limited migration, or local adaptation and mate choice for higher migration. Our results showed that local adaptation due to ecological differentiation was the first to evolve and by far the most effective reproductive barrier. Finally, we demonstrated that in a polygenic model, populations could become locally adapted and evolve strict mate choice, yet they would not accumulate incompatibilities provided that there was sufficient gene flow.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

In the presence of oxygen, PHD2 hydroxylates one or both conserved prolines in the oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD) of HIF subunits, sufficiently marking HIF for binding and ubiquitylation via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. However, prolyl-hydroxylation in the C-terminal ODD appears to be the predominant and sufficient event in triggering the oxygen-dependent destruction of HIFa, rendering the biological significance of N-terminal ODD proline unclear. Here, we examined 7 disease-associated EGLN1 mutations scattered across the catalytic core and show definitively that all PHD2 mutants have a structural and/or catalytic activity defect as measured by time-resolved nuclear magnetic resonance.

However, the adoption of new technologies, particularly in clinical or diagnostic contexts, requires careful validation to identify potential technical and computational limitations. We present TARPON (Telomere Analysis and Research Pipeline Optimized for Nanopore), a best-practices Nextflow pipeline designed for the analysis of telomeres sequenced on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform. TARPON can be executed via the command line or integrated into ONT's EPI2ME agent, providing a user-friendly graphical interface for those without computational training. Nextflow's container-based architecture eliminates dependency conflicts, streamlining deployment across platforms. TARPON isolates telomeric repeat-containing reads, assigns strand specificity, and identifies enrichment probes that can be used both for demultiplexing and for confirming capture-based library preparation. To ensure that the analysis is restricted to full-length telomeres, reads lacking a capture probe or adjacent non-telomeric sequence on the opposite end are excluded. A sliding-window approach defines the subtelomere-telomere boundary, followed by quality filtering to remove low-quality or subtelomeric reads that passed earlier steps. The pipeline outputs customizable statistics, text-based summaries, and publication-ready visualizations (HTML, PNG, PDF). While default settings are optimized for diagnostic workflows, all parameters are easily adjustable via the GUI or command line to support diverse applications. These include telomere analyses in variant-rich samples (e.g., ALT-positive tumors) and organisms with non-canonical telomeric repeats such as insects (GTTAG) and plants (GGTTTAG).

This study proposes a musical interface for real-time fMRI neurofeedback that is adaptable to diverse experimental paradigms, namely the ones aiming at improving mood and other affective dimensions. Using a previously developed motor imagery connectivity-based approach, we evaluate its feasibility and efficacy by comparing the modulation of bilateral premotor cortex (PMC) activity during functional runs with real versus sham (random) feedback in 22 healthy adults. We also assess its performance against a visual feedback interface. The experiment involves a 50-minute MRI session, including anatomical scans, a PMC functional localizer run, and four neurofeedback runs (two with active feedback and two with sham feedback). Pre- and post-session questionnaires assess the neurobehavioral impact on mood, musical background (as a potential predictor of NF success), and subjective feedback experiences. During neurofeedback, participants perform motor imagery of finger-tapping, with feedback delivered as a dynamic, pre-validated chord progression that evolves or regresses based on the functional connectivity between left and right PMC. We found that our implementation of music-based feedback was successful, with participants managing to modulate their own connectivity using the proposed interface. The modulation performance was similar for active and sham NF runs, possibly due to the power of music to boost neuromodulation, but the network recruitment was stronger for active NF, including in the insula, putamen, and target ROIs. Behaviorally, we found a decrease in tension and an improvement in the overall mood of the participants after the session. When comparing our results to previous NF data with a visual interface, we found stronger brain activations, in particular in NF-relevant regions such as the insula and the putamen.

However, it is not clear if individual differences in fear responses exist and, if so, what parts of the brain may underlie such differences. To probe these questions, we developed a contextual fear conditioning paradigm for zebrafish that uses conspecific alarm substance (CAS) as an unconditioned stimulus where fish associate CAS administration with a specific tank. To identify individual differences, we collected behavioral responses from over 300 fish from four different strains (AB, TU, TL, and WIK) and both sexes. We found that fear memory behavior fell into four distinct groups: non-reactive, evaders, evading freezers, and freezers. We also found that background strain and sex influenced how fish respond to CAS, with males more likely to increase evasive behaviors than females and the TU strain more likely to be non-reactive. Finally, we performed whole-brain activity mapping to identify the brain regions that are associated with different behavioral responses. All groups exposed to the tank had strong engagement of the telencephalon, whereas regions beyond the telencephalon distinguished behavioral groups: animals that have high levels of freezing, but low levels of evasion, uniquely engage the cerebellum, preglomerular nuclei, and pretectal areas, whereas those fish that mix evasion with freezing engage the preoptic and hypothalamic areas. Taken together, these findings reveal that zebrafish exhibit individual differences in fear memory expression that are supported at the neural level by extra-telencephalic regions.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Among current strategies to improve brain drug exposure, hijacking physiological pathways involved in receptor-mediated transcytosis (RMT) has emerged as a promising strategy. While targeting transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) is widely explored, many TfR1- antibodies lack cross-species reactivity, limiting translational development. In the present study, we identified and characterized camelid-derived single-domain antibodies (VHHs) with robust cross-reactivity to rodent, rhesus monkey, and human TfR1. Epitope mapping of the VHH revealed a novel binding site at the interface of the TfR1 dimer. When fused to a human IgG1 Fc domain, these VHHs, as monomers or homodimers, were efficiently internalized by engineered CHO cells and brain endothelial cells expressing TfR1 from different species. Systemic administration of VHH-Fc constructs in mice demonstrated significantly improved brain uptake compared to irrelevant controls. Functional delivery was confirmed using neurotensin (NT)-induced hypothermia, and we established correlations between in vivo effects and TfR1 VHH binding properties determined by surface plasmon resonance. Notably, efficient BBB transcytosis was associated with intermediate affinity and rapid dissociation rates. Engineered variants maintained favorable cross-species binding, including similar affinities to human and non-human primate TfR1, facilitating translational studies. The cross-reactive anti-TfR1 VHHs we developed offer a versatile and modular platform for CNS drug delivery and hold promise as molecular shuttles for transporting therapeutic agents across the BBB.

Reports vary widely on the actual specificity of this targeting, with some studies observing 60% of gRNAs possessing no activity against the genome, yet an assumption that inactive gRNAs are rare persists in the E. coli community. To resolve these contradictions, we evaluated the activity of nearly 500,000 unique gRNAs in the E. coli K12 MG1655 genome. We show that the overwhelming majority (at least 93%) of unique gRNAs are functional while only 0.3% are nonfunctional.These nonfunctional gRNAs exhibit strong spacer self-interaction, which can be either excluded using a simple design rule or \"repaired\" during library design. Finally, this work provides the greater microbial synthetic biology community both a set of nearly half a million E. coli gRNAs that have been empirically evaluated in vivo as well as a thoroughly evaluated experimental procedure, complete with appropriate controls for Cas9 activity, for conducting Cas9 assays in E. coli specifically and bacteria more generally", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

F.; Brysbaert, G.", "abstract": "Massive sampling with AlphaFold2 has become a widely used approach in protein structure prediction. Here we present the MassiveFold CASP16-CAPRI dataset, a systematic, large-scale sampling of both monomeric and multimeric protein targets. By exploiting maximal parallelization, we produced up to 8,040 models per target and shared them with the community for collaborative selection and scoring. This collective effort minimizes redundant computation and environmental impact, while granting resource-limited groups - especially those focused on scoring - access to high quality structures. In our analysis, we define an interface-difficulty classification based on DockQ metrics, showing that massive sampling yields the greatest gains on most of the challenging interfaces. Crucially, this classification can be predicted from the median ipTM scores of a routine AF2 run, enabling users to selectively deploy massive sampling only when it is most needed. Combined with a reduction of the massive sampling from 8,040 to 2,475 predictions, such targeted strategies dramatically cut computation time and resource use with minimal loss of accuracy. Finally, we underscore the persistent challenge of choosing optimal models from massive sampling datasets, emphasising the need for more robust scoring methods.

A.", "abstract": "The medial nucleus accumbens shell (medNAcSh) is increasingly recognized as a key node in the regulation of hedonic feeding, exerting strong control over reward consumption through its projections to downstream structures. Recent studies showed that one of the primary cellular mediators of these effects are dopamine 1 receptor positive striatal projection neurons (D1-SPNs). Specifically, population D1-SPN activity gets inhibited during reward consumption and such inhibition is necessary and sufficient to authorize reward consumption, independent of metabolic need. Anatomically, the medNAcSh spans a 1.5 mm distance along the rostro-caudal axis in mice and previous studies have reported functional gradients along this axis in behavioral control. For instance, classical pharmacological studies have suggested that rostral rather than caudal medNAcSh regulates appetitive behavior. However, the cellular, circuit, and molecular mechanisms underlying this topographical gradient remain unknown. Here we hypothesized that D1-SPNs contribute to this gradient by regulating hedonic feeding via a specific hotspot in the rostral medNAcSh. Using population level calcium monitoring with fiber photometry in mice, we show that rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs demonstrate inhibitory responses during reward consumption, while caudal D1-SPNs do not. Consistently, optogenetic stimulation of rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs inhibits consumption, while stimulation of caudal D1-SPNs had minimal effects, confirming the existence of a functional rostro-caudal gradient. Importantly, we observed no differences between rostral and caudal D1-SPNs in their behavioral or activity responses to aversive stimuli, suggesting that the D1-SPN gradient is specific to appetitive contexts. To investigate potential molecular correlates of this functional gradient, we leveraged open-source anatomy datasets and performed fluorescent in situ hybridization, identifying Stard5 and Peg10 as markers enriched in the rostral and caudal medNAcSh, respectively. Finally, we developed a novel Stard5-Flp driver mouse line, which allowed us to target the rostral hotspot selectively. We demonstrated that Stard5+ neurons recapitulate activity patterns of rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs. Together, these findings establish a spatially confined rostral subregion of the medNAcSh as a critical regulator of reward consumption and introduce Stard5 as a molecular tool for its manipulation - offering new opportunities for intervention in dysregulated eating beyond classical homeostatic circuits.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are short noncoding RNAs that individually can negatively regulate dozens of protein-coding transcripts. Previously, we reported that central injection of antisense oligonucleotides targeting microRNA-134 (Ant-134) shortly after status epilepticus potently suppressed the development of recurrent spontaneous seizures in rodent models of temporal lobe epilepsy. The mechanism(s) of these anti-seizure effects remain, however, incompletely understood. Here we show that intracerebroventricular microinjection of Ant-134 in male mice with pre-existing epilepsy caused by intraamygdala kainic acid-induced status epilepticus potently reduces the occurrence of spontaneous seizures. Recordings from ex vivo brain slices collected 2-4 days after Ant-134 injection in epileptic mice, detected a number of electrophysiological phenotypic changes consistent with reduced excitability. Specifically, Ant-134 reduced action potential bursts after current injection in CA1 neurons and reduced miniature excitatory post-synaptic current frequencies in CA1 neurons. Ant-134 also reduced general network excitability, including attenuating pro-excitatory CA1 responses to Schaffer collateral stimulation in hippocampal slices from epileptic mice. Together, the present study demonstrates inhibiting miR-134 reduces single neuron and network hyperexcitability in mice and extends support for this approach to treat drug-resistant epilepsies.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

The role of centromere clustering in driving large-scale changes in structural and functional chromatin assembly remains unclear. Here, using Hi-C and super-resolution microscopy, we show that cell cycle-dependent centromere declustering and clustering states in Cryptococcus neoformans drive global changes in the 3D genome architecture. Centromeres and telomeres are scattered around the nuclear periphery at interphaseG1, and this arrangement constrains the inter-arm interactions within a chromosome, providing a unique interphaseG1 chromosome organization. Moreover, centromeres and telomeres are organized as compartments, segregating them from active euchromatic regions. Polymer modeling reveals that the transition from the unclustered to clustered centromere state during the cell cycle involves changes from a globular to an elongated chromosome architecture. Strikingly, while clustered centromeres replicate early in most yeasts, C. neoformans centromeres replicate late in S-phase, hinting a possible link between centromere clustering dynamics and CEN DNA replication timing. Overall, our study uncovers several unique organizational principles governing the dynamic genome architecture in an evolutionarily diverged basidiomycete yeast.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

During weeks of cold exposure, FLC transcription is progressively reduced both by transcriptional repression mediated by FLC antisense transcription, and epigenetic silencing implemented through a Polycomb-mediated epigenetic switch. In the warm, FLC is transcriptionally repressed by coordinated changes in transcription initiation and RNA PolII speed in a mechanism involving proximal termination. Whether similar mechanisms contribute to the cold-induced FLC transcriptional repression is unknown. Here, we combine mathematical modelling and transcription profiling to investigate FLC transcriptional changes during the cold. We find different dynamics of spliced and unspliced transcripts during cold exposure with only a small change in PolII speed. We also show that, unlike short-term cold, long-term cold temperatures drive an increase in splicing rates while simultaneously reducing productive transcription at FLC. This process is influenced by antisense COOLAIR transcription but does not rely on proximal COOLAIR termination. Cold-induced transcriptional repression of FLC thus involves a decoupling of changes in productive transcription initiation from PolII speed and rates of co-transcriptional splicing, a different mechanism to that repressing FLC in the warm.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

IT delivery of DT reduced Treg frequencies in the tumor, which promoted potent tumor control without autoimmunity. Interestingly, this control was principally mediated by CD4+ T cells, whereas CD8+ T cells only contributed when CD4+ T cells were absent. While conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) were required to clear tumors, Batf3+ cDC1s were dispensable. Distant secondary tumors, mimicking metastases, were also controlled by IT Treg ablation. Mechanistically, IT Tregs suppressed antitumor T cell responses by blocking the acquisition of tumor antigen by cDC2s.

Structurally homologous to mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF), CDNF has been shown to interact with ER-localized chaperone BiP. The ER plays a crucial role in protein synthesis, folding, and quality control, with BiP being a key player in maintaining protein homeostasis. CDNF is protective against ER stress and involved in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling and interaction with BiP. Recent studies have shown that CDNF interacts with UPR sensor proteins PERK, IRE1, and ATF6, suggesting an overlap in CDNF binding with UPR sensors and BiP. In rodent models of Parkinson's disease (PD), CDNF protects and restores the function of brain dopamine neurons and was successful in PD phase 1 clinical studies. CDNF has shown therapeutic potential for several neurological diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and ischemic stroke. Despite extensive knowledge on CDNF's impact on cellular function and neuronal degeneration, its detailed molecular mechanism of action in the ER remains unclear. Here, we have characterized the CDNF interaction with BiP both structurally and functionally and solved the crystal structures of CDNF-BiP complexes to 1.5 [A] resolution, complemented with molecular dynamics simulations. Results show CDNF's role as an antagonist of BiP nucleotide exchange, and thus in its chaperone function, binding to the ADP-bound state.

Nearly all published models to date are based on cross-sectional data, limiting their ability to predict longitudinal change. Here, we used longitudinal brain data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, comprising cortical thickness measures from 180 regions per hemisphere in youths at baseline (N=6179; 47% females), 2-year (N=6179; 47% females), and 4-year (N=805; 45% females) follow-up. A training set was established from baseline and 2-year follow-up data (N=5374; 47% females), while data from individuals with all three time points available served as an independent test set (N=805; 45% females). We developed sex-specific Baseline-Integrated Norms (B-Norms) that predict brain region thickness at follow-up based on baseline thickness, baseline age, and follow-up age, and compared them to sex-specific standard Cross-Sectional Norms (C-Norms) based on age alone. Out-of-sample testing in 2-year and 4-year follow-up data showed that B-Norms consistently provided better fits than C-Norms for nearly all cortical regions. Explained variance was higher in B-Norms than in C-Norms. We found no significant differences between time points (p = 0.45). Repeated measures ANOVA revealed differences in higher-order moments (e.g., skewness and kurtosis) for both models; for example, skewness varied by model, sex, time point, and their interactions. While improved fit alone does not necessarily indicate a superior normative model - since normative models aim to capture population variance rather than simply optimize fit - we demonstrated that four regions were associated with pubertal changes in B-Norms but not in C-Norms, suggesting enhanced sensitivity of B-Norms to developmental processes.

We examined multiple CUD-related phenotypes that captured acquisition of self-administration, escalation of intake, and compulsive-like responding.\n\nResultsConsistent with the existing literature, these traits were phenotypically and genetically correlated and exhibited modest heritability (h2 = 0.07 - 0.16). We identified six genome-wide significant associations. One locus on chromosome 19 was associated with the variable time between cocaine infusions (post infusion interval) and contains several carboxylesterase genes that are orthologous to the human CES1 gene; notably, carboxylesterases metabolize cocaine. Three non-synonymous coding variants in the genes Ces1c and Ces1d were in perfect linkage disequilibrium with this locus, suggesting that one or more of them might be the causal SNP. The other 5 loci also contained promising coding and expression variants, including Trak2, a gene previously associated with CUD in human GWAS and Slc10a7, Plcl1, and Satb2 which have been associated with alcohol and tobacco use disorder.\n\nConclusionsThis is the largest genetic study of cocaine self-administration ever conducted in any species.

In the developing adrenal gland, we uncover a neurovascular mechanism that actively establishes and preserves compartment boundaries between cortex and medulla. Peripheral nerves secrete Semaphorin3C, signaling through PlexinD1 on endothelial cells to locally antagonize VEGF-driven angiogenesis from cortical cells, sculpting distinct vascular domains that guide hormone-producing cells to their correct territories. Disruption of this balance --via denervation or loss of Semaphorin3C-PlexinD1 signaling--leads to ectopic vascularization of the medulla, which adopts a cortex-like vascular network. This vascular remodeling enables cortical cells invasion of medullary territories, blurring compartment boundaries and triggering a phagocytic macrophage response that reflects pathological hijacking of a postnatal morphogenesis program.

Here I describe a simple model-free approach for genealogical inference along the genome from unphased genotype data called Sequential Tree Inference by Collecting Compatible Sites (sticcs). sticcs applies a heuristic algorithm based on the perfect phylogeny principle to reconstruct a local genealogy at each variant site in the genome, using a collecting procedure to import information from other nearby sites. Using simulations, I show that sticcs is accurate for ARG inference, but only when the sample size is small. However, I also describe how it can be applied for the purpose of topology weighting by stacking tree sequences inferred for multiple subsets of the data, removing the sample size restriction. Topology weights estimated in this way from unphased data tend to be more accurate than those computed with full ARGs inferred from perfectly phased data using several popular tools. The methods presented therefore have promise for analysis of relatedness and introgression in non-model species, including polyploids. The new methods are implemented in two Python packages, sticcs (for ARG inference) and twisst2 (for topology weighting using the stacking procedure), which both interface with the tskit library for analysis of tree sequence objects.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Fasciola (liver fluke) are parasitic flatworms that impose a significant burden on the agri-food industry and human health. Immature worms can cause severe damage to the liver as they migrate towards the bile ducts, and yet there is only a single drug to treat this pathogenic life stage, driving the need to identify targets for novel flukicides. Given their crucial role in the growth/development of immature Fasciola hepatica, neoblast-like stem cells are an attractive source of new flukicide targets. Kinases are a hugely diverse group of phosphorylating enzymes with key roles in almost all cellular processes. Kinase dysregulation can result in the development of cancerous cells/tissues, linking many to cell cycle-associated proliferation and growth. Here, we annotate the F. hepatica kinome, identifying 271 putative protein kinases, representing around 1.6% of predicted F. hepatica protein-coding genes with family proportions similar to those of other parasitic flatworms. Many of these kinases, such as polo-like kinase 1 (fhplk1), are upregulated in immature worms undergoing rapid growth and development, a process underpinned by the proliferation of neoblast-like stem cells. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of fhplk1 in juvenile liver fluke reduced growth and cell proliferation, suggesting a conserved role within the cell-cycle; the cessation of stem cell proliferation persisted for at least a week following fhplk1-RNAi. A PLK inhibitor (BI 2536) was shown to phenocopy the fhplk1-RNAi phenotype in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the feasibility of targeting F. hepatica neoblast-like cells through kinase inhibitors. Transcriptomic analysis of fhplk1-RNAi juveniles revealed 946 downregulated genes, principally associated with the cell cycle or ribosomes. Over 80 of these downregulated genes were also downregulated following juvenile F. hepatica irradiation, supporting roles for these kinases in neoblast-like stem cells, and marking them as putative targets for control. Among the 1244 upregulated genes in fhplk1-RNAi juvenile worms were many neurotransmitters, receptors and ion channels, exposing the apparent upregulation of diverse inter-cellular signalling systems. While many neurotransmitter pathways promote proliferation in mammalian systems the interaction between neoblast-like stem cells and neuronal signalling in parasitic flatworms remains elusive. Here, the transcriptomic response offhplk1-RNAi juveniles supports a link between neoblast-like stem cell driven growth/development and neuronal signalling.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Yet, the spatial and temporal dynamics of infestations, species composition, and interactions with natural parasitoids remain poorly understood. Here, we present a long-term, multi-site studies of Protocalliphora infestations in 2,673 Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor) nests, based on 16 years of data (2004-2019) collected across a 10,200-squared-km gradient of agricultural intensity in southern Quebec, Canada. We found that Protocalliphora infestation prevalence and load (number of puparia) in Tree Swallow nests, varied markedly across space and time, with cyclical patterns emerging at approximately 75% of sites. This suggests the influence of both regional and local processes. Probability of hyperparasitism of Protocalliphora puparia by Nasonia parasitoid wasps was high but variable (min ~48%; max ~90%; mean ~70%), likely contributing to the observed temporal oscillations in Protocalliphora prevalence and load. We also documented substantial interannual shifts in the relative abundance of three Protocalliphora species (P. bennetti, P. metallica, P. sialia), emphasizing the importance of species-level resolution in ecological studies of parasitism. Morphometric analyses revealed considerable overlap in puparia size among species, challenging the utility of traditional diagnostic traits for species identification. Finally, we report the first field estimates of Nasonia dormancy and/or mortality within hosts, which were observed in 3% to 16% of Protocalliphora puparia depending on year.

Although many parallels have been drawn between human and animal collective decisions, collective human behavior is rarely studied in the type of embodied scenarios that animals are often faced with. In this study, we placed human groups in a virtual setup similar to nest site selection in social animals, in which they explored a shared environment and reached a consensus based on their observations of empirical features. In groups of up to 10, participants had to reach consensus on the empirically largest of four candidate sites without verbal communication, instead using movement-based interactions in a custom-developed 3D virtual environment for online multi-participant experiments. The results showed that the speed and accuracy of consensus was importantly modulated by perceptual difficulty and information availability, but that no speed-accuracy trade-off was present. Participants attempted to reach consensus on the empirically largest site by flexibly adapting their use of social information to perceptual difficulty, their spatial position, and the time already spent supporting some option. When a minority of informed individuals were present, these individuals exercised greater independence and influenced the group to faster and more accurate consensus.

However, the mechanisms underlying this non-canonical landscape remain elusive. Here we report BAP1, a core component of the Polycomb Repressive-Deubiquitinase (PR-DUB) complex, as a key negative regulator of Polycomb activity during oogenesis. BAP1 restricts pervasive H2AK119ub1 accumulation in oocytes and protects oocyte-specific broad H3K27ac, particularly within gene-poor regions, from ectopic H3K27me3 deposition. While PR-DUB has been linked to gene repression, in oocytes BAP1 primarily promotes transcription and contributes minimally to Polycomb-mediated silencing. BAP1-dependent transcriptional activation is essential for oocyte developmental competence and female fertility. BAP1 loss disrupts the maternal-to-zygotic transition and impairs embryonic enhancer activation, ultimately compromising preimplantation development. Notably, while H3K27ac patterns are reset after fertilization, the aberrant H3K27me3 landscape established in BAP1-deficient oocytes persists in early embryos. Together, these findings reveal a critical role for PR-DUB in safeguarding the oocyte epigenome by protecting euchromatin from ectopic Polycomb activity, rather than enforcing transcriptional repression.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

However, natural stimuli can move in any direction, and it remains unclear whether intermediate directions are encoded less effectively, or whether this cardinal organization nevertheless supports uniform direction encoding. Here, we combined previous electrophysiological recordings with an information-theoretic measure, the Stimulus Specific Information, to estimate the directional sensitivity of small populations of recorded neurons. This analysis revealed that DS RGC populations are uniformly sensitive across all directions of motion. We then asked whether the observed homogeneous sensitivity was a consequence of DS RGCs maximizing the average stimulus information.

Here we combine two-photon calcium imaging, optogenetics and circuit modelling to investigate how locomotion adjusts adaptation in layer 2/3 of mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We show that this change in state preferentially increases gain in PCs that sensitize during a high-contrast visual stimulus, while having weaker effects on PCs that depress. A population model constrained by a number of optogenetic manipulations accounts for the differential modulation of PCs during locomotion on the basis of i) variations in the connections that individual PCs receive from PV and SST interneurons, ii) a broad weakening of PC and PV synapses to all local targets, and iii) enhanced inhibition from SST synapses targetting depressing PCs. These results provide a quantitative and integrated understanding of how state-dependent modulation of cortical circuits can selectively bias cortical computation toward different adaptive regimes.

Methods BMSCs and RAW264.7 cells were fused through transient transfection using the COVID-19 spike glycoprotein and human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), respectively. The resulting hybrids were purified using magnetic sorting, and their characteristics were evaluated by examining morphology, glucose uptake rates, phagocytic capacity, cytoskeletal morphology, and the levels of Fc{gamma} receptors, as well as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, adhesion, and complement inhibitory factors. The IgG clearance capability of the hybrids was assessed by measuring internalization efficiency and infiltration into renal organoids. Additionally, the reparative effects of the hybrids were evaluated using doxorubicin-treated MPC5 damage models. Live cell imaging techniques were employed to investigate the interactions between the hybrids and immature dendritic cells (iDCs). Hybrid-derived nanovesicles were isolated, and their abilities to target IgG and clear IL-6 were evaluated using immunofluorescence and ELISA. Furthermore, chloroplasts and C-dots were co-incubated with the hybrids, and their benefits were assessed by measuring cell viability, oxygen content, ROS levels, mitochondrial function, and the levels of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and pro-repair factors. A scratch assay was conducted to determine the impact of chloroplast transplantation on the migration ability of 3T3 cells. Results High-purity hybrids were successfully produced that cleared IgG while maintaining their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. They promoted the recovery of podocyte injury through vesicular and mitochondrial delivery, as well as efferocytosis. Furthermore, the hybrids inhibited iDCs primarily through migrasomes, intercellular nanomicrotubule connections, and phagocytosis. The derived nanovesicles were capable of residing in IgG-enriched regions and adsorbing IL-6. Interestingly, the transplanted chloroplasts enabled the hybrids to utilize light energy to enhance their antioxidant capacity and promote the migration of 3T3 cells, which contributes to wound repair. Subsequently, the loading of C-dots was beneficial for enhancing resistance to oxidative damage. Conclusions Our results suggest that hybrids-mediated therapy is a new and creative therapeutic approach for managing immune-mediated nephropathies.Hybrids demonstrated effective immunomodulatory and promoted injury recovery. The derived nanovesicles have the potential to alleviate the inflammatory burden at sites of antibody immune complex deposition. Additionally, the incorporation of chloroplasts and C-dots enhanced the hybrids' adaptability to ischemic-hypoxic microenvironments.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we applied multiscale fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to human cell lines engineered for single or double depletion of condensin II and cohesin, and examined their functional interplay at two distinct stages of the cell cycle. Our results demonstrate that a functional \"handover\" from condensin II to cohesin during the mitosis-to-G1 transition is critical for establishing chromosome territories (CTs) in the newly assembling nucleus. During G2 phase, condensin II and cohesin cooperate to maintain global CT morphology, although they act at different genomic scales. Strikingly, double depletion of both complexes causes CTs to collapse and accumulate abnormally at the nucleolar periphery. Based on these findings, we will discuss how the condensin and cohesin complexes act in an orderly and cooperative manner to orchestrate chromatin dynamics across genomic scales, thereby supporting higher-order chromosome organization throughout the cell cycle.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

In response to cellular cues, lipid droplets are formed at the INM, which plays a key role in membrane homeostasis and energy storage. However, the signaling pathway that regulates the formation of nuclear lipid droplets remains to be elucidated. Here we show that in budding yeast, the INM-localized protein Csa1 regulates the nuclear localization of the acyltransferase Lro1, which converts diacylglycerol to triacylglycerol, leading to lipid droplet formation. Csa1 harbors a bipartite nuclear localization signal for nuclear sorting, along with an amphipathic helix that anchors it to the INM. Upon nutrient depletion and at the onset of meiosis, both Csa1 and Lro1 are enriched at a distinct INM subdomain that abuts the nucleolus, which we term the n-INM. We show that Csa1 is essential for targeting Lro1 to the n-INM region. In the absence of Csa1, Lro1 is dispersed along the nuclear periphery. The deacetylase activity of Sir2 is required for the n-INM enrichment of both Csa1 and Lro1. In the absence of either Csa1 or Sir2, lipid droplet formation is compromised. Our findings uncover an unexpected Sir2-dependent Csa1-Lro1 signaling pathway at the INM that regulates lipid droplet biogenesis and nuclear envelope remodeling.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

As a first line of defence they fulfill effector functions and immune modulatory properties. Upon activation they release pro-inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and proteases. It has been suggested that MCs may contribute to the development of liver fibrosis. However, investigating hepatic MC biology in mice is challenging due to low MC numbers and a lack of suitable detection techniques relying on MC proteins and their modifications. Here, we evaluated whether the expression strength of MC markers correlates with the degree of liver fibrosis in mice and aimed to determine the frequency and localization of hepatic MCs. We applied both a toxic (DEN/CCl4 treatment) and a genetic (Mdr2-/- mice) liver fibrosis model in C57BL/6 mice and found a significant correlation between fibrosis grade and the expression of several established mast cell markers. This correlation was further supported in patients with fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using publicly available transcriptomics datasets. We used FACS to purify and isolate MCs from fibrotic mouse livers and verified MC signatures by qPCR analysis of MC-specific gene expression. Hepatic MCs were predominantly negative for Mast-Cell-Protease 5 (Mcpt5) and occurred at a low frequency (approximately 1-2% of leukocytes). Using Molecular CartographyTM of fibrotic liver sections, we determined the spatial localization, expression signature, abundance (approximately 2 cells/mm2) and cellular environment of murine hepatic MCs. In summary, we demonstrated the existence of MCs in murine fibrotic livers and defined an MC expression signature that correlates with the strength of liver fibrosis. These findings will help to study MC biology in murine models of liver disease more effectively in the future.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

How tardigrades can repair widespread DNA damage without producing frequent, large-scale chromosome structural abnormalities, like chromosome translocations and fusions, is unknown. Here, we report the results of examining chromosome and nuclear architecture throughout the cell cycle in early embryos of H. exemplaris. We found that H. exemplaris chromosomes are maintained in an individualized form throughout the cell cycle. We were surprised to also find that each chromosome is housed in a fully or partially separate lamin-lined compartment, instead of all chromosomes being housed in a single, nearly spherical nuclear lamina and envelope. Our results reveal unusual chromosomal and nuclear organization in a tardigrade. We speculate that these unexpected features might limit chromosomal rearrangements during DNA damage repair in extreme conditions.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

In this context, microalgae have emerged as a promising biofactory, producing bioactive compounds for skin health, widely recognized for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-aging activities. To leverage these properties, besides the conventional use of microalgal mass or extracts, the isolation and application of their secretome including in particular the extracellular vesicles named nanoalgosomes emerged as a novel, increasingly studied approach. EVs are membranous nanoparticles released by all cells and naturally efficient in the transport of both endogenous and exogenous bioactive molecules. Their unique biological properties make them ideal candidates for therapeutic and cosmetic applications. Here, we propose nanoalgosomes, as a sustainable and effective solution for innovative dermocosmetic treatments. In this study we exemplify the use of the microalgae Tetraselmis chuii, an edible, green and renewable EV bio-source. We demonstrated the nanoalgosomes skin-health promoting potential, by employing the human skin cells as a model to evidence the nanoalgosome ability to protect the cells from ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation-related damages. Treatment with nanoalgosomes reduced the oxidative stress, enhancing cell viability in a dose dependent manner. Nanoalgosomes also led to a marked decrease in senescence-associated (SA)-beta-galactosidase activity, indicating a reduction in senescence-associated phenotype in UVB-exposed skin cells. Furthermore, we observed that nanoalgosomes effectively modulate melanogenesis in UVB-stimulated melanocytes by downregulating tyrosinase expression, resulting in a significant decrease in melanin content. These findings validate nanoalgosomes not only as photoprotective agents but also as potential modulators of pigmentation processes. Altogether, our results provide a solid foundation for the development of nanoalgosome-based formulations in dermocosmetic applications aimed at UV protection, anti-aging, and depigmentation, supporting the transition toward natural and sustainable skincare solutions.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we examined the hepatic response of young (7-month-old) and old (25-month-old) C57BL/6 male mice to a 9-week high-fat diet (HFD) and assessed whether rapamycin, a well-established pro-longevity intervention, could mitigate age-exacerbated effects. While both age groups developed metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), older mice displayed more severe hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and transcriptional dysregulation. Transcriptomic profiling of whole livers and purified hepatocytes revealed that aging amplifies HFD-induced inflammatory and metabolic gene expression changes, including activation of immune pathways and suppression of metabolic pathways. Notably, treatment of aging mice with rapamycin reversed the majority of HFD-driven transcriptional alterations, including upregulation of pro-inflammatory regulators such as Stat1, and dysregulation of metabolic gene networks. Rapamycin also reduced hepatosteatosis, total body weight, and a tumorigenic transcriptomic signature associated with hepatocellular carcinoma risk.

However, a subgroup of cells that are eliminated do not show EGFR/ERK downregulation, suggesting the involvement of additional mechanisms. Here, we conducted a multi-step RNAi screen in the Drosophila notum and identified 47 diverse regulators of epithelial remodelling. Among them, we focused on two membrane proteins, Hibris (Hbs) and Roughest (Rst), which mediate heterophilic cell adhesion. We show that Hbs and Rst exhibit region-specific expression patterns in the developing notum, showing elevated protein levels in zones of cell survival and reduced expression in regions undergoing cell pruning. Uniform knock-down of hbs and rst or homogenous overexpression of hbs, disrupts normal cell elimination during morphogenesis and results in adult tissue malformations. Remarkably, local suppression of Hbs and Rst in Hbshigh/Rsthigh territories triggers ectopic cell elimination, indicating that a surface code defined by Hbs/Rst can instruct cell removal. We further demonstrate that Hbs, but not Rst, is regulated by compaction-sensitive EGFR signalling, positioning Hbs as a potential integrator of mechanical cues and cell property signals, possibly via its interaction with Rst.

In this study spanning novel pairs of cell line models and data from patients' samples, we used a broad range of methodologies including mass-spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics, ectopic gene expression, RT-qPCR, immunoblotting, cytotoxicity, proliferation, invasion, and migration assays. We found loss of anterior gradient protein 2 (AGR2) to be prognostic for poor overall survival for patients with HER2-overexpressing tumours, in contrast to what has been reported for estrogen-positive breast cancer. Additionally, we discovered that loss of AGR2 is not only associated with neratinb-resistance, but that its restoration by ectopic AGR2 expression in neratinib-resistance cells partly restores their drug sensitivity. Furthermore, we established that keys metastatic phenotypic traits acquired with neratinib-resistance were blocked by ectopic AGR2 expression in the cells. Taken together, our results show that AGR2 has potential as a prognostic biomarker for outcome from HER2- overexpressing cancer; a predictive biomarker for resistance/response to neratinib; and a potential therapeutic protein for helping restore sensitivity to neratinib and overcoming aggressive cellular traits associated with cancer metastasis.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Here we identify Mg2+-protoporphyrin IX (MgPpIX), a Mg-containing tetrapyrrole and intermediate in chlorophyll biosynthesis, as inhibitor of hNaV1.5 (IC50 of 1 nM). The activity profile of various metal protoporphyrins correlates with the electrostatic potential at the metal center of the compounds. MgPpIX is specific to hNaV1.5, as no inhibition of other hNaV isoforms (hNaV1.2, 1.4, 1.7, 1.8) was detected. A mutagenesis study and structural modeling reveals that MgPpIX stabilizes the domain-II voltage sensor in the deactivated conformation, with residues E795 and N803 being relevant determinants. MgPpIX also inhibits native NaV channels in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and colorectal carcinoma SW480 cell lines, and suppresses cell migration.

Cuticles typically comprise a polyester cutin matrix embedded and overlaid with cuticular waxes, but their exact chemical make-up, structure and functions can vary widely depending on the tissue and species. Barley shows two such cuticular specialisations: (1) deposition of a thick beta-diketone-rich wax bloom on multiple organs at reproductive stage, common in other Poeceae species and linked to yield; and, (2) secretion of a sticky layer on the grain fruit (caryopsis) pericarp cuticle which adheres to inner floral hulls, leading to the distinctive covered barley grain used in animal feed and malting. Two SHINE/WAX-INDUCER transcription factors in barley, HvWIN1 and NUD, promote the wax bloom and hull to caryopsis adhesion, respectively, yet little is understood about other genes involved. Leveraging near-isogenic lines of wax-deficient mutants, we identify the barley BODYGUARD1 (HvBDG1) gene encoding an alpha/beta-hydrolase essential for leaf cuticular integrity and wax bloom deposition. Modelling of functional and defective alleles suggests that HvBDG1 N-terminal region control of protein flexibility is important for HvBDG1 function. In addition to their role in controlling barley epicuticular wax deposition, we show that both HvBDG1 and HvWIN1 are essential for strong hull to caryopsis adhesion. Along with NUD, these gene products differentially contribute to ultrastructural changes on the pericarp associated with a cuticular building programme driven by NUD and HvWIN1 regulation of cuticle metabolism and transport and cell wall-related genes, and correlate with shifts in pericarp surface chemistry. We also show that the previously asserted grain-specific role of NUD should be revised, as our findings reveal that it is essential for maintaining leaf cuticle integrity. Our analyses in barley suggest that NUD and HvWIN1 control cuticular specialisations and cuticle integrity in part via promotion of HvBDG1 expression, while HvWIN1 and NUD likely act independently from each other. Lastly, mining tetraploid wheat mutant populations followed by crossing to combine mutated homoeologues demonstrated that BDG1 and WIN1 orthologues also control wax bloom in wheat.

The Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is enriched at various presynaptic terminals, including ribbon synapses, where it associates with synaptic ribbons and thus may contribute to the modulation of Ca2+-dependent NTR. This could arise via its ability to influence one or more steps that control either the Ca2+ signal, the release process, or synaptic vesicle dynamics affecting available pools. Yet, recent studies have yielded conflicting results regarding the ability of CaMKII to influence NTR at rod bipolar cell (RBC) ribbon synapses. To address this, we acutely manipulated CaMKII activity in synaptic terminals of zebrafish RBCs by infusion of either inhibitory peptides targeting CaMKII or CaM, or a constitutively active CaMKII, while using a combination of imaging and electrophysiological approaches. Neither inhibiting nor enhancing CaMKII activity affects presynaptic Ca2+ channel activity. However, capacitance measurements revealed that inhibition of either CaMKII or CaM reduces exocytosis. CaMKII inhibition also reduces synaptic vesicle replenishment. Surprisingly, elevation of CaMKII activity also diminished vesicle fusion, similar to the effect of CaMKII inhibition, suggesting that CaMKII activity naturally exists at optimal levels to support neurotransmitter release. In contrast to CaMKII inhibition, CaMKII activity elevation did not impair vesicle replenishment. Collectively, these data suggest that distinct synaptic vesicle populations are differentially reliant on the level of CaMKII activity.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Here we aimed to determine whether illusory perceptions of visual tilt were sufficient to produce OST. The illusory stimulus was a variation of the Cafe Wall illusion, applied to four \"walls\" to approximate the appearance of a tilted room. In a first experiment we determined the perceived magnitude of tilt of the illusory stimulus using a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task, measuring the amount of tilt required to cancel the perceived illusory tilt for clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) configurations.

In males, this culminates in ejaculation, a precisely timed sequence of organ contractions driven by the concerted activity of interneurons, sensory neurons, and motor neurons. Although central command circuits that trigger copulation have been mapped, the motor architecture and the chemical logic that couple specific neuronal subclasses to organ specific contractility, seminal fluid secretion, and sperm emission remain largely uncharted. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to explain how neural circuits adapt to varying contexts and how their failure contributes to infertility. Here we present an in-depth anatomical and functional analysis of the motor neurons that innervate the internal male reproductive tract of Drosophila melanogaster. We identify two classes of multi-transmitter motor neurons based on neurotransmitter usage, namely octopamine and glutamate neurons (OGNs) and serotonin and glutamate neurons (SGNs), each with a biased pattern of innervation: SGNs predominate in the accessory glands, OGNs in the ejaculatory duct, with equal contributions of each to the seminal vesicles. Both classes co-express vesicular transporters for glutamate (vGlut) and amines (vMAT), confirming their dual chemical identity. Their target organs differentially express receptors for glutamate, octopamine, and serotonin, suggesting combinatorial neuromodulation of contractility. Functional manipulations show that SGNs are essential for male fertility but OGNs are dispensable. Glutamatergic transmission from both classes is also dispensable for fertility. These findings provide the first high-resolution map linking multi-transmitter motor neurons to specific reproductive organs, reveal an unexpected division of labor between serotonergic and octopaminergic signaling pathways, and establish a framework for dissecting conserved neural principles that govern ejaculation and male fertility.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

At 10 Hz, propagation delays increase within seconds, and failures accumulate over time, particularly in distal axonal branches. These effects are negligible at frequencies of 1--4 Hz. We attribute this phenomenon to the gradual and cumulative inactivation of sodium channels at vulnerable sites. Simulations incorporating this mechanism replicate the observed dynamics. Our findings underscore a limit on axonal reliability. To the extent that a sustained (seconds) drive at ca. 10 Hz or higher is physiologically feasible, axons should be regarded as active, heterogeneous structures with context-sensitive excitability.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

V.", "abstract": "All exposed epithelial surfaces, including the walls of internal tubes, are lined by a lipid and glycoprotein-rich apical extracellular matrix (aECM) that helps shape and protect the apical domain. Secreted lipocalins are lipid transporters frequently found within apical compartments. We show that loss of the C. elegans lipocalin LPR-1 disrupts the assembly of another lipocalin, LPR-3, within the pre-cuticle aECM that protects and shapes the narrow excretory duct and pore tubes. LPR-1 is apically secreted and colocalizes with LPR-3 in intracellular vesicles and lysosomes, but unlike LPR-3 it does not detectably incorporate into the aECM. Forward genetic screens for lpr-1 suppressors identified mutations in scav-2, which encodes a transmembrane protein of the CD36 scavenger receptor B family. Loss of scav-2 restored LPR-3 matrix localization and suppressed the lpr-1 tube shaping defect, as well as the tube-shaping defects of a subset of pre-cuticle mutants, but not lpr-3 mutants. A SCAV-2 fusion accumulated at apical surfaces of interfacial epithelial tubes, including the excretory duct and pore, and both tissue-specific suppression of lpr-1 matrix defects and tissue-specific rescue experiments support a local role for SCAV-2 within these tubes. These data demonstrate that LPR-1 and SCAV-2 have opposing effects on narrow tube integrity by altering the content and organization of that tube's luminal aECM, possibly by acting as transporters of an LPR-3 cofactor. These results have broadly relevant implications regarding the importance of lipocalins and scavenger receptors for aECM organization and integrity of the narrowest tubes in the body.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Surface water CH4 concentrations were orders of magnitude lower than bottom-waters, but were similar between ponds with and without FPV.

Instead, dissolved CH4 patterns could be explained by elevated abundance of methanotrophic bacteria in the water column of FPV ponds, where late-summer abundances exceeded 1,000,000 cells mL-1.

We present a visually rich and extensive library of global, pore-based, and other metrics for analyzing features of porosity in such assemblies. Our library includes over 25 descriptors of '3D pores' that are identified using our LOVAMAP software. By applying our metrics to a set of simulated packings that vary by particle size, shape, and stiffness, we reveal predictable relationships between particle and void space characteristics. We identify two fundamental parameters of a monodisperse particle system - particle diameter ({delta}) and void volume fraction ({phi}) - that govern several void space features, such as the total number of bottlenecks (i.e., doors between pores), the median value of the largest enclosed sphere across all pores in a packing, and the fraction of reaction-center 'hotspots.' Through regression analyses on transformations of {delta} and {phi}, we quantify multiple packing-descriptor relationships, demonstrating, for example, that packing properties scale linearly with the median values of length-based descriptors across assemblies. We further introduce approaches for computing the number of vertices, edges, and faces of 3D pores, allowing for approximation to simpler polyhedra. Additional metrics explore surface entrances into the particle scaffold, traversable paths through the void space, and size-based accessibility. Together, these descriptors, which have been bundled into LOVAMAP, offer new insights into particle-pore architecture and spatial organization.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

However, carboxylic acids must be activated before downstream use, typically requiring ATP, CoA, or reduced ferredoxin to overcome unfavorable thermodynamics. These activators are costly to generate and divert carboxylic acids into CO2-releasing pathways, reducing carbon efficiency. Here, we demonstrate that aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) can directly reduce carboxylic acids to aldehydes without prior activation, a process previously thought to be biologically inaccessible. Screening 133 ALDHs revealed that this activity is remarkably widespread within the protein family, enabling production of aliphatic aldehydes and alcohols, diols, and aromatic alcohols, at titers >1 g/L, in some cases, after optimization of thermodynamic driving forces. Additionally, we applied this system to upgrade waste-derived carboxylic acid effluent streams from wastewater sludge, food waste, and waste gas (CO2). This activation-free process, termed ''reverse aldehyde oxidation'' (rAOX), establishes a broadly applicable, energy-efficient platform for carboxylic acid valorization at 100% carbon yield. Analogous to the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle (rTCA) and reverse {beta}-oxidation (rBOX), rAOX exemplifies that metabolic reactions classically defined as unidirectional may have unexpected plasticity to operate in reverse and open new avenues in biomanufacturing.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

However, there is a lack of models that capture the complex interplay between within-host and between-host evolutionary dynamics, leaving a knowledge gap with regard to realistic evolutionary dynamics as observed within molecular surveillance programs. We present SIMPLICITY, a multi-scale mathematical model that combines within-host disease progression and viral evolution, with a population-level model of virus transmission and immune evasion. We parameterize SIMPLICITY based on SARS-CoV-2 within-host viral dynamics, observed evolutionary rates, as well as dynamics of immune waning. We then apply SIMPLICITY to study the dynamics and mechanisms driving SARS-CoV-2 evolution at the population level. We compare a model of gradually increasing transmission fitness with an adaptive fitness landscape model that accounts for temporal changes in transmission fitness due to infection history and immune waning in the population. Our simulations demonstrate that escape from population immunity generates evolutionary dynamics encompassing selective sweeps, which resembles actual SARS-CoV-2 evolution. To the contrary, the model of gradual fitness fails to resemble realistic SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary dynamics. Overall, this demonstrates that infection history and immune waning should be considered in models of viral fitness, including machine learning approaches. In short, SIMPLICITY can be used to investigate mechanisms driving viral evolution and constitutes a versatile tool for creating synthetic datasets of viral evolution to e.g. benchmark and challenge phylogenetic pipelines used in outbreak investigation.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Redox processes play a pivotal role in bacterial adaptation mechanisms. The cytoplasm of most organisms is recognized for maintaining a reducing environment through thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we have identified an unusual cytoplasmic thioredoxin named Patrx2. What sets Patrx2 apart is its active site, which contains a consensus sequence, CGHC, identical to the characteristic motif of protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) found in eukaryotic cells. Our investigations have unveiled that Patrx2, unlike canonical thioredoxins, exhibits disulfide isomerase activity in vitro and displays physicochemical properties, as well as a structural conformation of its catalytic site, reminiscent of PDIs. Using a mutant transposon library, we found that the expression of patrx2 is regulated by the alternative sigma factor AlgU, which plays a crucial role in the formation of alginate biofilms in P. aeruginosa. We further demonstrated strong patrx2 expression in a mucoid strain we constructed, carrying the clinically relevant mucA22 mutation frequently found in cystic fibrosis patients. Furthermore, our results showed a significant decrease in alginate synthesis in a patrx2 mutant in this mucoid strain, which we attributed to its catalytic activity in a C34S variant. The study of Patrx2, an atypical thioredoxin expressed within an alginate biofilm, underscores the importance of redox regulation in adaptation mechanisms.

Here, we modelled biophysical characteristics of biofilm-linked liquid crystalline droplets formed by Pf4, which predicted that sub-stoichiometric phage binders had the ability to disrupt liquid crystals by changing the surface properties of the phage. We tested this prediction by developing nanobodies targeting the outer surface of the Pf4 phage, which disrupted in vitro reconstituted droplets, promoted antibiotic diffusion into bacteria, disrupted P. aeruginosa biofilm formation under a variety of conditions, and abolished antibiotic tolerance of biofilms. The inhibition strategy illustrated in this study could be extended to biofilms of other pathogenic bacteria, where filamentous molecules are pervasive in the extracellular matrix.

Therefore, using our recently developed SHAN-seq method, we mapped and compared cleavage sites for type II topoisomerases from three different pathogenic bacterial species, Escherichia coli, Bacillus anthracis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the presence of the fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin. We found that the enzymes have substantially different DNA cleavage specificities that vary between gyrase and topoisomerase IV, across species, with supercoil chirality, and in response to ciprofloxacin. Our results demonstrate that bacterial species fine-tune the DNA cleavage specificity of their type II topoisomerases.

The clinical parameters include the deposition of amyloid-beta into senile plaques in the brain parenchyma and in cerebral vessels known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Currently, beta-amyloid-antibodies are emerging as possible therapy for AD. Several biomarkers, such as beta-Amyloid and tau-protein have gained significant value for diagnosing early AD. However, these biomarkers require cerebrospinal fluid. Blood tests for screening of AD are urgently needed. Methods: Patients diagnosed with early AD were analyzed for extracellular amyloid-beta binding to platelets, platelet morphology and platelet activation and compared to age-matched controls. Results: Beside unaltered platelet number and size, we detected increased binding of amyloid-beta to activated platelets isolated from AD patients. Electron microscopy revealed an altered platelet morphology in AD patients including the number of dense granules and the area of the open canalicular system (OCS) as compared to controls. While only minor differences in platelet activation were detected between patients and controls, a significant reduction of integrin alphaIIbbeta3 (fibrinogen receptor) activation was evident in platelets from female compared to male AD patients as determined by flow cytometry. Conclusion: The here presented results emphasize the importance to increase our understanding how platelets contribute to AD pathology in patients in a sex-specific manner. Furthermore, platelet parameters might serve as an ideal biomarker for a first prognosis of AD because platelets can be easily accessed by blood samples.

However, the precise mechanisms by which these GTPases support HIV-1 assembly and release remain incompletely understood. Here, we provide direct evidence that Arf1 and Arf6 are required for efficient trafficking of the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein, assembly, and virion release. Perturbation of Arf1 function with either a GTP-locked (Q71L) or GDP-locked (T31N) mutant significantly reduced virus release, impaired Gag association with membrane compartments, and blocked Gag targeting to the plasma membrane. Manipulation of Arf1 activity via the GTPase-activating protein AGAP1 further demonstrated that dynamic cycling of Arf1 between GTP- and GDP-bound states is essential for productive Gag trafficking. Similarly, expression of a constitutively active Arf6 mutant (Q67L) misdirected Gag to intracellular membranes and markedly decreased virion production. Importantly, disruption of Arf1 or Arf6 function did not affect the total expression, surface levels, or intracellular distribution of the host restriction factor BST-2.

We identified genes encoding a predicted nuclease paired with a trypsin-like protease repeatedly acquired by multiple, otherwise unrelated antiviral immune systems in bacteria. Cell-based and biochemical assays revealed the nuclease is a proenzyme that cleaves DNA only after activation by its partner protease. Phylogenetic analysis showed that two distinct immune systems, Hachiman and AVAST, use the same mechanism of proteolytic activation despite their independent evolutionary origins. Examination of nuclease-protease inheritance patterns identified caspase-nuclease (canu) genomic loci that confer antiviral defense in a pathway reminiscent of eukaryotic caspase activation. These results uncover the coordinated activities of pronucleases and their activating proteases within different immune systems and show how coevolution enables defense system innovation.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

B.; Glaunsinger, B.", "abstract": "Cellular stressors often cause widespread repression of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) activity, which is thought to facilitate a focused transcriptional output towards stress resolution. In many cases, however, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that stress-induced downregulation of the general transcription factor TFIIB tunes the expression of specific stress response genes. In response to a variety of stressors, TFIIB is proteolytically cleaved at a conserved aspartic acid residue by caspases 3 and 7. Using both overexpression and endogenous base-editing, we find that B and T cells that are unable to cleave TFIIB fail to appropriately dampen transcription of short, stimulus-responsive and proto-oncogenic genes. The promoters of TFIIB-sensitive genes are bound by TFIIB and RNAP II, although their transcription is restrained until stimulated by stress. Subsequently, their expression is modulated through TFIIB cleavage. We further demonstrate that stress-induced TFIIB cleavage prevents aberrant lymphocyte proliferation and suppresses transcription from a pathogenic gammaherpesvirus. Hence, caspase targeting of TFIIB destabilizes transcription to tune gene expression, allowing for proper stress resolution.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

Conventional CAR-T designs do not integrate into the T-cell receptor (TCR) and rely on non-natural CD3{zeta} signaling. They thus often suffer from tonic signaling, rapid T-cell exhaustion, and antigen escape due to reduced sensitivity. To address these limitations, we explored alternative CAR architectures that take into account the evolutionary optimized TCR signaling machinery. Specifically, we employed T-cell receptor fusion constructs (TRuCs), where a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) targeting the Sialyl-Thomson-Nouveau antigen (STn) is attached to the CD3{varepsilon} subunit. We then systematically screened a library of costimulatory domains and their combinations, fused to the TRuC, using a novel in vitro and in vivo screening approach. This screen identified a potent TRuC variant incorporating both CD28 and CD27 costimulatory domains. This optimized construct exhibited increased in vitro and in vivo proliferation and enhanced 4-1BB and IFN{gamma} expression upon repeated antigen stimulation. It further showed improved antitumor efficacy compared to conventional second-generation CAR-T cells in a mouse melanoma model. Moreover, we validated the adaptability of this approach by targeting B7H3 in a sarcoma model. The TRuC with costimulatory domains again outperformed other CAR-variants. Our findings highlight the potential of incorporating combined CD28 and CD27 costimulatory domains into TCR-based CAR architectures to overcome limitations associated with conventional CAR-T therapy and improve efficacy against solid tumors.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

By incorporating the IgX tailpiece into human IgM, we achieved efficient IgM hexamer formation. Truncating IgM's natural tailpiece to a range of 11-16 residues also substantially enhanced hexamerization efficiency. Furthermore, introducing a shortened IgM tailpiece to IgG resulted in effective IgG hexamer formation. We further show that the engineered IgM and IgG hexamers targeting CD20 demonstrated robust complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against several B lymphoma cells.

However, there is a limited set of antibiotics that are effective against drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One strategy to enhance the efficacy and longevity of existing antibiotics is by combining them with non-traditional antimicrobial adjuvants. Here, we examined if the host-derived antimicrobial lipid sphingosine could enhance the efficacy of a panel of antibiotics against P. aeruginosa in vitro. We found that sphingosine displayed strong synergy with the polymyxin antibiotics, polymyxin B and colistin, to inhibit growth of and kill P. aeruginosa, but did not significantly alter the efficacy of other tested antibiotic classes. The addition of sphingosine reduced the MIC of polymyxin B and colistin from 0.5 g/mL to 0.031 g/mL and 8 g/mL to 0.5 g/mL, respectively. This combination of sphingosine and polymyxin B synergized to inhibit the growth and survival of Klebsiella pneumoniae as well. In addition to sphingosine, we found that the sphingoid bases sphinganine (dihydrosphingosine) and phytosphingosine also enhanced the activity of polymyxins. Overall, these findings demonstrate that sphingosine is a potent adjuvant for polymyxins, and that the sphingosine-polymyxin combination is capable of killing P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae while using relatively low concentrations of polymyxin.

We found substantial genomic diversity among the AMR-positive Salmonella enterica isolates. AMR profiling revealed widespread distribution of resistance genes, with aac(6')-laa_1 present in nearly all genomes, and tet(A), sul2, and fosA7.1 frequently co-occurring. Core virulence genes such as invA, ssaL, and steA were nearly universally conserved, suggesting essential roles in pathogenesis. Sporadic rare virulence genes like papE, tcpC, and ybtP were also present, pointing to lineage-specific patterns. Hierarchical clustering based on core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) revealed monophyletic clades for major serovars such as Enteritidis and Infantis, while broader HC2000 groupings reflected shared evolutionary histories.

J.; Alvira, C. M.", "abstract": "After birth, the alveolar capillary network expands to increase gas exchange surface area and endothelial-derived signals promote alveolarization. Lung capillaries are comprised of two distinct subsets, one with proliferative potential to facilitate growth and repair (Cap1), and the other serving a specialized role in gas exchange (Cap2). However, the molecular mechanisms directing capillary speciation, developmental plasticity, and fate transitions during development and repair are not well understood. Here, we show that Cap2 are absent in late embryonic life but rapidly appear and expand immediately after birth. We show that Cap1 progenitors first transition to a novel, intermediate cell state (CapINT), characterized by co-expression of Cap1 and Cap2 markers, and heightened proliferation. CapINT are present in both the developing mouse and human lung. Hyperoxia, an experimental model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease marked by impaired alveolarization, increases CapINT abundance and persistence and expands Cap2 EC. CapINT EC are also increased in human infants dying with active BPD. Using genetic lineage tracing, single cell transcriptomics, ATAC-sequencing and a mouse model that permits inducible deletion of VEGFR2 in CapINT and Cap2 EC, we show that postnatal abrogation of VEGFR2 markedly increases CapINT EC abundance, blocks Cap2 terminal differentiation, impairs alveolarization, and activates alveolar fibroblasts. Finally, we identify ERG as a putative VEGFR2-downstream mechanism that promotes CapINT to Cap2 differentiation. Taken together, our data show that Cap1-Cap2 differentiation is a two-step process that only requires VEGFR2 for the second step. Elucidation of the physiologic and molecular pathways that control the initial transition of Cap1 to CapINT EC has the potential to reveal new therapeutic targets for lung diseases that disrupt the alveolar capillary formation and integrity.", "date": "2025-07-28", "journal": ""}

We also introduced a structure-derived spatial distance metric, Spatial Proximity to Disease Variants (SPDV), which proved useful for scoring RyR1 variants. Here, we apply EDC and SPDV across thousands of human disease genes. In comparison with 72 variant effect predictors (VEPs), SPDV exceeds or is at least as effective as half of the tested models at identifying dominant disease variants. When applied to GOF variants, SPDV performs similarly to top VEPs. We show that SPDV performance improves with increasing target EDC values and identify an EDC threshold after which SPDV consistently surpasses all other predictors.

On solid media, Mah forms two distinct colony morphologies, smooth transparent (SmT) and smooth opaque (SmO). These colony morphologies are representative of broader differential phenotypic states in which SmT cells are virulent and have high resistance to antibiotics while SmO cells are avirulent, antibiotic-sensitive and grow faster than SmT cells in culture. Importantly, Mah interconverts between these two morphotypes but the mechanism of SmT-SmO switching is unknown. Here we show that SmT-SmO switching is governed by a reversible transposition event that regulates expression of a periplasmic lipoprotein, Erp (extracellular repetitive protein). We found that transposition of IS1245, an endogenous insertion sequence, into the erp gene correlated with the SmT-SmO transition, and its precise removal coincided with the switch back to SmT. Genetic analyses showed that erp is required for maintenance of the SmT state and sufficient to drive the switch from SmO to SmT. We also identified a mutation in a periplasmic protease, MarP, that locks Mah in the SmO state and blocks erp-mediated switching to SmT. Our results indicate that Erp and MarP function in a signal transduction pathway that regulates a broad transcriptional response to periplasmic stress.

However, in zygotes prior to the first mitosis, this difference is resolved, using maternally inherited cytoplasmic-CENP-A. Notably, the increase in CENP-A at paternal centromeres is independent of sensing CENP-A asymmetry or the presence of maternal chromosomes. Instead, CENP-A equalization relies on asymmetric recruitment of maternal CENP-C to paternal centromeres. Depletion of maternal CENP-A decreases total CENP-A in pronuclei without disrupting equalization. In contrast, reducing maternal CENP-C or disruption of its dimerization domains impairs CENP-A equalization and chromosome segregation.

Developing Wnt surrogates with specificity for individual Fzd subtypes could be pivotal. We present a modular, potent, and Fzd7-specific Wnt surrogate that consists of three de novo designed modules, a Fzd7 binder, an LRP6 binder and a homodimeric protein. The Fzd7-specific module was designed by targeting two less conserved surface patches on the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of Fzds to achieve both selectivity and affinity. It exhibits a strong binding affinity (KD < 2.3 nM) for the very closely related Fzd7 subtype members (Fzd7, Fzd1, Fzd2) with no measurable binding to the CRDs of the other seven Fzd receptors. This Wnt surrogate induced spheroid organoid formation from intestinal stem cells at subnanomolar concentration, and promoted full hair follicle regeneration and robust hair growth in mice.
