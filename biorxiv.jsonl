Fluoroquinolones, an important class of antibiotics, are known to stimulate recombination in Escherichia coli. When bacteria are exposed to antibiotics other than fluoroquinolones, including strong up-regulators of recombination pathways, there is no detectable change in the recombination level. Here we explore why fluoroquinolones, but not other antimicrobials, increase recombination rates. Fluoroquinolones, in contrast to other antibiotics, generate DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We tested whether other drugs that also cause double-strand breaks, such as mitomycin C and bleomycin, also affect bacterial recombination rates with consistent increases in recombination. A positive correlation between the number of DSBs and the recombination frequency was found. The manipulation of the level of DSBs directly impacted the recombination frequency. Our results highlight that only antibiotics that induce DNA double-strand breaks are more probable to increase genetic diversity via recombination. The stimulation of recombination by DSB-causing antimicrobials is an additional factor leading to the risk of antibiotic resistance evolution.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

With the Python package Monod, we demonstrate how nascent and mature RNA counts, present in most published datasets, can be meaningfully \"integrated\" under biophysical models of transcription. By utilizing variation in these modalities, we can identify transcriptional modulation not discernible though changes in average gene expression, quantitatively compare mechanistic hypotheses of gene regulation, analyze transcriptional data from different technologies within a common framework, and minimize the use of opaque or distortive normalization and transformation techniques.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

In teleost fish, Muller glia possesses a remarkable regenerative capacity to replace lost RGCs and restore vision a capability lacking in mammals. Here, we have identified a six-small molecule cocktail (6C) that induces in vivo reprogramming of retina resident Muller glia into retinal neurons within the ganglion cell layer (GCL) following RGC injury. We name these cells chemically induced GCL neurons (CiGN). During reprogramming process, Muller glia re-enters the cell cycle in the inner nuclear layer, asymmetrically divide, proliferate and migrate to the GCL as SOX2+ and SOX2- intermediates, exit the cell cycle, and differentiate into CiGN cells mirroring some aspects of retinal regeneration seen in teleost fish. Functionally, 6C treatment restores long-term visual functions in rodent models of ocular hypertension and NMDA-induced RGC injury. Notably, 6C induces axon extension along the optic nerve and establish connections to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) possibly through a neuronal relay mechanism. These findings highlight small molecule mediated cellular reprogramming as a potential therapeutic strategy for vision restoration in glaucoma and other optic neuropathies that affects millions of children and adults worldwide.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

While fibrosis has been studied globally and at the region-of-interest level, its impact on stromal ductal architecture and immune cell localization remains unknown. Here, we establish cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF)-stratified ductal spatial architecture as a fundamental determinant of immune exclusion in PDAC. Focusing on malignant PDAC epithelial ductal regions, the critical interface where immune cells must access tumor epithelium, we demonstrate that periductal fibroblast organization dictates leukocyte proximity. Through integrative analysis of treatment naive patient samples from three independent cohorts--including imaging mass cytometry, multiplex immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing--we uncovered that activated, pro-inflammatory leukocytes preferentially localized near malignant ducts in regions with low fibroblast density. Stratifying epithelial-ductal regions by CAF abundance revealed a graded constraint: increasing fibroblast content corresponded to reduced leukocyte-epithelial proximity and elevated collagen I deposition. Despite their exclusion in high-CAF ducts, leukocytes in low-CAF ducts retained functional competence. Mechanistically, ligand-receptor inference implicated collagen-CD44 signaling as an adhesion axis anchoring immune cells within fibroblast-rich zones, with CD44 blockade enhancing natural killer cell invasion and motility in fibrotic spheroid models. Thus, by establishing ductal regions as critical spatial units of immune exclusion, these findings provide a framework for dissecting stromal-immune interactions and reveal targetable \"stromal checkpoints\" that can be leveraged to overcome CAF-driven barriers to leukocyte motility and infiltration in PDAC.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

To address these questions, we employed advanced phylogenomic approaches and comprehensive datasets spanning the known diversity of cellular life and viruses. Our analysis provided an updated reconstruction of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) proteome, in which we traced the phylogenetic origin of each protein family. We found compelling evidence for multiple waves of horizontal gene transfer from diverse bacterial donors, with some likely preceding the mitochondrial endosymbiosis. We inferred plausible traits of the major donors and their functional contributions to LECA. Our findings underscore the contribution of horizontal gene transfers in shaping the proteomes of pre-LECA ancestors and hint to a facilitating role of Nucleocytoviricota viruses.

Metabolic processes and products regulate aspects of B cell proliferation and differentiation into germinal center (GC) and PC states as well as Ab diversification. However, there is little information about lymphoid cell-intrinsic functions of enzymes that mediate ether lipid biosynthesis, including a major class of membrane phospholipids. Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) results had indicated that concentrations of a number of these phospholipids were substantially enhanced in GC compared to the background average in spleens. However, it was not clear if biosynthesis in B cells was a basis for this finding, or whether such cell-intrinsic biosynthesis contributes to B cell physiology or Ab responses. Ether lipid biosynthesis can involve the enzyme PexRAP, the product of the Dhrs7b gene. Using combinations of IMS and immunization experiments in mouse models with inducible Dhrs7b loss-of-function, we now show that B lineage-intrinsic expression of PexRAP promotes the magnitude and affinity maturation of a serological response. Moreover, the data revealed a Dhrs7b-dependent increase in ether phospholipids in primary follicles with a more prominent increase in GC. Mechanistically, PexRAP impacted B cell proliferation via enhanced survival associated with controlling levels of ROS and membrane peroxidation.

H.", "abstract": "UBB+1, a ubiquitin variant protein resulting from a frameshift in the ubiquitin-B gene, is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). At the cellular level, UBB+1 disrupts the ubiquitin-proteasome system while inducing autophagy. Notably, UBB+1 itself is secreted via autophagosome-like vesicles. Here, we demonstrate that UBB+1 can be removed from the cell by degradative and secretory autophagy. SQSTM1/p62 functions as a pivotal ubiquitin receptor for UBB+1, recognizing its ubiquitin domain and facilitating loading into autophagosomes. Oligomerization of SQSTM1/p62 was critical to isolate UBB+1 in bodies preventing its aggregation. Intriguingly, both gain- and loss-of-function SQSTM1/p62 suppressed UBB+1 secretion, causing intracellular retention. SQSTM1/p62 knockout led to UBB+1 accumulation in insoluble aggregates, while its overexpression promoted the formation of p62-UBB+1 bodies. We further identified distinct roles for SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in secretory autophagy of UBB+1/Specifically, the R-SNARE SEC22B and the Q-SNAREs Syntaxin-4 (STX4) and SNAP23 participated in UBB+1 exocytosis. Disruption of SEC22B impaired the fusion of UBB+1-containing autophagosomes with the plasma membrane, reducing UBB+1secretion without affecting its intracellular turnover. Inhibition of lysosomes partially stabilized UBB+1 indicating that degradation and secretion are complementary processes that determine the fate of UBB+1. This study elucidates the dual roles of autophagy in managing neurotoxic proteins, highlighting SQSTM1/p62 as a key mediator of UBB+1 trafficking and secretion. Although ubiquitin typically acts as a degradation signal, our findings reveal a rare instance of a ubiquitin-related protein driving secretory autophagy.

Here, we assess changes in the interaction milieu of common bird communities in France. We estimate associated species pairs using spatial and temporal information for 109 species monitored across 1,969 sites during 17 years. We validate the ecological significance of associated species pairs by testing the relationship between the propensity to be associated and species functional proximity or shared habitat preference. We reconstruct association networks for these intra-guild bird communities and track temporal changes in network layout in terms of size, density of links, modularity and degree distribution. We show that, beyond changes usually documented based on species numbers and abundances, the interaction milieu is also changing non-randomly. Communities become smaller with a similar relative number of associations that becomes unevenly distributed through time. These structural changes vary among bird communities according to their habitat and may impact community functioning and how communities can cope with global change.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we aim to quantify how much information about these relations can be obtained from limited ancient protein data, at the scale that is currently available or will be available in the near future. We harness sequence alignments of 12 enamel and collagen proteins that have been previously reported in fossil material that is at least 1 million years old. We utilise in silico translations of hominid DNA sequences of these proteins and highlight their differential sequence conservation, indicating some of them contain much larger amounts of information than others. We also evaluate the extent to which inferred topologies from protein data differ from inferred topologies from the more informationally-dense DNA data. We show that the former may sometimes lead to inferences of the wrong tree topology due to the informational loss that comes when working with peptide data. Additionally, we determine the number of concatenated proteins necessary to confidently reconstruct the population / species tree summarizing the relations between humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, as well as those between modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans.

To tackle this, we combine time-series transcriptomics with data-driven gene regulatory network (GRN) inference to uncover the temporal regulatory mechanisms driving CLL cell behaviour within a reconstituted in vitro TME. Using cultures of peripheral blood from CLL patients or of purified patient-derived CLL cells, we profile gene expression across five time points spanning 14 days under these experimental conditions.

Our network analysis reveals distinct gene modules associated with critical processes such as cytokine signalling, metabolic reprogramming and differentiation, hallmarks of immune-cancer cell interaction. Intriguingly, we found that while the presence of immune cells in the environment significantly alters CLL cell activation, their survival trajectories are predominantly governed by intrinsic features.

This includes modulation of self-association, such as the creation of a de novo binding interface through the P13L mutation characteristic of Omicron variants. In the present work we focus on the key function of N condensing viral RNA into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) for viral assembly. Lacking high-resolution structural information, biochemical and biophysical approaches have revealed architectural principles of RNPs, which involve cooperative interactions of several protein-protein and protein-RNA interfaces, initiated through oligomerization of conserved transient helices in the central disordered linker of N. Here we study the impact of defining N-protein mutations in variants of concern on RNP formation, using biophysical tools, a virus-like particle assay, and reverse genetics experiments. We find convergent evolution in repeated, independent introduction of amino acid substitutions strengthening existing binding interfaces, compensating for other substitutions that promote viral replication but decrease RNP stability. Furthermore, we show that the P13L mutation of Omicron variants enhances RNP assembly and increases viral fitness. Overall, our data reveal RNP complexes to be highly variable not only in sequence and conformations, but also in thermodynamic and kinetic stability, with its pleomorphism affecting basic architectural principles.

In turn, there are hundreds of examples of large effect adaptations across species, but it is unclear whether they are a common occurrence in any given species. Synthesizing the different lines of evidence is further complicated by differences in study designs. Here, we reframe this long-standing question in terms of properties of the trait under selection. We ask how the genetic basis of adaptation is expected to depend on key aspects of the genetic variation in the trait and on the extent of changes in selection pressures on it (i.e., the \"trait's ecology\"). We consider a quantitative trait subject to stabilizing selection and model the response to selection when a population at mutation-selection-drift balance experiences a sudden shift in the optimal value. Using this model, we delimit how the contributions of large effect and polygenic changes to adaptation depend on the genetics and ecology of the trait, as well as on other salient factors.

However, VIS may introduce variability and systematic bias. Accelerometry (ACC) offers a cost-effective, objective alternative to capture TMS-evoked responses. Objective: To compare the RMT as estimated using EMG, ACC, and VIS. Methods: Five participants underwent TMS while EMG, ACC, and video recordings were collected. Separately, 64 observers judged hand movement in videos to estimate RMT via VIS. RMTs were compared across the three methods using Bayesian model comparison, Bland-Altman analyses, and Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs). Results: RMTs estimated via EMG were lower than those obtained using either ACC or VIS. Compared to EMG, VIS tended to overestimate RMT (mean bias = 5.23%, 95%CI = [1.00-11.00]), while ACC and VIS estimates were more closely aligned (mean bias = 0.43%, 95%CI = [-4.00 - 5.00]).

We discovered that specific SFOH components are themselves significantly heritable: PC5, PC6, MC5, SSI have heritabilities between 0.024 (SSI, se 0.004) and 0.050 (MC5, se 0.004), and are generally loaded by questions related to religious attendance, feelings of healthcare discrimination, perceived stress, and social support. The heritability of these SFOH components indicates the entanglement of genetic and social factors. We find that SFOH measures significantly influence trait variance based on double generalized linear models, with anthropometric measures showing the most extensive dispersion effects across all three SFOH measures, even after adjusting for demographic factors. Furthermore, age and sex have extensive effects on trait dispersion, reinforcing that genetic and environmental architecture of these traits varies across demographic factors. Our findings demonstrate that SFOH can influence heritability estimates and trait variance, underscoring the necessity of careful model specification and appropriate inclusion of social and environmental factors in genetic studies.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

In rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1HL), laminar recordings under urethane revealed that cathodic iDC attenuated and anodic iDC amplified both spontaneous delta oscillations and sensory-evoked responses, without causing time-locked spiking or state disruption. Computational modeling reproduced these effects and implicated dendritic summation at the axon initial segment as the mechanism for bidirectional gain control. In awake animals, iDC modulation of S1HL altered tactile sensitivity to Von Frey stimulation, demonstrating behavioral relevance.

While several SRT analysis frameworks have been developed, the vast majority of them focus on analyzing individual samples, and do not allow for comparisons of spatial gene expression patterns across experimental conditions, such as healthy vs. diseased states. Here, we present an approach to identify so-called differential spatial patterns (DSP), i.e., genes that exhibit changes in spatial expression between groups of samples across conditions. Our framework processes diverse SRT data types and detects DSP by performing differential gene expression testing across conditions. Notably, this comparison is not currently available in any other spatial omics method. In addition to detecting DSP across conditions, our framework includes two key features. First, it can identify tissue regions where expression changes across conditions. Second, it can detect spatial gene expression pattern changes across more than two experimental conditions, with flexible models. With ad hoc simulations, we demonstrate that our approach has good true positive rates and well-calibrated false discovery rates. Applied to experimental data, our method identifies biologically relevant DSP genes while maintaining computational efficiency.

Epigenetic dysfunction, particularly through altered microRNA (miRNA) expression, contributes to disease progression. Targeting these molecular aberrations is critical to prevent recurrence, limit metastasis and improve patient outcomes. Here, we identify the miR-214-3p/miR-199a-5p cluster as a stage-associated, tumor-suppressive network that is lost in recurrent and chemoresistant OC, but can be restored using engineered small extracellular vesicles enriched with this cluster (m214-sEVs). Using a clinically relevant mouse model that mimics spontaneous OC relapse following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, we showed that m214-sEVs were internalized by OC cells and the OC niche fibroblasts via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, resulting in the elevation of miR-214-3p/miR-199a-5p and the downregulation of chemoresistance-associated genes, including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), {beta}-catenin, and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein YKT6. Moreover, secondary tumor-derived sEVs (t-sEVs) released by OC and niche cells that internalized m214-sEVs reduced pro-metastatic proteins, such as integrin {beta}1 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), in their cargo and limited their capacity to promote invasion and resistance. In vitro, YKT6 overexpression in ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) attenuated the effect of m214-sEVs on sensitizing carboplatin to block OCSC migration. These findings demonstrate that engineered m214-sEVs designed to restore clinically lost tumor-suppressive miRNAs can concurrently reverse chemoresistance and reprogram tumor-derived EV communication by targeting oncogenic networks.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

With an increasing number of new methods to analyze the multitude of heterogeneous states captured in single particle images, a systematic approach to validation in this field is needed. With this motivation, we issued a challenge to the community to analyze two cryo-EM image particle sets of the thyroglobulin molecule with continuous conformational heterogeneity. The first dataset was a experimental, and the second was generated with a simulator, allowing control over the distribution of molecular structures in the particle images. This simulated dataset also enabled direct comparison between participants' submissions and the ground truth molecular structures and distributions. Participants were asked to submit 80 volumes representing the heterogeneous ensemble and estimate their respective populations in the image sets provided. Participation of the research community in the challenge was strong, with submissions from nearly all developers of heterogeneity methods, resulting in 41 submissions across both datasets. Submissions qualitatively exceeded expectations, with the molecular motions identified by methods resembling both each other and the ground truth motion. However, quantitatively assessing these similarities was a challenge in and of itself. In the process of assessing the submissions to this challenge, we developed several validation metrics, most of which require reference to the underlying ground truth volumes. However, we have also explored the use of metrics which do not necessarily reference ground truth. This is particularly apt for experimental datasets where ground truth is inaccessible. These approaches allowed us to assess the similarity and accuracy in volume quality, molecular motions, and conformational distribution of different submissions. These metrics and the efforts of all participants will help chart a path forward for the improvements of heterogeneity methods for cryo-EM and future challenges to validate these new methods as they continue to be developed by the community.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

The PI3K/Akt and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathways promote GBM cell growth and survival, invasiveness and therapeutic resistance. We hypothesize that inhibiting Akt and {beta}-catenin, which are key central regulatory components of the PI3K/Akt and Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway, will suppress GBM growth and progression. Mouse glioma cells (CT-2A) and human patient-derived glioma stem cells (N08-30) were treated with MK-2206 or iCRT3 to evaluate effects on cell viability, apoptosis, {beta}-catenin transcriptional activity, and Wnt gene and protein expression in vitro. In vivo, luciferase-expressing CT-2A cells were intracranially implanted in C57BL/6J mice to assess the impact of MK-2206 treatment on tumor progression using bioluminescence imaging. Both MK-2206 and iCRT3 reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, with MK-2206 demonstrating greater potency in reducing viability, inducing apoptosis, and inhibiting Wnt signaling. MK-2206 significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo and reduced expression of phosphorylated Akt and GSK-3{beta} in tumor tissues, confirming disruption of the Akt and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling axis. In summary, MK-2206 outperformed iCRT3 efficacy in vitro, and suppressed GBM progression in vivo.

This psychological stress causes observational mice fear memory specific to resident mouse. This learned fear is associated with the formation of synapse interconnections among visual, auditory and medial prefrontal cortices and the strengthening of synapse interconnections among intramodal neurons. These cortical neurons receive new synapse innervations from their interconnected neurons alongside innate synapse innervations and become to encode the stress signals including battle image and battle sound inputted from these synapses.

We report distinct GFAP breakdown products (BDPs) and post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are unique to TBI. Mapped PTMs provided fragment and patient-specific citrullination signatures known for destabilizing GFAP filaments. GFAP and its fragments from patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum were sequenced by mass spectrometry (MS), identifying two TBI-specific coproducts covering coil1 (20-26kDa) and coil2 (15-19kDa) in the rod-domain. These coproducts were imbalanced in biofluids with coil1-BDP enriched over coil2-BDPs detected by label-free quantitative MS and independently confirmed by immunoblot densitometry in twenty-three TBI patients. Ten-day temporal trajectories showed ongoing proteolysis, progressing from large to small fragments, with prolonged elevation of 37/39kDa fragments, and delayed rise of small products. For the first time, profiles of GFAP fragments, but not of uncleaved GFAP, predicted six-month outcome (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, GOSE), highlighting proteolytic processing as prognostic biomarker signature. These new TBI-GFAP-BDPs were independently substantiated in a human culture trauma model, offering mechanistic insight. To this end, specific findings include: Coil1-BPDs were fluid-released, while coil2-BDPs remained cellular, shown by epitope-defined coil-specific GFAP antibodies. A new cleavage site between the two coils was identified by selective epitope loss. Coil2 cellular retention could be explained by incorporation of citrullinated coil2-BDPs into non-filamentous aggregates within pathological astrocytes. Trauma-triggered proteolysis involved calpains and caspases in distinct astrocyte injury states documented using inhibitors and live-cell reporters. These novel degradation findings have significant translational relevance for monitoring disease progression in TBI patients and for linking biofluid GFAP fragments to a trauma-inflicted astroglial proteinopathy during neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

In contrast, tyramine (TA), the conceptualised inhibitory antagonist to OA, promoted collisions and overlap of motor programmes, activity-dependent inhibition, and bouts of silence during wash periods.

In budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, telomere assembly involves the Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 (CST) complex, the Ku70-Ku80 (Ku) complex, and the Rap1-Rif1-Rif2 complex. Among these, the CST complex, centered on the binding of the G-rich single-stranded region by the Cdc13 subunit, is essential for telomere maintenance and protection. Here, we show that Cdc13 also interacts with the duplex DNA adjoining its bound single strand. This junction binding enables Cdc13 to reposition the Ku complex, potentially suppressing Ku-mediated end joining, while allowing the Cdc13 and Ku complexes to synergize in protecting telomeric DNA ends, a function that can be disrupted by mutation of a conserved residue (K504E). cdc13-K504E cells remain viable but are hypersensitive to Exo1 overexpression, particularly when combined with ku80{Delta}. Surprisingly, cdc13-K504E and other telomere protection mutants are prone to adaptive metabolic reprogramming during stationary-phase growth, leading to increased fitness. This reprogramming is inheritable and centers on elevated expression of thiamine biosynthesis, salvage, and intake pathways.

Calcium oscillation assays, that harness neurons intrinsic capability to develop functional neural networks in cell culture, are currently the closest cellular models with a relevant functional endpoint to model human neuronal circuitry in a dish. Here we further developed this useful assay towards scalable drug discovery applications. We show the importance of defined neuron-to-astrocyte ratios for optimal cellular distribution and surface adherence in HTS-compatible cell culture vessels and how the cell type ratios affect network firing patterns. Increasing the neuron density resulted in decreased network spike frequencies, but increased network spike amplitudes. We identified DAPT, a molecule previously shown to promote neuronal maturation and synapse formation, as a negative regulator of astrocyte viability. Furthermore, inclusion of GABAergic neurons in the cocultures increased the network spike frequency while reducing network spike amplitudes. The GABA A receptor antagonist bicuculline did not affect network spike frequency, but increased network spike amplitudes. In order to access local field activity in an automated and scalable calcium imaging environment, we developed a pixel-based analysis for plate reader data. This method revealed that the effect of GABAergic neurons and bicuculline was restricted to local field calcium activity that coincided with synchronized network spikes. Our observations are consistent with previous findings suggesting that the presence of GABAergic neurons decreases synchronization and network spike participation of local neuronal activity, thus potentially echoing aspects of GABA action in vivo, and dysregulation thereof in pathological conditions.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

S.; Nguyen, A.; Moran, J.; Kidd, J. M.", "abstract": "Background Due to their history of domestication and breed formation, dogs are a powerful system for studying the phenotypic impact of genetic variation. Comparison of canine genome assemblies show that retrotransposons, mobile elements which mobilize through an RNA intermediate, are a major contributor to canine genetic diversity with an eightfold and 17-fold increase of LINE-1 and SINE differences, respectively, in dogs relative to that found among humans. The frequency of dimorphic retrotransposon insertions among dogs suggests these elements have mobilized at a high rate over recent canine evolution. However, the rate at which new insertions arise has yet to be determined. Results We aligned a collection of genome assemblies derived from four breed dogs, a Dingo, and an American grey wolf to a Greenland grey wolf to identify dimorphic LINE-1 and SINEC insertions. Across our panel of seven canine assemblies, we identified a total of 7,428 dimorphic LINE-1s and 51,572 dimorphic SINECs. Each assembly differs from the Greenland wolf genome by an average of 3,497 LINE-1s and 25,558 SINECs. Analysis of allele sharing among samples recapitulates known relationships and reveals substantial within-breed variation. Calibrating estimates using a previously estimated single nucleotide mutation rate of 4.5x10-9 per base pair per generation, we estimate that new LINE-1 and SINEC and insertions have occurred at a rate of 1/184 and 1/22 births over recent canine evolution. These estimates are largely consistent across assemblies and breeds. Conclusions Our phylogenetic estimate of SINEC retrotransposition in canines is approximately twice as large as that estimated for Alu in humans, while the canine LINE-1 insertion rate is within the range of human estimates. These data suggest that although SINEC has been an outsized driver of canine genome evolution, the striking levels of canine LINE-1 and SINEC dimorphism mainly reflect high levels of long-standing genetic variation.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we uncover the molecular mechanism underlying the blue-light activation of Arabidopsis CRY1 using time-resolved native mass spectrometry combined with kinetic modelling - an approach that allows us to monitor light-driven complex formation with temporal and molecular resolution. We show that CRY1 activation follows a defined, reversible assembly pathway in which monomers rapidly form dimers that then assemble into tetramers. A quantitative two-step model captures the dynamic interplay between light-driven assembly and thermal disassembly. Strikingly, ATP accelerates tetramer formation and stabilises oligomers by tuning the underlying photochemistry of the FAD chromophore. In contrast, the Blue-light Inhibitor of Cryptochromes 1 (BIC1) acts as a potent antagonist. We found that BIC1 binds to CRY1 even in the dark, with a significant increase in binding strength under blue-light conditions. BIC1 not only blocks CRY1 oligomerisation, but also actively dismantles pre-assembled tetramers. This disassembly process is light-independent and occurs regardless of CRY1's redox state. Together, these findings reveal a finely balanced regulatory system in which ATP and BIC1 act as opposing regulators to control CRY1 activation.

Effective cognition relies on large-scale brain networks flexibly reconfiguring between states of integration and segregation. Here we combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and electrocardiography (ECG) collected during cognitive tasks under rested wakefulness, after sleep deprivation, and following a recovery nap to test the hypothesis that sleep deprivation constrains this dynamical repertoire and disrupts its physiological regulation. Using time-resolved functional connectivity and graph theory, we show that sleep deprivation increases the distribution of connections across networks, while reducing the temporal variability of between-network connectivity. Furthermore, dynamic fluctuations between integrated and segregated modes of network topology were dampened, with brain regions spending more time in intermediate configurations and showing greater instability of mode transitions. These alterations were tightly linked to behavioural impairment: participants who exhibited greater contraction toward intermediate topologies also showed poorer task accuracy and slower responses. Under well-rested conditions, thalamic activity peaked prior to transitions into integrated states and was suppressed during transitions into segregated states, consistent with a coordinating role in cortical dynamics. Sleep deprivation weakened and delayed this thalamic coupling. Finally, global and regional fMRI fluctuations were elevated after sleep loss, becoming decoupled from cardiac physiology while more strongly coupled to EEG delta power, further linking reduced arousal to constrained network flexibility. Together, these findings show that sleep deprivation narrows the brain's dynamical repertoire, due to disrupted thalamic regulation and changes to the physiological integration with cortical networks.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

We combined a preregistered electroencephalography (EEG) experiment (N = 87) with the Judge-Advisor System to identify how two common forms of social information - feedback and advice - shape judgment and decision-making. Participants made numerical estimates, received either feedback (good/bad) or advice (a specific alternative estimate) that was either close to or far from their own, and then revised their response. Across behavioral and neural indices, both information types showed proximity-dependent effects, yet diverged in their temporal dynamics. Feedback elicited a feedback-related negativity (FRN) that decreased with confidence, indicating reflexive performance monitoring. Advice produced sustained late positive complex (LPC) activity whose onset slowed with higher confidence and lower proximity, reflecting deliberate integration of external information. For both, P300 amplitudes increased with proximity, consistent with the reward value of social validation. These findings reveal two complementary neurocognitive routes by which social information guides decisions: a rapid evaluative route engaged by feedback and a slower deliberative route engaged by advice. The results identify distinct temporal signatures of how the human brain incorporates others' input to refine its own judgments.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we address this issue using GT>GC (+2T>C) 5' splice site variants, approximately 15% of which retain variable amounts of wild-type transcript, as a tractable model. Drawing on disease-associated GT>GC variants and those analyzed by full-length gene splicing assays, we show that residual wild-type transcript levels form a continuum from barely detectable to near normal. Notably, GT>GC variants retaining substantial wild-type transcript (e.g., SPINK1 c.194+2T>C, HBB c.315+2T>C, and BRCA2 c.8331+2T>C) frequently present classification challenges. Our findings also indicate that in classical Mendelian disorders caused by monoallelic or biallelic complete loss-of-function alleles, GT>GC variants are not invariably pathogenic (e.g., DOCK8 c.3234+2T>C). Minigene analyses of selected CFTR and BAP1 variants further illustrate the inherent difficulty of predicting and experimentally quantifying residual wild-type transcript levels (e.g., CFTR c.2490+2T>C and CFTR c.4242+2T>C). Because GT>GC variants that generate wild-type transcript exemplify the degeneracy and context dependence of splice-site recognition, insights from their study extend to other splice-altering variants outside the invariant +1, -1, and -2 positions. Overall, our analysis highlights that grey-zone variants with intermediate functional effects represent a biological reality that complicates the genotype- phenotype relationship and underscores the need for classification frameworks that accommodate the full spectrum of variant effects and the true complexity of human genetic disease.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Employing whole-body single-cell RNA sequencing, we chart the cellular composition and transcriptional dynamics of larval, metamorphosis, and adult stages. Our tissue level atlas reveals that ectodermal and endodermal cell types in larvae and adults occupy distinct transcriptional spaces, showing greater similarity to other cell types within the same life stage than to their counterparts in the opposite stage. In contrast, mesodermal cell types from both larvae and adults cluster closely together, indicating conserved transcriptional profiles.

Its use as a substrate by bacteria has rarely been described. Here, we show that the actinobacterial species Corynebacterium glutamicum can grow well in minimal medium with 5-OP as sole carbon and nitrogen source. We identified the pxpTABC gene cluster as being essential for growth on 5-OP. The pxpT gene encodes a secondary transporter of the APC superfamily which most likely catalyzes 5-OP uptake into the cell. The pxpABC genes encode a recently identified ATP-dependent 5-oxoprolinase that converts 5-OP into L-glutamate for further metabolism. Both PxpT and PxpABC were required for growth with 5-OP. Upstream and divergent to pxpT, the gene pxpR is located, encoding a GntR-type transcriptional regulator. Deletion of pxpR improved growth on 5-OP suggesting that PxpR acts as repressor of the pxpTABC operon. This function was further supported by reporter gene studies. Purified PxpR was shown by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to bind 5-OP with a KD of 726 {+/-} 23 nM. L-proline, L-glutamate, L-glutamine, and L-aspartate were not bound under the conditions tested, suggesting that PxpR is a specific 5-OP biosensor.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe utilization of 5-OP as a carbon and nitrogen source for bacteria has rarely been investigated in the past, although this metabolite is ubiquitous in cells due to its non-enzymatic formation from the amino acids L-glutamate and L-glutamine. In Corynebacterium glutamicum cells, but also in other bacteria such as Escherichia coli, L-glutamate is present at concentrations in the range of 100 mM, suggesting a substantial and continuous 5-OP formation.

However, most human kinases lack experimentally determined active-state structures, and existing computational methods often fail to reliably predict catalytically competent conformations. Here, we present a geometry-constrained modeling framework based on AFEXplorer (AFEX) that enables robust prediction of active, ATP- and magnesium-bound states for 436 catalytic kinase domains across the human kinome. By explicitly enforcing key biophysical criteria, AFEX overcomes the template dependence and conformational bias inherent in AlphaFold2 and AlphaFold3. Benchmarking against 156 kinase-substrate complexes shows that AFEX achieves sub-2 [A] backbone RMSD in 99% of cases and accurately recapitulates critical catalytic features with precise ATP coordination. Notably, AFEX correctly predicted active conformations for EGFR and CDK2, where AlphaFold3 failed. These improvements are consistent across diverse kinase families, including both well-characterized kinases and those underrepresented or absent from AlphaFolds training data. AFEX bridges a critical gap in kinase biology by providing a generalizable framework for studying active conformations and dynamics in kinases and other signaling proteins.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

However, technical variability in sequencing and analysis often obscures true biological patterns. Large-scale studies are particularly susceptible to batch effects, such as differences in sequencing depth and platform and annotation strategies, as well as sample-to-flow-cell assignments. However, the relative effects of these factors on functional inference in such studies have yet to be systematically evaluated.\n\nWe analyzed oral-rinse WMS data from a study cohort including 671 Nigerian youths aged 9-18, sequenced on two Illumina platforms. Microbial molecular functionality encoded in these data were annotated using the mi-faser/Fusion pipeline, to capture the broad functional repertoire, and HUMAnN 3/EC numbers pipeline to characterize curated enzymatic activities. We then quantified how technical factors and batch effects shaped the recovery of microbial functionality.\n\nResultsThree findings of our work were most salient. First, we observed that the choice of annotation strategy traded off between breadth and specificity of functional coverage. Second, we found that low-prevalence functions were disproportionately lost at shallow sequencing depths, indicating that in e.g. case-control studies with few representatives of the minor class, sequencing depth could critically impact study resolution. Finally, using our newly developed model relating sequencing depth to functional recovery, we demonstrated that increasing sequencing depth does not directly or proportionally improve functional recall. That is, at as little as 10% of this studys sequencing depth, 30% of the estimated complete microbiome functional repertoire was detectable. However, even at the full depth used in this study, we were only able to recover an estimated 60% of that complete functional repertoire.\n\nConclusionsTogether, these findings and our depth-to-function mapping framework provide practical guidelines for the design and interpretation of WMS studies. Coordinating sequencing depth planning with annotation strategy, experimental design, and rigorous batch control is thus essential for robust detection of microbial functions and for ensuring reproducible microbiome insights.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

In mammals, pre-pachytene piRNAs execute the ancestral program of transposon silencing, whereas a second, mammalian-specific class functions during meiosis4. These pachytene piRNAs are indispensable for spermatogenesis3, yet their sequence diversity, rapid evolution, and lack of obvious complementarity have long obscured their primary targets and mode of action5. Here, we show that groups of pachytene piRNAs converge on single mRNAs with near-perfect complementarity, evoking the specificity and efficacy of classical RNA interference6. These mRNA-targeting piRNAs originate from pseudogene fragments within discrete piRNA clusters, establishing an unexpected one-to-one relationship: a given cluster encodes thousands of piRNAs that collectively silence a single gene. Deleting such piRNA clusters or their embedded pseudogene fragments, eliminates the gene-targeting piRNAs, derepresses the target mRNA, and causes spermatogenic defects. Comparative genomics reveals a simple, unifying logic, whereby rapidly evolving cluster-target pairs coexist with a conserved, primate-specific regulon maintained over tens of millions of years.

This sensory input exhibits a complex phase, direction, and frequency-dependent structure arising from whisking kinematics. Little is known about how BC microcircuits process this information. In particular, it remains unclear how the BC extracts relevant spatiotemporal features by integrating input from multiple whiskers. To investigate communication within and between cortical barrels, we targeted a hybrid voltage sensor (hVOS) to Scnn1a excitatory neurons in BC layer 4 (L4) of male and female mice (mean age 7.8 weeks), and imaged population responses to electrical stimulation. Coronal and sagittal slices presented the laminar structure with barrels aligned along stereotyped whisking directions. Voltage imaging tracked activity along an L4[-&gt;]L2/3[-&gt;]L4 relay during inter-barrel communication. AMPA receptor blockade demonstrated that this relay depends on excitatory synaptic transmission and revealed intra- and inter-barrel feedforward inhibition. Single-pulse responses were isotropic in amplitude, conduction velocity, and half-width, but latency was longer for communication with dorsal and caudal barrels. Furthermore, paired-pulse depression was weakest and recovery slowest for protraction-related directions, especially between caudally adjacent barrels, suggesting preferential enhancement of repetitive inputs in this direction. These results identify direction-dependent synaptic circuitry in the shaping of inter-barrel communication.

Several previous studies have used the auxin-inducible degron system to degrade the insulin-like DAF-2/IGF-1 receptor in hermaphrodites, finding that both ubiquitous and tissue-specific degradation can extend lifespan.

Conversely, degrading DAF-2 in the male germline decreased lifespan, opposite of its effect in hermaphrodites. Using male mating and reproductive success as a meaningful ecological and neurophysiological measure of healthspan, we found that ubiquitous degradation of DAF-2 greatly prolongs reproductive health, likely by prolonging function of the male intromittent organ in the tail.

While single deletions of either enzyme had minimal impact on the overall fitness, the double {Delta}pntAB {Delta}sthA mutant exhibited growth defects, disrupted energy charge, and redox imbalance. Unexpectedly, SthA proved essential for acetate-dependent growth, a phenotype traced to a transcriptional regulator involved in glyoxylate metabolism. Transhydrogenases also mediated tolerance to formate, a key one-carbon (C1) substrate for biotechnology, by channeling reducing equivalents released during feedstock oxidation. Synergistic activity with native formate dehydrogenases enabled redox buffering, even under stressful conditions. Functional complementation with native and engineered NAD+- or NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases validated SthA as the main sink for excess NADH. Comparative genomics linked transhydrogenase gene neighborhoods to stress and membrane processes, highlighting their evolutionary significance.

We used high-resolution anatomical images to longitudinally investigate brain morphology in the zQ175DN heterozygous mouse model (HET) and wildtype littermates (WT) at 3, 6, and 10 months of age (M), which reflect different stages of phenotypic progression. We investigated volumetric alterations using semi-automatic segmentations of HD on relevant regions-of-interest (striatum, cerebellum, corpus callosum, cerebral cortex, ventricles, and total brain volume) and whole brain voxel-wise Tensor Based Morphometry (TBM) analysis. The striatum showed the earliest progressive lower absolute volume in HET mice compared to WT, starting from 3M, followed by lower absolute volume of cortex and corpus callosum concomitantly at 6 and 10M. TBM highlighted lower relative local volume in the rostral-medial striatum at all ages, and in cerebral cortex in HET mice at 6 and 10M. A bigger relative local volume in the cerebellum was observed at all ages in HET mice, and in the globus pallidus, substantia nigra, at 6 and 10M.

Despite efforts to design or discover features for odorants to better predict how they activate the olfactory system, we lack a universally accepted way to featurize odorants. In this work, we demonstrate that feature-based approaches that rely on pre-trained foundation models do not significantly outperform classical hand-designed features, but that targeted foundation model fine-turning can increase model performance beyond these limits. To show this, we introduce a new model that creates olfaction-specific representations: LoRA-based Odorant-Receptor Affinity prediction with CROSS-attention (LORAX). We compare existing chemical foundation model representations to hand-designed physicochemical descriptors using feature-based methods and identify large information overlap between these representations, highlighting the necessity of fine-tuning to generate novel and superior odorant representations.

While these viruses contain conserved regions that cannot easily mutate without affecting viral fitness, these sites are subdominant, meaning that they are not the primary target of immune responses elicited by natural infection or current vaccines. Here, we integrated recent advances in machine learning methods for protein structure prediction and design to engineer protein immunogens that focus immune responses on a conserved, subdominant HA epitope targeted by broadly cross-reactive influenza antibodies. Iterating between computation-guided optimization and in vivo analyses generated immunogens that faithfully displayed the target epitope and redirected humoral responses toward it upon vaccination. These results provide a blueprint for applying recent protein engineering approaches to immunogen design and may inform the design of broadly protective influenza vaccines.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

While checkpoint activation is well-characterised across eukaryotes, the mechanisms governing its silencing remain less defined and are more variable in different systems. In this study, we reveal that the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans employs a dual phosphatase mediated mechanism to silence the spindle checkpoint. We show that PP1 is recruited to kinetochores by Spc105, via conserved SILK and RVSF motifs, while PP2A B56 is recruited to kinetochores through direct Bub1 binding via an LxxIxE motif. Disruption of either recruitment pathway leads to prolonged checkpoint signalling and mitotic defects, underscoring the critical roles of these phosphatases in checkpoint silencing and mitotic exit. These findings further establish C. neoformans as a powerful model for studying mitotic regulation in the basidiomycete lineage and identify phosphatase recruitment interfaces as potential targets for antifungal intervention.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Using ten years of tag-recapture data and environmental covariates, we assessed traditional and Bayesian von Bertalanffy (VBGM) and Gompertz models, Random Forests, XGBoost, LightGBM, Support Vector Regression, Neural Networks, and ensemble approaches through comprehensive probabilistic comparisons. Our results reveal substantial improvements from incorporating environmental context and advanced modeling. Top methods achieved 70 to 80 percent error reductions compared to baseline models, equivalent to 45 to 70 mm improvements or 20 to 32 percent of mean fish length. A stacked ensemble of XGBoost and the VBGM achieved optimal performance (RMSE = 15.96 mm, R2 = 0.966), demonstrating complete stochastic dominance across the posterior. Gradient boosting models formed a strong second tier, with LightGBM (9 dominances) and XGBoost (8 dominances) leading this group. Bayesian Model Averaging achieved similar accuracy while explicitly quantifying uncertainty. Even traditional mechanistic models improved markedly, up to 80 percent, when enhanced with covariates and Bayesian estimation. Feature importance analysis identified (on average) initial length, time at large, and weight at release as key predictors. The stacked ensemble dominated baseline models in over 99 percent of posterior samples, confirming its robustness. These findings establish hybrid ensemble frameworks as powerful tools for ecological forecasting, uniting predictive performance with mechanistic insight critical to conservation decision-making.

Therapeutic development has largely focused on inhibitors for KRAS codon 12 mutations (G12C/D/V/S/R) which are key drivers in lung, colorectal, and pancreatic cancers. In contrast, mutant-selective inhibitors for Q61 variants remain elusive. A common mechanistic feature of G12 and Q61 mutants is the impaired hydrolysis of GTP, which traps Ras in its active, signaling-competent state. We envisioned that an alternative therapeutic strategy - reactivation of GTP hydrolysis - could address this shared oncogenic mechanism. Here we report small molecules that accelerate GTP hydrolysis in K-Ras Q61 mutants. These compounds compensate for the loss of the catalytic residue Gln61 by introducing a general base into the active site, selectively enhancing hydrolysis of K-Ras Q61X (X = H, L, K, R) mutants by up to 20-fold while sparing the wild-type protein. In mutant cancer cell lines, these compounds reduce GTP-bound Ras levels and suppress downstream signaling. We show that the chemical design principles are generalizable to other Ras isoforms.

H.; Goodwin, D. S.; Helm, R. R.", "abstract": "Organismal mirror asymmetry is common in nature, where an individual may have either a left- or right- handed form; however, the causes and consequences of this asymmetry have long fascinated and perplexed biologists. The cnidarian by-the-wind sailor jelly Velella is globally distributed, floating on the sea surface and harnessing the wind with a protruding fleshy sails that develop either a left-handed or right-handed orientation. For over 60 years, scientists have postulated that this handedness is related to wind-sorting, and enables a broad and consistent distribution of handedness types. In this hypothesis, due to prevailing winds, left handed sailors are more likely to wash ashore in the northern hemisphere, while right handed sailors are more likely to occur in central gyres. The opposite pattern is predicted in the southern hemisphere. Here, we leverage the global reach of community (citizen) science, genetics, and oceanographic modeling, to examine this enduring hypothesis. Our results are consistent with predicted patterns. Proportionally more left-handed sailors washed ashore in the Northern Hemisphere and right-handed sailors in the Southern Hemisphere. When sampling through the central part of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, we found almost exclusively right-handed sailors, whereas left-handed sailors occurred on the edge of the gyre toward the coast. These observations are concordant with calculated mean streamlines that would distribute left- and right-handed sailors in different patterns. Some authors suggest these handedness types are different species, consistent with their broad differences in distribution. However, we found that both left- and right-handed sailors in the western North Atlantic form a single population, with no detectable genomic differentiation or evolutionary structure in a mitochondrial phylogeny. We next examined the drivers of this differential distribution. At a regional scale, the mixed population off the western coast of Portugal experienced episodic strandings of left- and right-handed sailors in proportions correlating with observed wind and modeled sailing vectors, further supporting wind sorting of sail types as the primary cause of differential distributions. Modeling suggests that global dispersal is dependent on mirror asymmetry. Left-handed sailors are more likely to cross the equator from north-to-south, while right handed sailors are more likely to cross from south-to-north. Combined, our data provides evidence that mirror asymmetry is an important factor in a species global distribution.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

We show that respiration-locked potentials and gamma activity in the olfactory bulb are strongly modulated by brain state: they diminish during sleep and reappear during wakefulness and cortical activation. This gating occurs independently of respiratory dynamics and arises near the first synapse of the olfactory pathway. Finally, we find that neocortical slow-wave activity correlates with reduced olfactory entrainment, with coupling progressively vanishing as sleep deepens. These findings reveal a sleep-dependent sensory gating mechanism at early stages of a non-thalamic pathway, providing new insights into the neural substrates of sensory disconnection during sleep.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Exposure to environmental noise is a potent stressor that elevates arousal and impairs attention, whereas natural elements are associated with stress reduction and cognitive restoration. In this pilot study, we examined whether natural soundscapes could buffer the neural effects of noise exposure. Eleven healthy adults performed five cognitive tasks, Stroop, N-back, Go/No-Go, Dot-Probe, and Visual Search, under three auditory conditions: Noise (simulated urban traffic), Nature (ambient natural sounds), and Control (silence with earplugs). Continuous electroencephalography (EEG) captured oscillatory activity, and participants provided self-reports of mood, stress, and lifestyle habits. Behavioral accuracy and reaction time did not differ significantly across environments (all p > 0.10), indicating preserved overt performance. However, EEG revealed clear environment-dependent modulation. Relative to Control, the Noise condition produced a marked shift toward beta-dominant activity in midline cortex: mixed-effects models showed higher /{beta} ratios over central (t=3.8, cluster-corrected p<0.01) and centroparietal (t=4.6, p<0.01) regions, reflecting reduced posterior  power and a sustained-alertness profile. In contrast, Nature exposure preserved posterior  regulation while easing cognitive-load markers, {theta}/ ratios fell in bilateral temporal cortex (t=-3.2, p<0.05), {theta}/{beta} ratios dropped across frontocentral and temporal networks (t=-3.6 to -7.4, p<0.01), and the engagement index rose in the same territories (t=-3.6 to -7.3, p<0.001), consistent with greater intrinsic engagement and lower self-reported stress during the nature soundscape. Although behavioral performance remained stable, EEG data revealed distinct neural costs of noise exposure and a protective effect of natural soundscapes. These findings suggest that traditional task metrics may underestimate cognitive strain, and that biophilic auditory environments could help sustain neural efficiency and resilience in demanding work settings.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Analyses that maximised lesion coverage by including large and diverse samples reliably outperformed analyses using more restricted samples. Analyses using direct total lesion volume controls outperformed analyses using other (or no) volume corrections across all accuracy measures. False discovery rate corrections yielded the best performance in terms of target coverage, while permutation corrections yielded the best Dice coefficients.

AsymAD brains exhibited preserved mitochondrial bioenergetics, characterized by enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), electron transport chain (ETC) activity, fatty acid and lipid metabolism, and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) utilization. Pathways regulating mitochondrial complex biogenesis and calcium homeostasis were also upregulated. Key mitochondrial proteins such as MRPL47, CPT2, BCAT2, and IDH2, were consistently upregulated in AsymAD, whereas MACROD1 was downregulated. At the cellular level, excitatory neurons, including superficial, mid-layer, and deep-layer subtypes, exhibited the most preserved mitochondrial function, whereas vulnerable inhibitory subtypes, including PVALB and SST neurons, showed increased cellular abundance and bioenergetic activity.

During non-REM sleep, plasticity increased in DLPFC, indexed by elevated E/I balance measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy and polysomnography, in correlation with performance gains. During REM sleep, stability increased in mPFC, indexed by reduced E/I balance, in correlation with resilience to retrograde interference from new learning. E/I balance changes and their effects on learning paralleled those in EVA. Connectivity weights between EVA and DLPFC, and between EVA and mPFC, switched with sleep stage.

A prominent hypothesis is that the activity of ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons instructs representations of predicted reward, or value, in downstream neurons1. To directly test this model, we performed comprehensive striatal recordings in mice engaged in a trial-and-error probabilistic learning task where they continuously adapted their choices to obtain a reward of optogenetic stimulation of VTA DA neurons (paired with an auditory cue). We then assessed neural representations of action values (estimated from a behavioral model), revealing for the first time that VTA DA stimulation is sufficient to generate downstream neural correlates of action value. Surprisingly, these value correlates were strongest in the intermediate caudoputamen (CP) and weakest in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), despite NAc being the major projection target of VTA DA neurons2,3. This was true not only for the value of each choice, but also for state value (reward expectation) and relative value (the decision variable). However, value representations were differentially organized within the intermediate CP, with ventromedial domains (which receive inputs from orbitofrontal cortex) preferentially encoding state value and dorsolateral domains (which receive inputs from motor cortex) preferentially encoding relative value. A difference in learning rate for the value computation between NAc and CP did not explain the relatively weak value correlates in NAc. Instead, we found that VTA DA stimulation was sufficient to produce learned neural responses to the stimulation-paired auditory cue throughout the striatum, including in the NAc, and that animals work for this cue rather than for VTA DA stimulation itself. Overall, this suggests that VTA DA neurons support trial-and-error learning indirectly, by making stimuli valuable ('conditioned reinforcers'), which in turn support the generation of action value representations in the CP.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Both bispecifics retained potent B cell cytotoxicity and uniquely extended depletion to non-classical monocytes. A study in cynomolgus macaques showed that administration of bispecific at 5 and 50 mg/kg, or combination therapy with ofatumumab and the anti-CD40 mAb DFI105, achieved rapid and sustained depletion of CD19+CD20+ B cells in blood and lymphoid tissues, with superior memory B cell clearance compared to monospecific controls Both bispecifics transiently reduced non-classical monocytes and potently depleted dendritic cell subsets (DC1 and DC2).

While autophagy adaptors are well-known for their role in removing cytoplasmic protein aggregates, their involvement in DNA damage responses is less clear. In this study, we show that Blue cheese (BCHS), the Drosophila homolog of mammalian Alfy/WDFY3, functions as a critical regulator connecting autophagy, DNA repair, and intercellular communication. Using a Drosophila eye model with TER94 (VCP ortholog) deficiency, we observed that genotoxic stress specifically increases expression and nuclear buildup of ref(2)P (p62/SQSTM1 homolog). Reducing BCHS worsens nuclear ref(2)P accumulation and DNA damage, while increasing BCHS levels alleviates these effects, highlighting BCHS as a vital regulator of nuclear proteostasis and genome stability. Mechanistically, genotoxic stress triggers reversible separation of the ref(2)P-BCHS complex, temporally coordinated with ref(2)P nuclear translocation. Strikingly, BCHS undergoes dynamic redistribution from the nuclear periphery to the extracellular matrix (ECM) via an exosome-dependent pathway involving Rab11, Rab27, Rab35, VAMP7, and tetraspanin Tsp96F. Blocking BCHS secretion significantly hampers DNA repair, demonstrating that extracellular BCHS export is functionally required for genome maintenance. These findings establish a paradigm wherein autophagy adaptors serve dual roles by coordinating nuclear stress responses while communicating cellular damage status to the tissue microenvironment. Given the conservation between BCHS and human Alfy, this mechanism may have broad implications for diseases characterized by defective proteostasis and genome instability, including neurodegeneration and cancer.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Here, we use a fusion of Syb2 with the pH-sensitive GFP (Syb2-pHluorin) to track the incorporation of Syb2-containing EVs into neurons and the trafficking of exogenous Syb2 to synaptic vesicles at synapses. We determined that Syb2-containing EVs are endocytosed via Clathrin- and Dynamin-independent pathways. Moreover, Syb2-containing EVs are directly uptaken by axons and are rapidly incorporated into functional synaptic vesicles. These Syb2-pHluorin positive synaptic vesicles are endocytosed with either ultrafast (<1s) or fast (~1-3s) kinetics during synaptic transmission, suggesting limited diffusion and high fidelity in the fast retrieval of synaptic vesicle molecules immediately after fusion.

It remains elusive whether BMP signaling is implicated in zebrafish germ cell development. Here, we demonstrate that, in zebrafish, BMP-Smad1/9 signaling is required for primordial germ cell (PGC) maintenance but not for PGC fate determination or migration. BMP inhibitor treatment or whole-embryo smad1/9 knockdown reduces the number of PGCs. To investigate cell-autonomous roles of BMP-Smad1/9 in PGCs, we generated PGC-specific smad1/9 knockouts using a double-transgenic approach with PGC-specific expression of Cas9 and ubiquitous expression of guide RNAs (gRNAs). Loss of Smad1/9 in PGCs leads to impaired PGC proliferation and increased apoptosis, resulting in reduced PGC numbers and adult sex bias. Moreover, transcriptome analysis of smad1-deficient PGCs revealed no significant changes in the expression of PGC-specific genes, but a marked upregulation of genes involved in cell cycle checkpoints and DNA damage repair. Notably, ectopic ATR-pChk1 activation in smad1-cKO PGCs validates cell cycle defects and DNA replication stress. ATR inhibition restores PGC numbers in mutant embryos.

To characterize such responses, we need tools that capture how coherently species respond across a community, and to predict their consequences, we must account for ecological interactions. We first introduce the Ecological Coherence (EC) framework, which describes how species' co-responses are structured within a community. Building on this foundation, we extend it to Ecological Network Coherence (ENC), which embeds co-responses within the network of interactions by restricting them to interacting species. Both are expressed through two complementary representations: a response correlation matrix and the distribution of its values. The first can reveal aspects such as coherent or incoherent modules and the roles species play in shaping coherence, whereas the second provides a profile whose shape may serve as an early-warning indicator of instability. These can be applied to both intrinsic responses (environmental performance) and realized responses (abundance dynamics), derived from currently available monitoring data. We illustrate this approach in two empirical systems: a tropical pollination network, where interacting mutualists were more coherent in their temperature responses than the broader community, and a marine food web, where coherence in abundance trends shifted during collapse. Using a Lotka-Volterra model, we further show that ENC distributions with higher variance - reflecting stronger positive and negative co-responses - increase the risk of instability or amplification in dynamics. We also find that species influential in both the correlation matrix and the interaction matrix are key drivers of major dynamic shifts. These results point to the importance of further exploring ENC distributions as potential early-warning indicators of ecological disruption.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

In ants, CHCs are stored and homogenised in the pharyngeal gland, contributing to the formation of a shared colony odour that enables nestmate recognition. We investigated the behavioural and chemical responses of the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi to infections by the nematode Diploscapter sp., which specifically infects the pharyngeal gland. Using behavioural and chemical analyses, we show that: 1) infected ants elicit increased aggression from uninfected nestmates and non-nestmates, consistent with a social immune defence that limits parasite entry in colonies, 2) aggression is likely driven by infection-specific changes in CHC profiles, and 3) infections do not compromise nestmate recognition, which acts through distinct CHCs. Thus, while many parasitic nematodes can evade host immune recognition, Diploscapter fails to evade the social recognition system of its host.

The raw phototransistor signal was linearised to a unitless absorbance signal proportional to perfusate ICG; bi-exponential fitting yielded plasma disappearance rate (PDRbi, %/min) and the 15-minute residual fraction (R15). Across 10 whole and 3 split human livers (45 boluses; 13 paired with spectrophotometry), the sensor closely matched spectrophotometric measurements (mean R2 = 0.994; range 0.983-0.999). The sensor resolved expected physiological trends: ICG clearance increased with temperature (PDRbi: 8.2%/min (subnormothermic MP) to 22.6%/min (normothermic MP) (n=4); 9.3%/min (32{degrees}C) to 11.9%/min (36{degrees}C) (n=1)). The sensor's continuous signal traces also revealed early mixing dynamics and medication-related effects that are missed by intermittent sampling. This optical sensor enables accurate, real-time monitoring of ICG clearance during ex-vivo perfusion. The ex-vivo setting is uniquely positioned to validate ICG clearance models and enhance clinical interpretation.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

However, the biomolecular interactions driving condensate phase separation are often weak, transient, and heterogeneous.

To overcome this challenge, we combine label-free optical scattering and vibrational spectroscopy approaches spanning ultraviolet, visible, mid-infrared, and terahertz wavelengths with deep-learning-based ensemble prediction of intrinsically disordered protein conformations. Our experimental and computational results reveal that the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of the RNA Deadbox helicase 4 (DDX4) deviates from random coil behavior and undergoes chain collapse that correlates with phase separation, which leads to lower dielectric and reduced water content inside condensates. Our data support a model of DDX4 phase separation whereby chain collapse, reduced dielectric, and water release enhance the strength of multivalent protein-protein interactions within condensates, driving condensate growth and phase separation through positive feedback. Our study addresses the critical driving forces of biomolecular phase separation across a range of length scales, providing quantitative insights into protein-protein/protein-solvent interactions and the chemical properties of condensate interiors.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Traditional histopathologic response assessments demonstrate that major pathologic response (<5-10% viable residual cancer) is associated with favorable outcomes. However, most TNT cases achieve only a minor response. We investigated whether the spatial organization of residual PDAC encodes clinically meaningful biology beyond residual tumor burden. In a retrospective cohort of 203 resected PDAC patients, all with minor pathologic response, H&E whole-slide images were segmented into cancer and stroma to subsequently quantify spatial composition (e.g., patch size/density, edge density) and configuration (e.g., patch complexity/compactness, spatial intermixing) to model treatment-resistant tumor architecture. Non-response was associated with a more fragmented interface-rich ecology, higher edge density and diversity, and reduced homotypic aggregation, independent of conventional clinicopathologic features. This demonstrates a link between emergent tissue architecture of treated PDAC and therapeutic resistance. Further, two multivariable, spatial risk models were independently associated with disease-free survival (DFS): (1) cancer mean shape index and stromal shape-index variability (high-risk median DFS 7.23 vs 11.57 months; adjusted HR 1.75, p=0.007) and (2) mean stromal area with edge density (high- vs low-risk adjusted HR 1.94, p=0.006), outperforming traditional treatment response assessments. Quantifying residual cancer-stroma topology thus yields independent, prognostic signals in post-TNT PDAC and motivates prospective, spatially informed adjuvant strategies and mechanistic studies of edge habitats and mixing as therapeutic vulnerabilities.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

These tumor cells often adopt unique strategies under drug stress to attain a reversible drug-tolerant state and evade cell death. However, the molecular adaptations associated with this transitory emergence of the drug-tolerant state remain elusive. Herein, epigenetic alterations often dictate such reversible dynamic changes, and this study aims to characterize the role of specific epigenetic modifiers governing CRC cell survival under drug pressure and their subsequent relapse. We observed that under drug stress there is a drastic increase in the histone-repressive mark-H3K27me3, linked to an enhanced expression of EZH2 driving transcriptional inhibition of cell proliferation-associated genes and a proliferative arrest. Interestingly, drug-induced oxidative stress increased the expression of the P65 protein, which was found to interact and regulate EZH2 expression. Quenching of ROS, drug vacation, or P65 inactivation compromised EZH2 activity concurrent with a re-initiation of cell proliferation. Interestingly, this reversal to proliferative state was associated with an elevated activity of the histone lysine demethylase-KDM6A. The promoter elements of the proliferative genes were now occupied by KDM6A instead of EZH2. Accordingly, a genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of KDM6A in vitro not only resulted in increased cell death but also prevented emergence of the re-proliferative CRC cells. Furthermore, KDM6A inhibition in combination with chemotherapy drug, resulted in an increased tumor regression in vivo. Our study thus highlights the importance of KDM6A as a therapeutic target in preventing CRC growth and relapse which can have future therapeutic implications.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

However, when comparing Bayesian networks, it can be difficult to determine whether observed differences are substantial enough to reflect genuine differences in the underlying systems generating the data. Here, we address this by developing bootstrap-based criteria for identifying such differences and demonstrate their performance using simulated data from synthetic Bayesian networks. Both edge-level and whole-network connectivity comparisons reliably identified when underlying networks differed, even when this involved only 5% of edges, while distinguishing these differences from sampling variation. However, even with large datasets, the criteria were unable to recover specific edge differences. Thus distinguishing that networks differed was possible, but not the specific ways they differed. These criteria establish a framework for more robust and standardised Bayesian network comparisons, with broad potential for real-world applications.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Without sexual gene recombination, it is hypothesized that the deficiency of genotypic variation and accumulation of deleterious mutations reduce the fitness of parthenogenetic lineages confronted with environmental fluctuations, which is also regarded as evolutionary dead end. There should be specific life-history strategies to explain why parthenogenesis has been existing successfully. We constructed a family pedigree for rotifer spanning six generations, comprising 1200 individuals with identical genetic background in uniform condition, tracing back to the inception of parthenogenesis from single dormant egg. The individual fitness represented by lifespan and fecundity exhibits rich variation, and seems to be determined before birth by maternal stochastic investment among clutches regardless of maternal aging. Alike to \"Do not put all your eggs in one basket\", this bet-hedging strategy spreads risk of environmental unpredictability. Despite the absence of sexual recombination, the phenotypic fitness failed to achieve fixation and heritability, instead demonstrating transgenerational compensation and trade-offs phenomenon. More siblings mean less children, and vice versa. This can be regarded as intrinsic and innate non-density-dependent self-regulation strategy of population, as limited by the conservation of disposable energy for allocation among offspring. Those strategies are conducive to explain the adaptability of parthenogenesis in evolution.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

In Drosophila melanogaster, as in mammals, early life sleep differs from mature sleep, but it is unknown whether disparate sleep regulatory mechanisms underlie these changes. Here, we identify distinct populations of octopaminergic (OA) neurons that promote arousal in larval and adult flies, thus revealing a developmental switch in sleep-wake circuit architecture. Of eight OA neurons present in the sub-esophageal zone (SEZ) of the nervous system at both life stages, dedicated, non-overlapping subsets drive arousal in larvae versus adults. Morphologic and connectomic analyses show that larval OA arousal neurons project primarily to the ventral nerve cord and lack substantial sensory input, suggesting a circuit logic optimized for internally driven arousal during early development. In contrast, adult OA arousal neurons target higher brain regions involved in cognition and receive rich multimodal sensory input, supporting wakefulness in response to environmental cues. These findings highlight a developmental transition in arousal circuitry that mirrors changing ecological demands, with juvenile systems organized to prioritize growth and feeding, insulated from sensory disturbance, and mature systems supporting sensory-guided behavior. Our results support a model of sleep regulation as a developmentally dynamic process, in which shared neuromodulators like OA operate through distinct cellular substrates tailored to life stage-specific behavioral priorities.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Previous path integration studies have been limited to small spaces (<150 m2) and the influence of complex environments on cue weighting of body and vision cues is still unclear. Here, we conducted the largest-environment free-walking virtual reality navigation study to date in a 45x25 m facility (1,215 m2) using triangle completion tasks in naturalistic environments. We systematically manipulated sensory input across three conditions: natural active walking (full sensory integration), active joystick control (visual cues only), and blindfolded active walking (body cues only). Participants navigated through both sparse fallow land without trees and more complex forest environments with 400 trees. We embedded performance data in a Bayesian cue combination model to analyse the underlying combination mechanism. Our results provide evidence that most participants substantially favour body cues over visual cues in a non-Bayesian combination process, with considerable inter-individual variance in cue dominance strength and side biases. While transitioning from fallow land to forests reduced directional variance, weighting of body and visual information remained constant. These findings advance our understanding of human spatial navigation by demonstrating that body-based cues dominate path integration even in visually rich, large-scale environments, challenging assumptions about optimal Bayesian cue integration in human navigation.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms governing IL-10 production in Treg cells remain unclear. In this study, we first identified Sox4 as a gene whose expression is down-regulated in IL-10-producing Treg cells. Comprehensive gene expression profiling of Sox4-deficient Treg cells and Sox4-overexpressing Treg cells revealed specific downregulation of Il10 and Ctla4 by Sox4. Sox4-deficient Treg cells exhibited increased IL-10 production and CTLA-4 expression both in vitro and in vivo and strongly suppressed Th2 cell proliferation compared with Sox4-expressing Treg cells. In a house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma model, Treg-specific Sox4-deficient (Sox4-cKO) mice exhibited IL-10-dependent reductions in eosinophilic inflammation and Th2 cell infiltration in the airways. A comparison of Sox4-cKO and wild-type Treg cells in the same inflamed environment in mixed bone marrow chimeric mice with HDM-induced asthma revealed that Sox4-mediated suppression of c-Maf is cell-intrinsic. In addition, overexpression of Sox4 in Treg cells repressed the activation of c-Maf-regulated chromatin regions, including those around the Il10 and Ctla4 loci. Moreover, Sox4-induced suppression of IL-10 and CTLA-4 in Treg cells was rescued by forced expression of c-Maf. While Sox4 did not significantly affect Maf mRNA levels, Sox4 degraded c-Maf proteins in Treg cells through its 33 C-terminal residues. Via a domain distinct from its C-terminus, Sox4 physically interacted with c-Maf, subsequently facilitating its degradation through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These findings elucidate a mechanism by which Sox4 influences the asthmatic responses by regulating the c-Maf/IL-10 axis in lung Treg cells.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Twenty-nine isolates, predominantly novel Pseudomonas species, inhibited one or more fish pathogen strains, with two P. aphyarum strains inhibiting every fish pathogen tested. All human pathogen strains were inhibited by at least one trout farm isolate. A biofilm assay identified strains capable of excluding F. columnare from established biofilms. Numerous strains reduced biofilm colonization, with P. aphyarum and P. idahonensis strains exhibiting the greatest reduction. Genome analysis and biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) identification from a subset of isolates revealed shared and unique clusters with strong potential for antimicrobial production, correlating in part with observed inhibition patterns. Metabolomics profiling identified a suite of strain-specific siderophores that may mediate biofilm disruption.

Therefore, we grew a native plant community in a control soil without litter, as well as in soils mixed with litter from one, two, three, and six invasive species under constant or pulsed nutrient supply. Invasive species litter altered soil microbial communities, and increased soil total nitrogen concentration and native community biomass. Under pulsed nutrient supply, native community biomass and soil total phosphorus concentration decreased with increasing litter diversity of the invasive species.

Combining mechanical scarification with cold stratification further enhanced germination compared to room-temperature (RT) storage. Additionally, growth at 18 C produced higher rates than at RT and the addition of gibberellic acid (GA3) in the media promoted both germination and seedling growth, accompanied by increased water uptake.

J.; Duecker, K.; Fakche, C.; Dugue, L.; Quinn, A.; Jensen, O.", "abstract": "Rhythmic light stimulation offers solutions to innumerable cognitive and neurological disorders. However, like any neuromodulatory technique, responses to rhythmic light stimulation are highly variable, producing challenges in replicating lab-based studies and translating findings to the clinic. Across three MEG/EEG experiments, we show that this variability can, in part, be attributed to rhythmic light stimulation eliciting multiple, coexisting neural responses which have separable impacts on cognition. Specifically, we find that rhythmic light stimulation produces distinct neural responses at the fundamental (f) and second harmonic (2f) frequencies, and that these responses are differentially shaped by endogenous oscillatory dynamics that vary across participants. Importantly, these responses separably contribute to perception, with harmonic gamma-band responses supporting the representation of stimulus-specific information, and the phase of harmonic alpha-band responses causally contributing to near-threshold visual perception. We reproduce these effects across datasets, paradigms, and oscillatory bands, suggesting that the multiplex oscillatory responses elicited by rhythmic light stimulation are a robust and pervasive phenomenon. We propose that the complexity of neural responses to rhythmic stimulation can explain why there is substantial variability between studies using these techniques, and that understanding these complex responses may help advance neuromodulatory technologies for both fundamental and clinical neuroscience.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

However, several barrier structures, including circumventricular organs and the choroid plexus, can potentially be breached by pathogens. Here, we show that Cochlin, a collagen-binding protein that is cleaved during infection to release the bacteria-aggregating and cytokine-inducing LCCL domain, contributes to defence at these regions. Transcriptome analysis and in situ hybridisation indicate that cochlin is expressed in the pineal gland, area postrema, choroid plexus and discrete regions of the meninges of zebrafish, mice and humans. Cochlin expression transiently increases in the brain of zebrafish larvae infected with Mycobacterium marinum and delivery of recombinant Cochlin reduces bacterial load. Mutation of cochlin inhibits clearance of the bacteria from the brain, and this is reversed by supplying the LCCL domain. Barrier tissues thus contribute to vertebrate brain defence by secreting Cochlin, raising the possibility for therapeutic use of Cochlin in brain infection.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

A recently identified variant, p.N264K (M1), mitigates this risk of renal damage by abolishing APOL1-G2 associated cytotoxicity. However, the molecular and structural basis of this protective effect remains incompletely understood. In this study, we first show that both the cytotoxic G2 and the non-toxic M1-G2 exhibit similar intracellular localization, surface expression, and turnover kinetics. Moreover, N-glycosylation assays indicated no differences in topology, and 3D models demonstrated that both cytotoxic G2 and non-toxic APOL1 M1-G2 span the membrane four times, forming a potential ion channel. Interestingly, molecular dynamics analyses further revealed that in M1-G2, the lysine at position 264 occludes this channel, thereby preventing ion pore activity of APOL1. These findings provide, for the first time, a mechanistic explanation for the non-toxic behavior of the APOL1 M1-G2 variant.

Using a Tree of Life framework and phylogenetic comparative methods, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of morphological and genomic traits across multiple insect orders with trait-specific taxonomic sampling optimized for data availability. Critically, while traditional metrics showed no correlation between species richness and evolutionary mode, the pattern of pulsed evolution revealed a clear macroevolutionary signal. Morphological diversification tended towards gradualism, whereas genomic evolution was predominantly pulsed. Notably, this pulsed signal manifested differently: large morphological pulses were associated with species-poor clades like Odonata, while species-rich clades exhibited major pulses in genome size. These results demonstrate that interpreting pulsed evolution's contribution to diversification requires careful consideration of both trait identity and phylogenetic context.

The rate of gene flow is measured by the expected proportion of immigrants in the recipient population at the time of hybridization/introgression. Incomplete taxon sampling can impact inference of gene flow in multiple ways. First unsampled ghost lineages that are sources of introgression may mislead inference of gene flow in analysis of genomic data from modern species. Second incomplete taxon sampling causes merges of branches on the species phylogeny, which represent populations of different sizes, and complicates the definition and estimation of the introgression probability. We use mathematical analysis and computer simulation to examine the impact of incomplete taxon sampling on inference of gene flow and estimation of its rate using genomic data. We introduce a Bayesian testing approach to select models of gene flow for a species triplet (such as inflow, outflow, and ghost introgression), using the Savage-Dickey density ratio to calculate Bayes factors. We show that the approach has excellent power and specificity. We find that genomic data allow reliable estimation of the proportion of immigrants (rather than the number of immigrants), even when the assumed demographic model is incorrect due to incomplete taxon sampling. When population size differs among species, assuming the same size may lead to seriously biased estimates of the rate of gene flow. The f-branch approach is found to be effective in reducing the number of significant gene-flow events from triplet analyses, providing useful hypotheses for rigorous testing, but often to produce underestimates of the rate of gene flow. Our results highlight the need for improving summary methods to accommodate different population sizes and to infer gene flow between sister lineages.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

In this work, we aimed to expand on this concept by developing FSC(PEG4-v{beta}6), a novel tracer that retains the Trivehexin design, but features PEGylated spacers and replaces the TRAP chelator with Fusarinine C (FSC), enabling labelling with Zirconium-89 in addition to Gallium-68.

A subcutaneously xenografted H2009 tumor model was used to assess the PET imaging potential and biodistribution at early time points with the Gallium-68-labelled compound, and at later time points (up to 6 days post-injection) with the Zirconium-89-labelled version. While [Ga]Ga-FSC(PEG4-v{beta}6) exhibited moderate binding to v{beta}6, its affinity, cellular internalization, and tumor uptake in vivo were lower compared to [Ga]Ga-Trivehexin.

We coupled a genetic algorithm-based protein identification method with LASSO-regularized logistic regression to identify minimal protein subsets optimized for diagnostic performance. A 14-protein panel, recurrent across 1,000 genetic algorithm iterations, achieved a mean accuracy of 98.0%, an F1 score of 0.98, and an ROC AUC of 0.997 on a held-out test dataset. This performance exceeded models trained on high dimensionality data (>1,400 proteins) and surpassed published transcriptomic, methylomic, and cfDNA classifiers, many of which reported AUCs less than 0.91.

Despite the well established links between clock function and reproductive success, it remains unclear whether male and female mice maintained under standard ad libitum feeding conditions exhibit circadian rhythms in the propensity for sexual behavior, and to what degree such timing influences reproductive outcomes. Using standardized mating paradigms in C57BL/6J mice, we identified a circadian rhythm in sexual behavior in both sexes, with peak sexual activity most often occurring at circadian time (CT) 13 to 16 and a trough at CT4 to 7. To test the functional significance of these rhythms, we conducted 1 hour mating trials across four cohorts of C57BL/6J mice with pairs of mice having either aligned (e.g. male CT16 peak and female CT16 peak) or misaligned (e.g. male CT16 peak and female CT4 nadir) sexual behavior phases and monitored mating outcomes via ultrasound. While pregnancies were almost as frequent across all four cohorts, the numbers of live offspring were significantly more frequent when both the male and female mated at their peak phases than when both mice mated at their troughs. Notably, mating specifically during the male behavioral peak increased the likelihood of successful delivery of pups, suggesting that male circadian phase is a key determinant of miscarriage vs successful birth. These findings establish a circadian rhythm in the propensity for sexual behavior under standard feeding and housing conditions and indicate that mating time, particularly relative to the male circadian peak, can influence reproductive success. This insight provides a foundation for translational studies that explore whether intercourse timed to the circadian rhythms of the couple might help to increase fertility chances.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Immature OSNs express odorant receptors (ORs), form dendritic knobs with short cilia, and project their axons into the olfactory bulb (OB) where they form functional synapses. Furthermore, immature OSNs respond selectively to odorants and exhibit graded responses in a higher concentration range than mature OSNs, suggesting that they provide a distinct odor input stream. Finally, in mice that lack mature OSNs, sensory input from immature OSNs is sufficient to mediate odor detection and discrimination behavior. What remains unknown, however, is how these immature OSNs contribute to odor-guided behavior in the healthy, intact olfactory system. Here we show, using male and female mice, that chemogenetically silencing immature OSNs impairs odor detection ability without affecting their odor discrimination ability. Furthermore, immature OSN silencing reduces the amplitude of odor-evoked dendritic calcium responses of OB neurons in vivo. Together, these findings suggest that immature OSNs provide distinct odor input that complements mature OSN input to contribute to odor-guided behaviors in the healthy, intact olfactory system.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Speculations hold that their underlying mechanisms play a role in aligning visual and acoustic signals. Yet whether and how the eardrum moves during an EMREO remains unclear. Starting from the assumption that the EMREO signal directly reflects eardrum movements, we probed human sound lateralization performance for sounds presented at different times during a saccade, hence the EMREO. Since the EMREO generation involves the two middle ear muscles, whose tension can alter sound transmission, we expected spatial sound discrimination performance to vary with the state of the ERMEO at the time of sound presentation. We contrasted perceptual sensitivity, bias, and reaction times for targets presented during either positive/negative or during small/large EMREO deflections in two tasks, one relying on free-field sounds and one presenting sounds in-ear. However, no analysis revealed any significant effect. Still, and in line with previous studies, we found that sound localization performance was dependent on the congruency of saccade and acoustic target directions. We conclude that either the eardrum does not move as directly reflected by the EMREO signal, or it does so, but the underlying changes at the tympanic membrane only have minimal perceptual impact. These results call for more refined studies to understand how the eardrum moves during a saccade and whether or how the EMREO impacts auditory or multisensory perception.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

To characterize the cutaneous cellular landscape in FM, we assessed the sensory profile and skin cell populations across different layers within the same cohort.

However, the extent to which these behaviors rely on social transmission versus the activation of pre-existing, latent behaviors remains unclear. Here, we systematically investigated the necessity of social observation for maternal behavior acquisition, using a social transmission pup retrieval paradigm in pup-naive virgin female mice. Following the same protocol as previous studies, we compared retrieval performance on conditions that either allowed or prevented the visual observation of maternal demonstrations. Contrary to previous findings reporting substantial differences between these conditions, we found that virgin females readily acquired pup retrieval behavior regardless of their visual access to experienced mothers. We observed no significant correlation between maternal and virgin performance after task exposure. Detailed behavioral analysis revealed that the primary difference between mothers and virgins lay on the latency to initiate the behavior, but once started, virgins complete the retrieval as fast as mothers.

Using a fully reconstituted in vitro ubiquitylation system with quantitative fluorescence-based readouts, we uncover how Mga2 amplifies subtle, fluctuating membrane signals into pronounced differences in ubiquitylation. Kinetic modeling demonstrates that this amplification does not require deubiquitylating enzymes. Instead, negative feedback arises from a diversion of ubiquitin flux toward inhibitory autoubiquitylation of the cognate E3 ligase Rsp5.

To enhance the therapeutic index of RNA-based therapeutic systems for immunomodulatory purposes, we report on the design of a novel Clec9A-targeted polymeric nanoparticle, aimed at selectively engaging dendritic cells responsible for antigen presentation. We began by evaluating in silico the binding potential of the previously reported 12-amino-acid WH peptide, known for its high affinity to mouse Clec9A, the human ortholog. Using computational tools, we designed and screened truncated variants of the peptide and identified promising candidates with retained or enhanced binding capacity to human Clec9A.

We evaluated the impact of conjugation site, comparing terminal versus lateral chain attachment on receptor targeting and confirmed in vitro that peptide orientation significantly influences binding efficiency. Additionally, we computationally generated and validated shorter mutant peptide variants with improved Clec9A affinity over the original sequences. Our findings demonstrate that rationally engineered short peptides, when site-specifically conjugated to pBAE polymers, can provide high-affinity, selective targeting of dendritic cells via Clec9A.

Methods: Using NACC clinical data as anchor variables, language makers in the I-CONECT study were linked to NACC CSF data. Surrogate CSF biomarkers were created for I-CONECT subjects using machine learning models from common NACC clinical variables. Correlations assessed associations between CSF and language markers. Results: Lower predicted amyloid-{beta} correlated significantly with reduced syntactic complexity and shorter speech responses. Higher predicted total tau and phosphorylated tau correlated with reduced syntactic complexity.

With aging, these glial cells undergo molecular and functional changes that weaken support functions and promote neuroinflammation, contributing to neurodegeneration. Yet the systems-level mechanisms of astrocytic aging remain poorly defined in human models. Because aging also heightens risk for cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, type 2 diabetes, and systemic inflammation, clarifying shared astrocytic pathways is critical for understanding brain-body crosstalk. Using an in vitro human astrocyte model exposed to sublethal oxidative stress (10 M H2O2), we profiled transcriptomic changes and identified differentially expressed genes across antioxidant defences, proteostasis, transcriptional regulation, vesicular trafficking, and inflammatory signalling. We then performed seven network-prioritization analyses on a curated human protein-protein interactome: one seeded with the astrocyte H2O&2-responsive genes and six with phenotype-associated gene sets (Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, cognitive impairment, type 2 diabetes, oxidative stress, and inflammation). Intersecting the top 5% scoring genes from each run yielded a 127-gene core shared across all seven, enriched for proteostasis, DNA repair, mitochondrial regulation, and telomere and nuclear envelope maintenance. Structure-guided analyses highlighted vulnerable interfaces, including lamin A/C-lamin B1, -actinin-filamins, 14-3-3 dimers, and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase assemblies, where pathogenic variants are predicted to destabilize or aberrantly stabilize protein interactions. Structure-based interface predictions also highlight potential interactions between APP-VCP/p97 and p53-14-3-3{zeta} that link proteostasis and stress signalling.

In this study, we report a function of H2S as a modulator of hypoxic responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. A combination of biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrates that H2S inhibits the activity of Plant Cysteine Oxidases, the molecular sensors of oxygen, through protein persulfidation to modulate hypoxia-associated responses. Furthermore, we show that H2S physiology contributes to responses to low oxygen, as disturbing H2S production impaired activation of hypoxia-responsive genes and submergence tolerance.

Our analyses reveal coordinated changes in chromatin accessibility and histone modifications accompanying transcriptome reprogramming, with changes in H3K27ac closely associated with chromatin accessibility dynamics, and H3K27me3 dynamics potentially contributing to the transition from fruit growth to ripening. Moreover, construction of the transcriptional regulatory network underlying pepper fruit development and ripening suggests that several ripening regulators identified in the climacteric tomato may also play critical roles in governing ripening in the non-climacteric pepper. During ripening, DNA methylation, particularly in the CG and CHG contexts, undergoes global demethylation, especially at promoter regions, which is accompanied by increased chromatin accessibility and likely enhances transcription factor binding activity. We further demonstrate transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of carotenoid and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) biosynthesis pathways.

Previously, we have shown that fat taste functions in a sexually dimorphic manner using molecular, cellular, and behavioral assays, and that a subtype of estrogen receptor (ER) proteins are highly expressed in Type II (receptor) cells. The underlying mechanisms of estrogen's action, though, remain unknown. Here, we sought to better understand estrogen's role in fat taste transduction at the molecular level by initially focusing on the transient receptor potential channels types M4 (Trpm4) and M5 (Trpm5), which we have shown to play roles in estrogen-sensitive fatty acid signaling in taste cells. That is, using Trpm5-deficient mice, both males and females in the estrus phase showed significantly reduced FA responses, whereas females in the proestrus phase did not, suggesting that there may be E2-dependent TRPM5-independent FA signaling in Type II cells. During periods of high levels of circulating estrogen, there was no significant difference in cellular responses to fatty acid (FA) stimuli between Trpm5-/- mice and their wild-type counterparts. Moreover, supplemental estradiol enhanced linoleic acid (LA)-induced TRPM5-mediated taste cell activation. Finally, while Type II cells depend on TRPM4 and TRPM5 for FA taste cell activation, proestrus (high estrogen) females showed a greater dependence on a TRPM5-independent pathway for fatty acid responsiveness. Together, these results underscore the substantial regulatory role of estrogen in the taste system, particularly for fatty acid signaling. Given that the taste system guides food preferences and intake, these findings may have important implications for understanding sex-specific differences in diet and, ultimately, metabolic health.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Subtype I (overcoupling) showed elevated MFC in high-order association cortices, linking to synaptic transmission activity and severe symptoms. Subtype II (undercoupling) demonstrated reduced MFC in primary cortices, associated with cell cycle regulation and treatment resistance. Both subtypes shared molecular signatures (cell types: astrocytes and oligodendrocytes; neurotransmitter systems: serotonergic and GABAergic receptors).

We presented binocularly conflicting stimuli adapted from the paradigm of continuous flash suppression to awake and anesthetized mice and examined neuronal responses in visual areas V1 and LM. Neurons often showed a preference for the left or right eye where a monocular grating was presented, and their responses were modulated by presenting a conflicting flashing Mondrian stimulus to the other eye. The direction of this modulation depended on whether neurons preferentially responded to contralateral or ipsilateral gratings. Responses of cells with a preference for ipsilateral gratings were suppressed during binocular conflict, while contralateral-preferring cells were less suppressed or even enhanced by binocular conflict. Binocular conflict modulation continued to occur under anesthesia, but response recovery after intermittent binocular conflict only occurred in awake mice. Responses to Mondrians were modulated by binocular conflict in a similar fashion as those to grating stimuli, which suggests that mouse binocular conflict processing exhibits a distinctive dependency on stimulus laterality over other stimulus features. Finally, a canonical binocular rivalry model could be successfully fitted to our data but lacked sufficient competitive inhibition and adaptation strength to create oscillatory activity under binocular conflict.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

The developing thalamus showed the most prevalent expression of autism susceptibility genes, followed by germinal zones throughout the brain. Within the thalamus, excitatory neurons showed the most enriched expression, which varied across thalamic nuclei harboring distinct circuits. Across the germinal zones, neural progenitors in the medial ganglionic eminences that generate parvalbumin- and somatostanin-positive interneurons showed highest expression.

Using time-resolved transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses from the neonatal period through adulthood, we show that mouse liver rapidly acquires oxidative and detoxification capacity after weaning. This transition enables the brain to establish energy-sufficient, low-toxicity metabolic environment for neuronal function. This maturation process is marked by progressive activation of the hepatic electron transport chain (ETC), with the mitochondrial RNA endoribonuclease LACTB2 acting as a key regulator. LACTB2 prevents the accumulation of mitochondrial RNAs and sustains expression of mtDNA-encoded ETC subunits, thereby preserving mitochondrial competence for oxidative metabolism. LACTB2 is postnatally induced in hepatocytes, and its loss causes defective glucose utilization, systemic metabolic toxicity, and impaired brain metabolism and myelination, leading to prepubertal lethality, particularly in males. Restoring ETC function through liver-targeted expression of yeast NADH dehydrogenase NDI1, inhibiting the integrated stress response or ammonia scavenging improved survival. Our findings identify LACTB2-dependent hepatic mitochondrial maturation as a central mechanism that aligns carbohydrate adaptation with the liver-brain metabolic coordination to support early-life development.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

South Asia is the world's largest producer of dairy, and milk and dairy products are widely consumed throughout the subcontinent. However, the origin, evolutionary history and selective pressures associated with LP in South Asia remain elusive. We assembled genome-wide data from ~8,000 present-day and ancient genomes from India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, spanning diverse timescales (~3300 BCE-1650 CE), geographic regions, and ethnolinguistic and subsistence groups. We find that the Eurasian LP-associated variant, -13.910:C>T, is widespread across South Asia, exhibiting clinal variation along north-south and east-west gradients. Ancient DNA analysis reveals that this variant first appeared in South Asia during the historical and medieval periods through Steppe pastoralist-related gene flow. Interestingly, unlike in other worldwide populations, the LP prevalence is almost entirely explained by Steppe ancestry-not selection-in most contemporary South Asians. A notable exception is the only two pastoralist groups, Toda in South India and Gujjar in Pakistan, that have unexpectedly high frequencies of -13.910*T, comparable to estimates in Northern Europeans. By performing local ancestry inference, we find significant enrichment for Steppe pastoralist ancestry around the LCT locus in these two geographically-distant pastoralist groups, indicative of strong selection.

Here, from a fast neutron-mutagenized population of the waxy corn inbred line HB522, we identified a mutant named wx-sweet. Its kernels exhibit a combination of waxy texture and sweet flavor properties at filling stage. Using bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and fine mapping, we mapped the causal locus to SHRUNKEN1 (Sh1) on chromosome 9, which was validated by an allelic test using a known Mu-insertion mutant. Further sequencing analysis revealed a sequence disruption in the second exon of the Sh1 gene in wx-sweet, leading to loss of gene function. The study revealed that the novel allele of sh1 impaired sucrose synthase activity, resulting in a significant increase in soluble sugar content in the endosperm of wx-sweet kernels. Transcriptome analysis of wx and wx-sweet endosperms at various developmental stages indicated that the malfunction of Sh1 leads to altered expression of genes predominantly enriched in carbohydrate metabolism pathways. Moreover, metabolomic profiling showed an increased accumulation of both sucrose and raffinose, suggesting a profound shift in carbohydrate pathway. This metabolic signature likely contributes to the desirable sweet-waxy phenotype.

One of the most important factors limiting such applications is yeast-specific modifications of glycoside chains attached to secretory proteins. This problem can potentially be solved by the identification and inactivation of genes responsible for these modifications. Previously we demonstrated that the exceptional resistance of O. polymorpha to vanadate depends on the ABV1 gene responsible for the mannosylphosphorylation of protein glycoside chain in the Golgi apparatus. Here we show that mutations altering protein glycosylation in the secretory pathway can be selected in the abv1-{Delta} mutant by screening for vanadate resistance. For one such mutant, we identified the responsible gene, which encodes a putative -1,2-mannosyltransferase. To ensure the absence of phosphomannosylation, both O. polymorpha genes, ABV1 and MNN4, which encode mannosylphosphate transferase homologs, were inactivated. Some vanadate resistant mutants generated in this strain showed defects in N-glycosylation of a recombinant glycoprotein. This demonstrates that the effects of N-glycosylation on vanadate resistance in O. polymorpha are not mediated by phosphomannosylation per se and that identification of certain genes responsible for N-glycosylation in this yeast can be performed via selection of vanadate resistant clones.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

The interface allows users to collapse or expand subtrees, paint color palettes interactively, and search for specific taxa. This allows comparison across taxonomic resolutions that are hidden in static overviews. phylobar works with any omics data with hierarchical organization, including cell type hierarchies, as we demonstrate in a case study of immune cell composition in COVID-19 patients. Availability and Implementation: phylobar is available as an R package on GitHub. It uses the htmlwidgets library to link interactive D3 visualizations with R.

Loss of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), via inactivating mutations in SUZ12 or EED, occurs frequently in MPNSTs and is associated with poor prognosis. However, the downstream chromatin and signaling consequences of these mutations remain incompletely understood. Here, we show that PRC2 deficiency in MPNST cells induces coordinated chromatin remodeling, characterized by loss of repressive H3K27me3 and gain of activating marks, including H3K27ac and H3K36me2. Integrative epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic profiling revealed that this chromatin reprogramming activates a fetal-like growth signature centered on insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and its post-transcriptional regulators, Insulin-like Growth Factor 2 mRNA-Binding Protein (IGF2BP1-3). Functional studies demonstrate that PRC2-deficient cells are selectively dependent on IGF2 for proliferation, and that restoration of SUZ12 suppresses IGF2 expression and reduces growth. Analysis of human MPNST tumors confirms upregulation of the IGF2-IGF2BP axis in PRC2-deficient tumors, highlighting its clinical relevance. Together, these findings link PRC2 loss to activation of fetal growth factor-driven oncogenic signaling and identify IGF2 and its regulatory network as potential vulnerabilities in this aggressive tumor subtype.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Luolishaniids are a highly derived and disparate clade of (typically) armoured lobopodians widely interpreted as having a suspension-feeding ecology based on the presence of five or six anterior pairs of setulose appendages. Luolishaniids are globally widespread and represent the only Cambrian non-biomineralized free living epibenthic bilaterians regarded as having a suspension feeding mode of life, but their proposed ecology only relies on a qualitative interpretation of their functional morphology. Here we test the hypothesis that the setulose appendages of luolishaniids were adapted for a suspension feeding function. Quantitative morphological comparisons reveal a positive and statistically significant relationship between body length and the mesh spacing of the setulose anterior limbs of luolishaniids. This pattern correlates with suspension-feeding scaling in extant aquatic organisms, and suggests that luolishaniids primarily fed on mesoplanktonic seston. We provide quantitative evidence for suspension-feeding in luolishaniids, which represents the first statistically supported example of modern-like predator-prey scaling patterns observed in Cambrian soft-bodied metazoans.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

M.; Medina-Saldivar, C.; Pardo, G. E.; Pacheco, L. F.", "abstract": "Early postnatal development is a sensitive period for inhibitory circuit maturation, marked by a shift in GABAergic signaling from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing actions. This transition depends on chloride homeostasis, which is regulated by the potassium-chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) and the sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC1). While these cotransporters are known to drive inhibitory development, little is understood about how early caregiving experience influences their trajectories in brain regions critical for attachment learning. Here, we examined the developmental profiles of KCC2 and NKCC1 in the piriform cortex of male and female rats from postnatal (P) day 5 to 22 and assessed their sensitivity to altered maternal care using the limited bedding and nesting (LBN) paradigm from P2 to P9. Both transporters progressively increased protein levels toward adult-like levels, with sex-specific regulation observed at the mRNA level. At P15, LBN reduced KCC2 and NKCC1 protein levels in a region- and sex- dependent manner. To evaluate the functional consequences of these changes at the neural level, we implemented a Hodgkin-Huxley computational model with dynamic ion concentration parameters, which were parameterized using our experimental data. Simulation revealed that cotransporter profiles induced by LBN altered the chloride equilibrium, changing the impact of GABAergic input on neuronal excitability. This integrative approach offers a mechanistic insight into how early caregiving experiences affect chloride transporter regulation, with consequences for synaptic signaling and neuronal activity, ultimately contributing to the development of inhibitory circuits.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

To define the underlying mechanisms, we performed longitudinal transcriptomic profiling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a cohort of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected rhesus macaques spanning four key stages: preinfection, acute infection, short term ART, and long term ART. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed dynamic immune remodeling across infection and treatment. Acute SIV infection induced robust antiviral and inflammatory programs, with upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), IL-27, JAK/STAT, and NFkB signaling, coupled with suppression of T cell and B cell activation pathways. Short term ART effectively reversed these transcriptional perturbations, restoring adaptive immune gene expression and reducing innate antiviral responses to near baseline levels. In contrast, chronic SIV infection on long term ART maintained viral suppression but was characterized by reactivation of innate immune pathways, including TLR2/TLR4/MYD88, NFkB, and inflammasome (NLRP3 or NLRP12, caspase1) signaling, along with sustained macrophage activation, platelet/coagulation signaling, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Protein analyses confirmed persistent CASPASE1 and NFkB activation in spleen tissue. Pathologic evaluation of a carotid artery from an SIV infected, long term ART treated macaque revealed macrophages in plaques with p21 expressing; senescent cells with intraluminal thrombus formation, recapitulating key features of HIV associated atherogenesis. Together, these findings demonstrate that while ART normalizes acute infection induced immune dysregulation, chronic SIV infection sustains a chronic, macrophage and TLR driven inflammatory state linked to vascular injury and aging process regardless of long term suppression of viremia.

How naive CD8+ T cells develop into memory T cells that bifurcate into long-lived central (TCM) versus effector (TEM) subsets after such an antigen encounter remains ill-defined at the molecular level. To address this gap, here we dissect the functional T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of 242 murine CD8+ TCR{beta} clonotypes specific for the peptide-major histocompatibility complex molecule (pMHC) comprising an immunodominant influenza A virus (IAV) oligopeptide epitope NP366-374 presented by H-2Db. Using single-cell transcriptomics with TCR sequencing, biophysical measurements of force-dependent TCR-pMHC interactions, in vivo memory development, and structural analyses, we integrate these data to define relationships between signaling polarity and memory fate. We find that TCM and TEM polarities are reflected in distinct subunit-related mechanotransduction biases: TCM-associated TCRs favor TCR{beta}-driven pMHC engagement, whereas TEM-associated TCRs preferentially favor TCR-driven pMHC engagement. Moreover, \"bipolar\" clonotypes (TBP) capable of generating both memory subsets exhibit more balanced signaling, the largest average clonal expansions, and broadest heterosubtypic crossreactivities. By contrast, variegated TCM TCR sequences foster mostly clonal singlets with the greatest IAV mutant recognition potential within the overall memory repertoire, thus revealing two complementary memory niche crossreactivity strategies. Weak, force-sensitive TCR bonds are pervasive for this entire repertoire, being most conspicuous amongst TCM clonotypes. At the atomic level, highly nuanced variation in TCR{beta} bonding to either peptide and/or MHC modulates mechanical load transmission across the holoreceptor's ectodomains, transmembrane segments, and CD3 cytoplasmic tails to differentially influence downstream tyrosine phosphorylation and memory development. Collectively, TCR diversity anticipates epitope-specific pathogen evolution, whereas divergent TCR signaling regulates memory fate with implications for adoptive T-cell immunotherapies seeking to maximize persistence and minimize functional exhaustion.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Although fermented foods are an important part of the human diet and have seen an increasing interest nowadays, some challenges still need to be solved. Specifically, yeast identification through culture-independent methodologies is still limited to the genus level. Unlike for bacterial species identifications, long-read sequencing technologies have barely been used for yeast species identification, and, to the best of the authors knowledge, it has not been validated with mock communities reflecting food fermentation processes yet. Therefore, in the current study, we present an amplicon-based metabarcoding approach targeting the full-length internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region comprising the ITS1, 5.8S rRNA gene, and ITS2 using the PacBio HiFi sequencing platform. This method was validated using mock communities composed of yeast species involved in sourdough, lambic beer, and cocoa fermentation processes. Accurate species-level identification was achieved for most of the species. However, special attention should be given to Saccharomyces-rich niches, as accurate species-level identification for this genus is still challenging. Furthermore, underestimation of the relative abundance of species with short ITS regions, such as Pichia and Brevibacillus, occurred. In addition, the method was successfully applied to describe the yeast diversity present in two sourdough and two lambic beer samples. Overall, the current method provides an unprecedented way of determining the species-level yeast composition of complex ecosystems present in fermented food products.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Building on this approach, we precisely adjusted cellular composition and signaling environments to generate ventral skin or-ganoids (vSkOs) with lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) progenitors, successfully recapitulating features of abdominal or groin skin. Modulating early BMP and FGF signaling redi-rected these vSkOs toward an extraembryonic fate, producing human amnion-like tis-sues, termed Amnioids.

Evaluating these interventions requires resource-intensive field trials, but a lack of standardized implementation practices, particularly regarding release ratios of modified males to wild female mosquitoes and trial timing, has led to variable outcomes. This study's objective is to propose a modeling tool for the \"in-silico\" simulation of trial designs before field implementation. To this aim, we developed an agent-based model of mosquito population dynamics. As a case study, we calibrated the model using 2019-2023 Aedes aegypti surveillance data from Miami-Dade County, Florida, and compared two GMM trial designs: a \"constant-release\" design (fixed releases based on a baseline entomological survey) and an \"adaptive-release\" design (releases adjusted weekly to the population of the control arm). Our results show that the constant-release design's effectiveness is highly dependent on the trial's start date relative to mosquito seasonality, creating large outcome uncertainty. For a 6-month trial with a 4:1 GMM:wild ratio and constant-release, the median effectiveness across all start dates was 71.4%, with an interquartile range (IQR) spanning from 55.3% to 90.0%. In contrast, the adaptive-release design yielded similar median effectiveness but with a narrower IQR regardless of the start date, trial duration, and release ratio. Overall, effectiveness is closely linked to the total number of mosquitoes released but also dependent on the timing, frequency of releases, release ratio, mosquito fitness, and duration of interventions. Our findings suggest that \"in-silico\" simulation is a valuable tool for improving trial protocol design, allowing stakeholders to test strategies and reduce outcome uncertainty before committing to a fieldwork experiment.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we compared maternal care patterns and the early development of offspring in three commonly used rat strains: Wistar, Sprague-Dawley (SD), and Spontaneously Hypertensive Heart Failure (SHHF). Maternal behaviors were recorded from postpartum day (PPD) 1 to 5 during both light and dark phases and analyzed using both conventional frequency-based methods and behavioral transition network analysis. Pup development was assessed from postnatal (PND) 6 to 22, including measures of somatic growth, eye-opening, reflex maturation, and ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). We found significant strain differences in both the frequency and organization of maternal behaviors. SD dams exhibited reduced high-crouch nursing and fewer behavioral transitions across postpartum days. In contrast, SHHF dams spent more time in the nest without nursing and engaged in more frequent self-grooming, particularly during the dark phase. Network analysis revealed distinct transition patterns among strains, capturing qualitative differences in maternal dynamics not evident in conventional analysis. Strain differences also emerged in pup development. SHHF pups showed delayed eye opening, reduced body weight gain, and slower performance in several reflexes compared to Wistar and SD pups. Additionally, USV analyses revealed that SD and SHHF pups emitted fewer and shorter calls in both isolation-induced and maternal-potentiated contexts, especially in the low-frequency range. These findings underscore the importance of considering strain-specific profiles of maternal behavior and infant development when modeling early neurodevelopmental trajectories. SHHF rats may be particularly useful for studying early-life vulnerabilities relevant to human conditions associated with perinatal adversity.

Here, we show that hypoxia-induced mitophagy occurs independently of ubiquitination. However, mitochondria are heavily ubiquitinated under hypoxic stress. A significant portion of these hypoxia-induced ubiquitin chains constitute a specific type: linear head-to-tail fusions (M1), which are known for their role in NF-{kappa}B activation during cytokine signaling.

L.; Jeevanandam, A.; Campos, S. K.; Van Doorslaer, K. K.", "abstract": "The cGAS/STING pathway is an important innate immune pathway that senses and responds to foreign DNA or damaged host DNA. cGAS recognizes DNA and generates the second messenger cGAMP which activates STING. STING then creates a platform for IRF3 to be phosphorylated before pIRF3 induces a type I interferon response resulting in transcription of anti-viral genes. We examined how HPV18 infection modulates cGAS/STING activation following DNA stimulation in primary human foreskin keratinocytes from three different donors. Following exogenous activation, HPV(+) cells produced higher levels of cGAMP compared to patient-matched HPV(-) cells yet phosphorylation of STING and IRF3 was reduced in the HPV(+) cells. The reduced STING and IRF3 activation corresponded with a selective dampening of type I interferon driven antiviral genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines in HPV(+) cells. Simultaneously, HPV(+) cells had a baseline increase in genes associated with epithelial proliferation and skin development, which remained elevated following cGAMP treatment. We demonstrate that both E6 and E7 are required and sufficient to drive increased cGAMP levels and attenuate STING activation. Our results characterize cGAS/STING pathway activation across time in HPV positive and negative cells and demonstrate that the HPV oncogenes cooperate to suppress early STING activation despite higher levels of cGAMP in these HPV(+) cells. These findings indicate that HPV modulates cGAS/STING signaling to blunt antiviral defenses without impacting other arms of the cGAS/STING pathway response.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Here we characterize the Sepiola affinis squid-vibrio symbiosis by combining whole genome sequencing of light organ isolates, confocal microscopy, and temperature dependent growth assays. Comparative genomic analyses (ANI, phylogenomics, and functional analyses) revealed two previously undescribed Vibrio species associated with the S.affinis light organ. One species clusters more distantly from other Vibrio while the other species is closer to established Vibrio clades, with the second species exhibiting an expanded repertoire of mobile elements and Type VI secretion components, suggesting heightened capacity for genetic exchange and interbacterial interaction. Confocal microscopy of juvenile squid established that the S. affinis light organ comprises twelve crypts connected by pores and ducts, expanding the number of symbiotic niches relative to other sepiolid squid. In addition, fluorescently labeled isolates from the two Vibrio species colonized juveniles in both mono and co colonization patterns within crypts. Finally, growth assays across 16-24{degrees}C identified species specific temperature differences, indicating temperature preference that may align with seasonal variability in the Mediterranean Sea. Together, these findings position S. affinis as a tractable model for studying how symbiont diversity, organ architecture, and interbacterial interactions contribute to the stability of a mutualistic symbiosis.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Composite transposon-like structures bounded by two MITE copies, designated MITE-COMPs, were previously shown to mobilize the intervening sequences. However, their association with antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs) has not yet been systematically studied, and only a few MITE-COMP structures with ARGs have been reported to date. This study thus aimed to identify new MITE-COMP members containing ARGs in the genomic sequences of the clinically important bacterial family Enterobacteriaceae in public databases. MITE-COMPs were first searched for in the PLSDB database, focusing on small plasmids, using a self-against-self blastn approach. Then, newly and previously identified MITEs were searched for in the NCBI core nucleotide database to identify MITE-COMPs located on other replicons. Bioinformatics analyses identified multiple previously unreported MITE-COMP structures containing ARGs, which are bounded by directly or inversely oriented MITEs, including IS101, MITESen1, and a novel 244-bp MITE termed MITE244. All these MITEs seem to have originated from transposons of the Tn3 family. MITE244 contains a putative cointegrate resolution site related to Tn21, and MITE244 copies in MITE-COMPs were predominantly found in inverse orientation. The ARGs embedded in newly identified MITE-COMPs include blaKPC-2, qnrS1, tet(A), qnrD1, and floR. Notably, the blaKPC-2 carbapenemase gene was found in MITE-COMPs bounded by MITE244 and another MITE-COMP bounded by IS101.

We did not find evidence of HPAI H5N1 in any of the birds tested, and there were no reports of HPAI H5N1 in wildlife tested through other surveillance schemes in 2024. Unlike previous years, we detected a diversity of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses in shorebirds. Through phylogenetic analysis we revealed that the H3N7 and H4N7 viruses recovered from Red-necked Stints were complex mosaic viruses, comprising segments of Eurasian, Australian shorebird, and Australian waterfowl segments. A H1N7 virus detected comprised a wholly Eurasian introduction, confirming this route for avian influenza viruses into Australian ecosystems. These results provide further evidence for the key role of long-distance migratory shorebirds in introducing novel LPAI viruses into Oceania. While our focus on northern migration routes remained appropriate for HPAI H5N1 surveillance in 2024, the continued spread of HPAI H5N1 to sub-Antarctic Islands demands consideration of a potential southern incursion route for Oceania in future.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

CISs load cognate effectors and eject them through contractile actions resembling those of phage tails. Ejected effectors play central roles in CIS functionality by acting on target cells and mediating various biological processes. Here, we report a novel group of CIS effectors related to phage tapemeasure protein, the transmembrane component of the phage infection machinery. This group is broadly distributed within the class actinobacteria, one of the bacterial classes in which CIS gene clusters are highly conserved, and is represented by Sle1, a cognate effector of the intracellularly localised Streptomyces lividans phage tail-like nanoparticle (SLP). This effector is associated with Sle2, which contains a CIS effector core domain and interacts with the SLP core component. Sle1 is packaged inside SLP and is translocated to lipid membranes along with SLPs. The functional domain of Sle1, probably through interactions with ribosome-containing subcellular fractions, upregulates the membrane-associated proteome in S. lividans and E. coli. This effect modifies the physiological properties of S. lividans, ultimately enhancing its adaptation to microbial competition. In addition, we revealed that Sle1-type effectors conserved among actinobacterial species are structurally and functionally diverse in their functional domains. One of them from Micromonospora eburnea constitutes a novel toxin-antitoxin system and introducing its functional domain into Sle1 reprogrammes the phenotypic responsiveness of S. lividans to neighbouring bacteria. Our findings illustrate that phage elements can be incorporated into CISs as reconfigurable platforms for bacterial adaptation to various environmental conditions.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

K.; Ray, S.; Garcia, B.; Govind, R.", "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is an important nosocomial pathogen that has been classified as an urgent threat by the CDC. Antibiotic use is the primary risk factor for the development of C. difficile-associated disease because it disrupts healthy protective gut flora and enables C. difficile to colonize the colon. C. difficile damages host tissue by secreting toxins and disseminates by forming spores. Nutrient availability and other environmental factors greatly influence toxin production in C. difficile. CodY is a global transcriptional regulator that coordinates metabolism and virulence in Gram-positive pathogens in response to nutrient availability, primarily through sensing branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, valine; ILV) and GTP. In C. difficile, CodY indirectly represses toxin production by inhibiting transcription of the positive regulator tcdR and influences sporulation through unknown mechanisms. Here, we characterized two naturally occurring CodY variants, CodY(Y146N) and CodY(V58A). The Y146N substitution is located near the GTP-binding pocket, while V58A is near the ILV-binding site. Ligand binding assays revealed GTP binding ability of CodY(Y146N) is severely compromised. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that ligand binding differentially influenced promoter binding; in the presence of GTP, CodY(Y146N) bound to the tcdR promoter less efficiently than CodY(WT). In C. difficile, production of either variant resulted in reduced repression of toxin production compared to CodY(WT). Subsequent in vivo experiments in a hamster infection model showed that strains producing CodY(Y146N) or CodY(V58A) were significantly more virulent than the CodY(WT) strain. These findings demonstrate that a single amino acid change in this global regulator can alter its ligand affinity and promoter-binding properties to potentially rewire the gene regulatory networks to enhance the pathogenic potential in C. difficile.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

This is the first report of bEVs from Veillonella magna, an exceptional gram-negative Bacillota, and the gram-positives Peptostreptococcus russellii and Turicibacter sanguinis. The morphology and protein subcellular localization patterns of bEVs reflected the envelope structures of their parent bacteria. Notably, V. magna may be able to produce both outer membrane and cytoplasmic membrane vesicles. The proteome compositions were dictated by phylogeny, suggesting largely non-selective packaging of proteins. Annotation of protein functions indicated roles in nutrient metabolism and transport, and in host immune system modulation. Peptidoglycan modifying enzymes and the abundant bacteriophage proteins in Enterobacter cloacae and Limosilactobacillus reuteri bEVs may be involved in vesicle biogenesis. The functions of many abundant bEV proteins are unknown.

While specific functions for some multiheme cytochromes are known, the complex repertoire present in any genome makes annotation and prediction of electron transfer circuitry challenging. Here we examine patterns of conservation and rates of evolutionary change among multiheme cytochromes that help explain these difficulties. Using the Ppc and OmcS cytochromes as examples we show that sequence based methods of determining protein homology can be inadequate for distinguishing between cytochromes known to have differing functions. Importantly, using mutation rate analysis, we find that multiheme cytochromes in Geobacter and Shewanella exhibit increased mutation rates, which may account for inaccurate homolog identification even between closely related organisms. Finally, an analysis of multiheme cytochrome diversity reveals that each Geobacter genome contains a high proportion of cytochromes that are unique to that individual species, suggesting a high rate of horizontal acquisition and gene loss. These increased mutational and genetic exchange rates will need to be properly accounted for in annotation tools before we can accurately ascribe function and catalog the complex repertoire of cytochromes essential to extracellular electron transfer.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

We found that NF-kB-mediated innate immunity has broad antiviral activity against the Ae. aegypti-borne orthoflaviviruses dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) in mosquito cells. In contrast, little impact of NF-kB-loss-of-function was observed for the alphavirus chikungunya virus (CHIKV) or phlebovirus Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), indicating specificity in the antiviral effects of NF-kB-mediated immunity. By comparing orthoflaviviruses with different transmission routes (mosquito-borne, tick-borne, no known vector), we demonstrated that NF-kB-mediated immunity exerts its antiviral effects both early and late in the viral replication cycle, and that NF-kB-mediated immunity is not the only molecular barrier influencing the ability of orthoflaviviruses to replicate in Ae. aegypti cells. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of mosquito NF-kB-mediated innate immunity in suppressing arbovirus replication, and shows that the barriers for arboviruses to adapt to new vector species are multifactorial and virus-specific.

Acidophilic sulfate-reducing bacteria (aSRB) can mitigate AMD by reducing sulfate to sulfide, a proton-consuming process that also precipitates metals as metal sulfides. Although sulfate reduction has been observed in AMD waters, most characterized aSRB are only moderately acidophilic and originate from protected microniches. Here, we examined the pH tolerance and proton stress adaptation of the complete organic acid-oxidizing aSRB Acididesulfobacillus acetoxydans. Continuous chemostat cultivations were operated across a pH gradient, achieving steady states from pH 5.0 (optimum) down to 2.9, with microcosms showing metabolic activity even at pH 2.5 which is typical AMD-acidity. Transcriptomic profiles remained remarkably stable across conditions, except for upregulation of the K+-transporting ATPase (kdpABC) at lower pH, suggesting an increased reliance on the chemiosmotic gradient to impede proton influx. Lipid analysis revealed increased core lipid saturation, mid-chain methylation and a shift in priming precursors from leucine to valine at low pH, indicating reduced membrane permeability and more energy-efficient biosynthetic pathways. These adaptations impede proton entry demonstrating adaptation of aSRB to AMD-like acidity and removes the critical pH bottleneck for AMD bioremediation and metal recovery.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

We recovered 132 bacterial isolates representing at least 42 species, including 15 putative novel taxa. These isolates included both potentially pathogenic species such as Sarcina perfringens and Streptococcus suis and potentially beneficial bacterial species like Lactobacillus amylovorus and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum.

Nonetheless, studies of TDMD function in mammals have been limited because only two TDMD-triggering RNAs have been identified in mice. Here, we computationally identify and validate five new TDMD-triggering sites in mouse models.

Moreover, sites in Plagl1 and Lrrc58 direct degradation of miR-322 and miR-503, respectively. Mice lacking the Plagl1 and Lrrc58 sites exhibit reduced growth, demonstrating that target-directed degradation of miR-503 and miR-322 promotes mammalian growth. Both miR-335-3p and Plagl1 are maternally imprinted, implying that they participate in parental conflict, but their corresponding triggers or target microRNA partner are not imprinted.

Epigenetic modifications, especially DNA methylation in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) genes, are implicated in addiction-related behavioral changes. While previous research has examined these genes, this study provides a novel perspective by analyzing methylation patterns in relation to aggression subtypes and methamphetamine use behaviors within a Middle Eastern cohortan underrepresented population in addiction genetics.Aims: To investigate the genetic and epigenetic factors associated with methamphetamine addiction and aggression, with a specific focus on methylation profiles of the SLC6A4 and COMT genes. Methods:Sixty male patients with methamphetamine addiction and aggression, and thirty age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Peripheral blood samples were collected for RNA and DNA extraction. Methylation levels were assessed via bisulfite sequencing, and gene expression was evaluated using qRT-PCR. Behavioral data and substance use patterns were recorded through structured assessments. Results: Patients showed significantly higher methylation levels in the SLC6A4 (63.29% vs. 7.84%, p = 0.0001) and COMT(50.98% vs. 19.77%, p = 0.0001) genes compared to controls. A strong correlation was observed between dopamine and methamphetamine levels (r = 0.846, p < 0.001). Methylation levels varied by aggression subtype and drug use frequency, suggesting epigenetic involvement in addiction severity and behavioral traits.Conclusions: This study supports the role of SLC6A4 and COMT gene methylation in methamphetamine addiction and aggression. While causality cannot be inferred, the findings encourage further investigation into epigenetic biomarkers for behavioral risk profiling.

We used neutron crystallography and large quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics-Born Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (QM/MM-BOMD) simulations of human DJ-1 and its bacterial homolog YajL to validate atomic resolution X-ray crystallographic bond length analysis, directly visualizing the shared deuteron in a low-barrier hydrogen bond (LBHB) between Glu14-Asp23 in YajL that is a conventional H-bond in DJ-1. In addition, X-ray bond length analysis of protiated and perdeuterated DJ-1 and YajL shows no significant effect of deuteron substitution on these carboxylic acid-carboxylate H-bonds but does reveal an effect at the active site glutamic acid. Residues in the vicinity of Glu14-Asp23 that might favor LBHB formation in YajL were interrogated by mutagenesis of homologous residues in DJ-1. X-ray bond length analysis and QM/MM-BOMD simulations demonstrate that a distal I21T DJ-1 substitution increases proton delocalization in the Glu-Asp H-bond.

While DNA-encoded libraries (DELs) have long been established for protein ligand discovery, recent studies have demonstrated their feasibility for identifying RNA-binding small molecules. To further advance RNA-targeted ligand discovery, a diverse, solid-phase DEL enriched in privileged RNA-binding scaffolds was constructed and applied to identify ligands of r(G4C2)exp, a toxic RNA repeat expansion implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). DEL selection outcomes were analyzed through large-scale molecular docking integrated with physicochemical and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analyses. Strong correlations were observed between docking predictions and experimental enrichment trends, supporting lead identification. The lead compound was subsequently optimized based on its docked pose to an NMR structure, resulting in analogs with enhanced binding affinity and bioactivity. These findings demonstrate that RNA ligand identification can be effectively achieved by combining DNA-encoded library technology with computational approaches for rational design and analysis, and highlight a broadly adaptable platform for RNA-targeted small molecule discovery.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

While DON is recognized as a major Fusarium virulence factor on plants, the function of CUL is still unclear. Herein, we show that CUL-deficient F. graminearum mutants created by CLM1 deletion are less aggressive on wheat than the wild-type, accompanied by increased DON-3-glucoside/DON ratios in infected wheat ears. In root elongation assays with wheat and Brachypodium distachyon, CUL had no effect alone but significantly increased the toxicity of DON. Analysis of DON/CUL-treated roots further indicated that both wheat and B. distachyon are able to glucosylate CUL and that its presence impedes DON-glucosylation in both species. We identified two B. distachyon UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGT) able to glucosylate CUL and further investigated the effect of CUL on the kinetics of validated DON-glucosylating plant UGTs (BdUGT5g03300, HvUGT13248, OsUGT79). This suggested that CUL inhibits DON-glucosylation either by serving as competitive substrate with DON or by unproductive binding. Especially BdUGT5g03300 was strongly inhibited by CUL and even its glucosides. Our results indicate that CUL contributes to Fusarium virulence by weakening plant-defenses related to UGT-catalyzed DON-detoxification. As even CUL-glucosides are potentially inhibitory to UGTs, this implies a complex synergy of CUL with DON.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

We present Hyperbind2, a multi-shot learning platform that progressively improves through iterative lab-to-AI feedback cycles, distinguishing it from static zero-shot approaches. Our platform screens antibody candidates using only primary sequence input, inferring structural context internally so no experimental crystal or NMR structure is required at inference. Our approach embeds antibody and antigen sequences into a shared representation space where binding affinity is modeled as a geometric relationship. Hyperbind2 achieves remarkable efficiency, screening up to 100 million candidates within 48 hours, and demonstrates adaptability through direct learning head model training on minimal experimental data (10-20 binders/non-binders) converging to high-affinity antibodies within three digital-experimental cycles. Model training accuracy improved from 65% to 85% across three rounds. Experimental validation achieved 21% success rate (20/96 candidates <100 nM KD) by Round 3. In a pilot study targeting a challenging multi-pass membrane receptor, Hyperbind2 designed and identified 20 high-affinity scFv antibody candidates that were experimentally validated via SPR/BLI, achieving KD [&le;] 100 nM through three multi-shot learning cycles of lab-to-AI feedback, with 3 candidates demonstrating sub-10 nM affinities. Using synthetic datasets derived from validated binders, we demonstrate the model's ability to identify high-affinity binders across diverse therapeutic formats including VHHs, scFvs, and full-length IgGs, with preliminary validation for CARs, BiTEs, and bispecifics. HyperBind2 is offered in two complementary offerings: (1) an open-source computational toolset for academic research, distributed with a lightweight contrastive model and documented workflows; and (2) a commercial platform that supplies lab-ready antibody sequences from proprietary antibody sequence libraries, with no computational work required by lab teams (via abtique.com). Hyperbind2 establishes a synergistic digital-experimental workflow where computational design and screening complements ongoing in vitro experimentation, and a continuous lab-to-AI feedback loop improves the model's performance, significantly accelerating the candidates identification, optimizing experimental resource allocation, and reducing experimental burden.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Identifying synergistic combinations of therapeutic targets requires computational approaches that integrate topological network analysis, experimental validation, and clinical applicability. This work proposes a hybrid methodology that combines Semidefinite Programming (SDP) for identification of critical nodes in gene regulatory networks, Boolean simulation for quantification of perturbation efficacy, and systematic literature validation with focus on druggability and synergy. We constructed a core regulatory network of 13 genes representing key nodes in STAT3, PI3K/AKT, and p53 signaling pathways, which are frequently deregulated in TNBC. We applied three complementary SDP formulations (Max-Cut, Influence Maximization, and Spectral Clustering) to identify candidate targets, followed by stochastic Boolean simulation for calculation of the Therapeutic Index (TI). We integrated a practical applicability scoring system that considers druggability, clinical evidence, specificity, and TNBC validation. Our analysis identified the combination STAT3 + BCL2 as the most promising therapeutic pair, with an applicability score of 0.905 and average druggability of 0.85. This finding is strongly supported by extensive experimental evidence demonstrating that STAT3 directly regulates BCL2 transcription in breast cancer cells. We demonstrate a clear methodological evolution from previous approaches: from 5 genes (Tilli et al., 2016, druggability 0.32) to 3 genes ([9], druggability 0.40) and finally to 2 genes (our work, druggability 0.85), representing a 166% increase in druggability and 60% reduction in complexity. The proposed methodology offers a systematic and reproducible framework for prioritization of therapeutic targets with focus on clinical applicability, contributing to rational development of combination therapies in TNBC.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Based on these evaluations, we propose a hybrid strategy with an accompanying Snakemake pipeline that integrates SR-WTA with LR-Twist to leverage the strengths of both approaches. SR-WTA provides broad transcriptomic coverage and allows detection of low-RNA-content cell types, while LR-Twist enriches a targeted panel of 50 genes to achieve deeper coverage for calling variants.

While cochlear implantation can restore hearing, no therapeutic interventions currently exist for vision loss. Gene augmentation therapy represents a promising approach; however, the PCDH15 coding sequence (~5.3 kb) exceeds the packaging capacity of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. To overcome this limitation, we previously engineered shortened \"mini-PCDH15\" constructs that retain key structural and functional domains while fitting within a single AAV. Among these, the mini-PCDH15-V4 variant successfully restored hearing in Pcdh15-deficient mice. Here, we investigated the ability of a cone-targeted mini-pcdh15b-V4 transgene to rescue vision in a zebrafish model of USH1F. Untreated pcdh15b-deficient zebrafish exhibited severe structural and functional defects of the retina, including disorganized and shortened photoreceptor outer segments, disrupted calyceal processes, and markedly reduced electroretinogram (ERG) and optokinetic response (OKR) performance. Targeted expression of mini-pcdh15b-V4 recapitulated typical localization of Pcdh15b to calyceal processes and outer segment membranes, rescued photoreceptor architecture, and re-established both structural organization and functional output. Treated mutants exhibited improved visual tracking behavior and full recovery of ERG a-wave and b-wave amplitudes, indicating restoration of photoreceptor and synaptic function. Importantly, mini-pcdh15b-V4 expression produced no adverse effects in wild-type or heterozygous fish, supporting the safety of cone-specific expression. Together, these findings demonstrate that mini-pcdh15b-V4 can restore both photoreceptor structure and visual function in pcdh15b-deficient zebrafish.

N.; Wehbe, L.", "abstract": "Understanding how the human brain processes naturalistic audiovisual information remains a central challenge in cognitive neuroscience. Progress has been limited, however, by the difficulty of modeling complex audiovisual feature spaces - most prior work has therefore relied on short, controlled stimuli, or on stimuli from one modality at a time, leaving cortical mechanisms that support real-world comprehension poorly characterized. Further, while recent advances in artificial intelligence now enable the extraction of high-dimensional, time-resolved features from naturalistic stimuli, how cortical regions dynamically process auditory and visual information as time unfolds remains largely unexplored. Using large-scale fMRI data collected while participants watched movies, we developed two complementary computational approaches relying on prediction performance to map the moment-by-moment dynamics of sensory processing across cortical regions: one tracks when one modality predicts a region's activity substantially better than the other, capturing temporal transitions in modality dominance, while the other identifies periods when both modalities predict the region well, indicating balanced representation of auditory and visual information. Together, these analyses reveal two complementary patterns of audiovisual organization across cortex: a pair of \"bows\" of modality switching - one posterior bow encircling category-selective visual cortex and another anterior bow spanning dorso-lateral frontal areas, and an arrow-like axis of bimodally predicted regions extending from lateral occipital cortex into the temporal cortex. The coexistence of these systems points to a cortical architecture that flexibly reweights sensory inputs while maintaining balanced multimodal representations, supporting robust comprehension of complex natural events. More broadly, this work illustrates how naturalistic neuroimaging experiments informed by modern machine learning approaches can reveal new principles of dynamic audiovisual processing in the human brain.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Drift Diffusion Models (DDMs) have been used extensively to study speed-accuracy trade-offs, but such work has typically assumed that decisions are made independently of one another. In the wild, the consequences of one decision will often influence future choices. To address this gap, we introduce a new framework -- State-Dependent Drift Diffusion Models (S3DMs) -- which integrate state-dependent variables into the decision-making process. Using simulations of foraging scenarios, we demonstrate that S3DMs can predict markedly different behavioural outcomes compared to a standard DDM. By incorporating sequential and interdependent decisions, S3DMs offer a framework that is arguably both more realistic and more biologically relevant. Our research contributes to integrating functional and mechanistic explanations of behaviour and suggests a promising direction for future studies in behavioural ecology and neuroscience.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

The bipartite binding mode by which Atg23 engages Atg9 provides a structural model for how Atg23 promotes vesicle budding.

Yet paradoxically, high intracellular iron is cytotoxic to most other cells, raising the question of how CRC cells tolerate and exploit iron-rich environments. One pathway thought to mediate iron toxicity is ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death. However, most ferroptosis regulators were identified through synthetic chemical screens or small molecule activators, and it remains unclear whether these canonical pathways explain how iron itself triggers cell death, particularly in vivo. Here, using multi-omics profiling, CRISPR screening, and in vivo models, we uncover a heme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) Coenzyme Q (CoQ) axis that enables CRC cells to buffer iron-induced oxidative stress. Heme-dependent SDH reduces CoQ, which redistributes to mitochondrial and plasma membranes to detoxify lipid ROS as a radical trapping antioxidant. This pathway functions alongside, and in some contexts independently of, canonical ferroptosis regulators.

This is because most biobanked fresh-frozen tissue required for spatial metabolomics is embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT), which introduces high-abundance polymeric interferents. Herein, we use nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI) to demonstrate the MSI of metabolites in OCT-embedded tissue. Metabolite coverage and sensitivity for prepared tissue mimetic homogenates embedded in OCT and an MSI-compatible material, carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), showed excellent agreement.

Eight days after tumor incubation, lymphoma-bearing mice were maintained on a complete or methionine-restricted diet for 2 days. Nano-DESI MSI revealed a heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, with multiple methionine-cycle intermediates (S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine) and related metabolites, including known T-cell modulators (1-methylnicotinamide, polyamines) localizing to tumor subregions. Methionine-restricted tumors exhibited reduced methionine levels and elevated S-adenosylmethionine, relative to the control group.

One general strategy that enhances chemotactic accuracy is the use of self-generated gradients, where cells locally deplete attractants to create or sharpen guidance cues. Here we show that mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) migrate toward the complement component C5a using this strategy. Cells actively deplete C5a from their surroundings, establishing local gradients as fresh attractant diffuses inward. We visualized this process in real time with fluorescent C5a and reproduced its dynamics using computational models. C5a depletion is mediated primarily by C5aR1-dependent endocytosis. This mechanism produces complex responses, with different C5a concentrations inducing temporally distinct waves of migration, and maximal chemotaxis occurring below 10 nM C5a. As expected, increasing C5a concentrations recruit more cells. In contrast, human macrophages inactivate C5a mainly through carboxypeptidase-mediated enzymatic degradation, yielding a higher optimal concentration (~30 nM) and distinct migratory dynamics. Both species also deplete externally imposed C5a gradients, sharpening them and enhancing guidance. These findings identify C5a degradation as a critical mechanism by which macrophages extract directional information from their environment. Self-generated gradient formation, despite different mechanisms across species, emerges as a conserved and versatile strategy for immune navigation.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

A.; Fehon, R. G.", "abstract": "The Hippo signaling pathway is conventionally known to restrict tissue growth in animals. Genetic studies have also shown that loss of Hippo pathway components leads to defects in asymmetric cell division in Drosophila neural stem cells, known as neuroblasts. The hallmark of neuroblast division is the asymmetric localization of aPKC/Bazooka (Par3)/Par6 complex, termed the Par complex, to the apical cell cortex. However, the localization of the Hippo pathway components in neuroblasts remains unknown. Here, we report that two key activators of the Hippo pathway, Kibra and Salvador, polarize to the apical cortex of mitotic neuroblasts. We show that apical polarity, via the activity of aPKC, and F-actin dynamics synergize to drive Kibra polarization. Together, these results suggest how Hippo pathway output may be influenced by apical polarity and the F-actin cytoskeleton and provide mechanistic insight into how the pathway's activity in neuroblast asymmetric division is regulated.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

Since this time, the industry in Canada has operated with existing genetic diversity within the broodstock, which is considerably limited relative to wild populations. The sector has not been able to realise its full potential in part due to idiopathic hatchery failures and farm stock collapses due to disease outbreaks associated with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Francisella halioticida. To support Yesso scallop production and breeding, here we generate a low-density, genotyping-by-sequencing amplicon panel using high-heterozygosity markers that are evenly spaced across the M. yessoensis genome. The panel can exploit the high genetic polymorphism of the M. yessoensis genome, with de novo SNP calling identifying over 2,500 high quality SNPs from 579 sequenced amplicons. We demonstrate the versatility of this new genotyping tool for breeding applications by conducting parentage assignment of outplanted scallops, evaluating the potential for marker-assisted and genomic selection for F. halioticida resistance, and investigating but finding no evidence for hybridization between M. yessoensis and the weathervane scallop Patinopecten caurinus within the M. yessoensis breeding population at Vancouver Island University. The high versatility of this low-cost genotyping panel will accelerate breeding efforts for M. yessoensis for production traits in Canada and elsewhere.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "DNA-based hydrogels have attracted significant attention in biomedical applications due to their programmability, biocompatibility, and tunable functionalities. However, their clinical translation is hindered by high synthesis costs, limited mechanical strength, poor stability, and complex synthesis protocols. In this work, we present a novel DNA-silk fibroin hybrid hydrogel that overcomes these limitations by combining the unique biofunctionality of DNA with the superior mechanical and chemical properties of silk fibroin. Salmon-derived DNA, an abundant and low-cost source, was incorporated with silk fibroin to form hybrid networks via a simple, scalable process. Silk fibroin served as a robust scaffold, enhancing mechanical strength, controlling degradability, and improving structural stability, while the entangled DNA-silk network reduced rapid DNA degradation. The resulting hybrid hydrogel demonstrated temporal mechanical reinforcement and prolonged stability, with in vitro studies demonstrating that the developed hybrid hydrogel enhanced the chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation of Infrapatellar Fat Pad Mesenchymal Stem Cells (IFP-MSCs). Additionally, hemostatic and in vivo studies demonstrated the potential of DNA-silk fibroin hydrogel as a promising biomaterial for rapid hemostasis and accelerated wound healing. Overall, the developed DNA-silk fibroin hybrid hydrogel offers strong potential for mesenchymal tissue engineering, hemostatic adjuvant and wound healing.", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Fast and accurate tree of blobs reconstruction under the network multispecies coalescent", "doi": "10.1101/2025.11.05.686850", "authors": "Dai, J.; Han, Y.; Molloy, E.", "abstract": "Gene flow between species or populations is an important force in evolution, modeled by the network multispecies coalescent. Phylogenetic network reconstruction under this model is notoriously challenging, with the leading methods scaling to just tens of species. Divide-and-conquer is a promising path forward; however, methods with statistical consistency guarantees require the tree of blobs (TOB), which displays only the tree-like parts of the network, to perform subset decomposition. TOB reconstruction is challenging in its own right, with the leading method TINNiK having time complexity O(n^5 + n^4k), where k is the number of input gene trees and n is the number of species. In prior work, we introduced a new framework for TOB reconstruction that operates by (1) seeking a refinement of the TOB and then (2) contracting edges in it. For step (1), we estimate a tree using TREE-QMC, a fast quartet-based species tree method with time complexity O(n^3k). For step (2), we contract edges based on the same hypothesis tests as TINNiK, which are applicable to subsets of four taxa. On simulated data sets, our method, referred to as TOB-QMC, was faster and more accurate than TINNiK. Here, we provide the theoretical justification for our framework. For step (1), we show that Weighted Quartet Consensus converges to a TOB refinement with high probability, as the number k of gene trees tends to infinity, motivating the use of fast quartet-based methods for species tree estimation such as TREE-QMC or ASTRAL. ASTRAL, in particular, is statistically consistent in this context. For step (2), we show that sampling just O(n) 4-taxon subsets around each edge is sufficient to ensure that false positive edges in a TOB refinement are contracted with high probability, as k tends to infinity. Thus, our framework enables statistically consistent TOB estimation and is fast, with asymptotic runtime dominated by tree reconstruction in step (1).", "date": "2025-11-06", "journal": ""}
