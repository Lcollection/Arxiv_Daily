High sensitivity and nucleotide resolution are required to resolve mammalian nascent transcriptomes. Here, we exploit the sensitivity of 4-thio-uridine (4sU) metabolic pulse-labelling to develop two nucleotide-resolution methods: Single-Nucleotide resolution 4sU sequencing (SNU-Seq) and size-fractionated 4sU-Seq (sf4sU-Seq). sf4sU-Seq involves gel isolation of abundant 4sU-labelled promoter proximal nascent transcripts, enabling nucleotide resolution mapping of transcription start sites and promoter proximal pauses (PPPs) on the same transcript. SNU-Seq exploits 3 prime end RNA-Seq, using bacterial poly(A) polymerase (bPAP) to polyadenylate the 3 prime ends of nascent transcripts and create oligo(dT)-primed libraries. The artificial poly(A) tail marks the precise position of polymerase on a transcription unit. SNU-Seq read levels are similar at pre-mRNAs and enhancers genome-wide and read spikes in pre-mRNA outputs map pauses, PPPs and polyadenylation sites. SNU-Seq enables discovery of thousands of unannotated regions of divergent transcription and helps define hundreds of the more than 10,000 regions of primed non-transcribed acetylated open chromatin that induce divergent nascent transcripts within 0.5h of IFN-gamma treatment in Hep3B cells. Thus, combining chromatin analysis with SNU-Seq reveals the transcriptional responsiveness of an epigenetically primed human genome", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Understanding how this functional architecture relates to the brain's dynamic activity repertoire is an essential next step towards interpretable generative models of brain function. We propose functional connectivity-based Attractor Neural Networks (fcANNs), a theoretically inspired model of macro-scale brain dynamics, simulating recurrent activity flow among brain regions based on first principles of self-organization. In the fcANN framework, brain dynamics are understood in relation to attractor states; neurobiologically meaningful activity configurations that minimize the free energy of the system. We provide first evidence that large-scale brain attractors - as reconstructed by fcANNs - exhibit an approximately orthogonal organization, which is a signature of the self-orthogonalization mechanism of the underlying theoretical framework of free-energy-minimizing attractor networks. Analyses of 7 distinct datasets demonstrate that fcANNs can accurately reconstruct and predict brain dynamics under a wide range of conditions, including resting and task states, and brain disorders. By establishing a formal link between connectivity and activity, fcANNs offer a simple and interpretable computational alternative to conventional descriptive analyses.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

K.; Mirarab, S.", "abstract": "The abundant discordance between evolutionary relationships across the genome has rekindled interest in methods for comparing and averaging trees on a shared leaf set. However, compared to tree topology, where much progress has been made, handling branch lengths has been more challenging. Species tree branch lengths can be measured in various units, often different from gene trees. Moreover, rates of evolution change across the genome, the species tree, and specific branches of gene trees. These factors compound the stochasticity of coalescence times and estimation noise, making branch lengths highly heterogeneous across the genome. For many downstream applications in phylogenomic analyses, branch lengths are as important as the topology, and yet, existing tools to compare and combine weighted trees are limited. In this paper, we address the question of matching one tree to another, accounting for their branch lengths. We define a series of computational problems called Topology-Constrained Metric Matching (TCMM) that seek to transform the branch lengths of a query tree based on a reference tree. We show that TCMM problems can be solved efficiently using a linear algebraic formulation coupled with dynamic programming preprocessing. While many applications can be imagined for this framework, we explore two applications in this paper: embedding leaves of gene trees in Euclidean space to find outliers potentially indicative of errors, and summarizing gene tree branch lengths onto the species tree. In these applications, our method, when paired with existing methods, increases their accuracy at limited computational expense.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Despite a large body of pharmacology and lesion studies, the precise neurophysiological mechanisms that underlie behavioral flexibility are still under active investigations. This work is aimed to determine the role of a brainstem-to-prefrontal cortex circuit in flexible rule switching. We trained mice to perform a set-shifting task, in which they learned to switch attention to distinguish complex sensory cues. Using chemogenetic inhibition, we selectively targeted genetically-defined locus coeruleus (LC) neurons or their input to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). We revealed that suppressing either the LC or its mPFC projections severely impaired switching behavior, establishing the critical role of the LC-mPFC circuit in supporting attentional switching. To uncover the neurophysiological substrates of the behavioral deficits, we paired endoscopic calcium imaging of the mPFC with chemogenetic inhibition of the LC in task-performing mice. We found that mPFC prominently responded to attentional switching and that LC inhibition not only enhanced the engagement of mPFC neurons but also broadened single-neuron tuning in the task. At the population level, LC inhibition disrupted mPFC dynamic changes and impaired the encoding capacity for switching. Our results highlight the profound impact of the ascending LC input on modulating prefrontal dynamics and provide new insights into the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms that support behavioral flexibility.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

In our case study on the Pyrenean brown bear population, two \"outliers\" individuals were detected more often over very large spatial extent compared to other individuals. The integration of such individuals made SCR modelling challenging, especially since it remains unclear how unmodelled heterogeneity in space use may bias connectivity and population size estimates. To address this gap, we used simulations reflecting the Pyrenean brown bear population, with two groups of individuals differing in their space use due to individual characteristics but also in their spatial responses to landscape structure. We compared six SCR model formulations that varied in whether individual and spatial heterogeneity in space use were (1) ignored, (2) explicitly modelled, or (3) handled by removing outliers. We then applied the same models to the empirical bear dataset. By combining simulations and sensitivity analyses, we highlight the challenges of choosing the appropriate modelling approach when multiple sources of heterogeneity in space use occur simultaneously. Our results show that the treatment of heterogeneity in space use should match the research objective: removing outliers supports accurate population size estimation, while explicitly modelling heterogeneity is essential for reliable connectivity assessment.

Although inflammasome activity has been extensively studied in myeloid cells, its role in natural killer (NK) cells remains underexplored. This study demonstrates that human primary NK cells can functionally activate inflammasomes both in vitro and in vivo, including in patients undergoing organ transplantation. Ex vivo stimulation with nigericin and the dipeptidyl peptidases (DPP) inhibitor Talabostat (Val-boroPro) induces pyroptotic cell death in a subset of NK cells. This is marked by the cleavage and activation of gasdermin D, a lytic pore-forming protein essential for pyroptosis. Accompanying gasdermin D activation, significant levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and residual amounts of interleukin-18 (IL-18) are released. The detection of activated caspase-4 further indicates that these processes are mediated through non-canonical inflammasome pathways in NK cells. Notably, CD56dim and CD56bright NK cell subsets exhibit distinct responses to pro-inflammatory stimulation. In patients with renal dysfunction, sustained inflammasome activation, particularly involving NLRP1 and NLRP3, is observed in NK cells, with a shift toward a more pro-inflammatory phenotype following kidney transplantation. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses further reveal persistently elevated expression of caspase-4 and gasdermin-D in transplant recipients experiencing rejection and microvascular inflammation. These findings highlight the underappreciated role of NK cells in inflammasome-driven inflammation, underscoring their importance in both basic research and clinical contexts.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

We tested connectivity derivation using simulated ground-truth spiking from detailed models of human cortical microcircuits in different layers and between key neuron types. While derivation accuracy was high for cortical layer 5 microcircuits, we showed that low-firing and inactive neurons in layer 2/3 microcircuits resulted in poor performance. We then showed that general activation paradigms for layer 2/3 microcircuits led to only a moderate improvement in derivation performance, due to a trade-off between reducing the proportion of inactive neurons and increasing correlated overactive neurons. We further improved the connection derivation performance using a more refined activation paradigm leading to jittered moderate spiking, which decreased inactive neurons without incurring unwanted correlations.

By combining large-scale atomistic and coarse-grained molecular simulations with analysis of cryo-electron microscopic data and statistical as well as kinetic models, we show here that the formation of the mammalian I/III2 supercomplex reduces the molecular strain of inner mitochondrial membranes by altering the local membrane thickness and leading to an accumulation of both cardiolipin and quinone around specific regions of the SC. We find that the SC assembly also affects the global motion of the individual ETC proteins with possible functional consequences.

We have created knockout mutants of a type III-B CRISPR-Cas complex in the thermoacidophilic archaeon Saccharolobus solfataricus to investigate potential secondary functions of the type III-B system. Deletion mutants exhibited an accelerate growth but were less quickly adaptable to changes in carbon sources in their growth media.

Here, we present Chemopleth 1.0 [available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15788189], a chemoarchitecture database for the rat hypothalamus (HY) and zona incerta (ZI), which features downloadable interactive maps featuring the census distributions of five immunoreactive neurochemical systems: (1) vasopressin (as detected from its gene co-product, copeptin); (2) neuronal nitric oxide synthase (EC 1.14.13.39); (3) hypocretin 1/orexin A; (4) melanin-concentrating hormone; and (5) alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone. These maps are formatted for the widely used Brain Maps 4.0 (BM4.0) open-access rat brain atlas. Importantly, this dataset retains atlas stereotaxic coordinates that facilitate the precise targeting of the cell bodies and/or axonal fibers of these neurochemical systems, thereby potentially serving to streamline delivery of viral vectors for gene-directed manipulations. The maps are presented together with novel open-access tools to visualize the data, including a new workflow to quantify cell positions and fiber densities for BM4.0. The workflow produces ''heat maps'' of neurochemical distributions from multiple subjects: 1) isopleth maps that represent consensus distributions independent of underlying atlas boundary conditions, and 2) choropleth maps that provide distribution differences based on cytoarchitectonic boundaries. The database files, generated using the Adobe(R) Illustrator(R) vector graphics environment, can also be opened using the free vector graphics editor, Inkscape. We also introduce a refined grid-based coordinate system for this dataset, register it with previously published spatial data for the HY and ZI, and introduce novel grid-based annotation of experimental observations. This database provides critical spatial targeting information for these neurochemical systems unavailable from mRNA-based maps and allows readers to place their own datasets in register with them.

However, limitations persist in fully capturing the complex conformational states that underlie NaV channel gating and modulation. This study explores the capability of AlphaFold2 to sample multiple NaV channel conformations and assess AlphaFold Multimer accuracy in modeling interactions between the NaV alpha-subunit and its protein partners, including auxiliary beta-subunits and calmodulin. We enhance conformational sampling to explore NaV channel conformations using a subsampled multiple sequence alignment approach and varying the number of recycles.

Adequately capturing such distributed brain-wide activity can be achieved through wide-field imaging techniques, which enable the simultaneous recording of brain activity from a wide field of view at a high rate. However, the wide field of view imposes limitations on the spatial resolution. As a result, each fluorescence trace captured by each camera pixel in this wide-field setup reflects the combined calcium-generated fluorescence of many neurons' activities. Additionally, calcium indicators, which convert neural activity into light emissions, distort the neural activity by their dynamics. The inherent noise in recordings, combined with the low spatial resolution and the distorted dynamics by the calcium indicators, makes it a particularly challenging mathematical problem to infer underlying neural activity from recorded fluorescence in wide-field imaging. To date, there has not been a rigorously studied analytic solution for this inference problem in the wide-field setting. In this work, we phrase the inference problem that arises from wide-field recordings as an optimization problem and provide an analytic solution to it. To ensure the robustness of our findings and establish a solid foundation for application, we rigorously verify our solution using real data.

We show that the topology of the encoding manifold for VISp and for higher visual areas is continuous, with smooth coordinates along which stimulus selectivity and response dynamics are organized with layer and cell-type specificity. Surprisingly, the manifolds revealed novel relationships between how natural scenes are encoded relative to static gratings--a relationship conserved across visual areas. Namely, neurons preferring natural scenes preferred either low or high spatial frequency gratings, but not intermediate ones. Analyzing responses by cortical layer reveals a preference for gratings concentrated in layer 6, whereas preferences for natural scenes tended to be higher in layers 2/3 and 4.

Although the primate LGN, with its distinct divisions (magnocellular, M; parvocellular, P; and koniocellular, K), has been extensively characterized, the intrinsic heterogeneity of LGN neurons has remained unexplained. With the development of high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics, researchers can rapidly isolate and profile large sets of neuronal nuclei, revealing a surprising diversity of genetic expression within the nervous systems, such as two types of K neurons (Bakken et al., 2021). Here, we analyzed the transcriptomes of individual cells belonging to macaque LGN using raw data from a public database to explore the heterogeneity of LGN neurons. Using statistical analyses, we found additional subpopulations within the LGN transcriptomic population, whose gene expressions imply functional differences. Our results suggest the existence of a more nuanced complexity in LGN processing beyond the classic view of the three cell types and highlight a need to combine transcriptomic and functional assessments.

By co-culturing drug-sensitive and drug-resistant NSCLC cell lines, we observed spontaneous cell-cell fusion events, particularly under gefitinib selection. These fused cells exhibited enhanced fitness and a higher degree of chemoresistance compared to parental lines across a panel of 12 chemotherapeutic agents. Further analysis, including fluorescence imaging and cell cycle analysis, confirmed nuclear fusion and increased DNA content in the fused cells. Bulk RNA sequencing revealed genomic heterogeneity in fused cells, including enrichment of gene sets associated with cell cycle progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, both of which are hallmarks of cancer.

Many types of TreMs are associated to large old trees and show slow ontogenical processes. The rarity of such TreMs (particularly in intensively managed forests) hinder the estimation of their occurrence rate along tree growth. Here, we used a continental meta-analysis on TreMs occurrence rate along tree growth to build informative priors for a model of trunk-base rot-hole occurrence on oaks within the Gresigne forest, France --- a context where stand management and tree DBH were confounded. We explored whether the use of informative priors could improve the identifiability, the precision of estimates and the predictive abilities of the model. Without prior information, the low variance of tree DBH within management modalities rendered the model poorly identifiable and prevented the detection of an effect of tree DBH per se across the range of explored tree DBH. By contrast, using informative priors contributed to improve the precision of estimates and lead to detecting a positive effect of tree DBH per se. Informative priors did not degrade the model fit and clearly improved predictive abilities on new stands. In particular, while the model without prior information did not predict the occurrence of trunk-base rot-holes significantly better than a purely random guess, the model with informative priors did. Irrespective of the prior used, models suggested that the high recruitment of trunk-base rot-holes in Gresigne may be a temporary management effect in stands undergoing conversion from coppice-with-standards to high forest through sprout thinning, which will lead to conservation issues for cavicolous saproxylic species when all conversions are complete. Because using informative priors was simple and beneficial in our study, it should be further explored in other local applied contexts to orientate forest management.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

The incidence and prevalence of the disease is higher in males, while its age of onset is earlier than in females. There are also sex differences in the symptomatology, both motor and non-motor. In female PD, tremor, pain, depression and dysphagia are predominant, whereas in male PD, freezing of gait, camptocormia, cognitive impairment and urinary dysfunction are more common. Likewise, there are sex differences in the pathophysiology of the disease, related to most of the pathological processes of PD, as is the case of the greater activation of microglia in males or the lower oxidative stress in females. All these findings support the idea that different molecular mechanisms may be involved in PD depending on the sex of the patient. Some explanations for these events are related to biological, genetic, hormonal or environmental factors, such as the possible anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effect of estrogens. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully described. Our results show sex differences in gene expression, cell-cell communication and pathway activation in all major brain cell types, highlighting the presence of greater neuroinflammation in men and greater neurodegeneration in the SNpc in men, with the latter appearing to be inverted between sexes when observed in the cortical zone.

Their outcomes and cellular composition remain an open question. The heterogeneous histological and molecular profiles of hepatoblastomas with carcinoma features (HBCs) may result from cells with combined HB and HCC characteristics (HBC cells) or from mixtures of cells displaying either HB or HCC signatures. We used multiomics profiling to show that HBCs are mixtures of HB, HBC, and HCC cell types. HBC cells are more chemoresistant than HB cells, and their chemoresistance, a driver of poor outcomes, is determined by their cell types, genetic alterations, and embryonic differentiation stages. We showed that the prognosis of HBCs is significantly worse than that of HBs. We also showed that HBC cells are derived from HB cells at early hepatoblast differentiation stages, that aberrant activation of WNT-signaling initiates HBC transformation, and that WNT inhibition promotes differentiation and increases sensitivity to chemotherapy. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that each HBC is the product of multiple HB-to-HBC and HBC-to-HCC transitions.

Accelerometers, which measure changes in acceleration across planes of movement, are increasingly being used in conjunction with machine learning models to classify animal behaviours across taxa and research questions. However, the widespread adoption of these methods faces challenges from imbalanced training data, unquantified uncertainties in model outputs, shifts in model performance across contexts, and noisy classifications. To address these challenges, we introduce an open-source approach for classifying animal behaviour from raw acceleration data. Our approach integrates machine learning and statistical inference techniques to evaluate and mitigate class imbalances, changes in model performance across ecological settings, and noisy classifications. Importantly, we extend predictions from single behaviour classifications to prediction sets - collections of probable behaviours with a user-specified likelihood of containing the true behaviour - in a framework analogous to the use of confidence intervals in statistical analyses. We highlight the utility of our approach using data collected from a free-ranging large carnivore, African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus), in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. We demonstrate significantly improved predictions along with associated uncertainty metrics in African wild dog behaviour classification, particularly for rare and ecologically important behaviours such as feeding, where correct classifications more than doubled following quality checks and data rebalancing introduced in our pipeline. Our approach is applicable across taxa and represents a key step towards advancing the burgeoning use of machine learning to remotely observe around-the-clock behaviours of free-ranging animals. Future work could include the integration of multiple data streams, such as accelerometer, audio, and GPS data, for model training and could be incorporated directly into our pipeline.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

We test this capability by evaluating whether standard PLM usage, frozen or fine-tuned embeddings with distance-based comparison, supports evolutionary reasoning. Existing PLMs consistently fail to recover phylogenetic structure, despite strong performance on sequence-level tasks such as masked-token and contact prediction. We present Phyla, a hybrid state-space and transformer model that jointly processes multiple sequences and is trained using a tree-based objective across 3,000 phylogenies spanning diverse protein families. Phyla outperforms the next-best PLM by 9% on tree reconstruction and 23% on taxonomic clustering while remaining alignment- and guide-tree-free. Although classical alignment pipelines achieve higher absolute accuracy, Phyla narrows the gap and achieves markedly lower end-to-end runtime. Applied to real data, Phyla reconstructs biologically accurate clades in the tree of life and resolves genome-scale relationships among Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. These findings suggest that, under standard usage, evolutionary reasoning does not reliably emerge from large-scale sequence modeling.

We show how the conditional model may be extended to estimate relative density as a function of habitat and other spatial variables. Unlike absolute density, coefficients of relative density are robust to bias from heterogeneous individual detection. The conditional model has the further advantage of seamlessly including individual covariates of detection, and it is faster to fit than the full model. The spatial absolute density surface may be derived from the conditional model fit. Population growth rate (relative density with respect to time) may also be estimated from a conditional model, given temporal data. These properties are demonstrated by examples and simulation. It is suggested that conditional-likelihood models, including those for relative density, play a central role in SECR.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Vegetatively diploid organisms experience specific evolutionary phenomena, including allodiploid hybridization, mitotic recombination, loss-of-heterozygosity and aneuploidy; however, studies of these forces have largely focused on yeasts. Here, we present a telomere-to-telomere phased diploid genome assembly of Auxenochlorella UTEX 250-A (haploid length 22 Mb) and introduce a genetic toolkit for site-specific manipulation of the nuclear genome in multiple strains, featuring several selectable markers, inducible promoters, and fluorescent reporters for protein localization. UTEX 250-A is an allodiploid hybrid of Auxenochlorella protothecoides and Auxenochlorella symbiontica, two species differentiated by extensive chromosomal rearrangements. UTEX 250-A haplotypes are a mosaic of each parental species following mitotic recombination, and two chromosomes are trisomic. Loss-of-heterozygosity events are pervasive across Auxenochlorella and can evolve rapidly in the laboratory. High-quality structural annotation yielded ~7,500 genes per haplotype. Auxenochlorella have experienced gene family loss and reduction, including core photosynthesis genes, and exhibit periodic adenine and cytosine methylation at promoters and gene bodies, respectively. Approximately 10% of genes, especially those involved in DNA repair and sex, overlap antisense long noncoding RNAs, which may participate in a regulatory mechanism. We demonstrate the utility of Auxenochlorella for fundamental research by knockout of a chlorophyll biosynthesis enzyme, and confirm one trisomy by allele-specific transformation. These results demonstrate the generality of several evolutionary forces associated with vegetative diploidy and provide a foundation for use of Auxenochlorella as a reference organism.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Disruption of this bond, particularly following offspring loss, can result in profound trauma with long-lasting consequences. While considerable research has focused on the impact of maternal separation on offspring development, the biological effects of offspring loss on the mother remain largely unexplored. In this study, we examined the long-term effects of offspring loss on neuroplasticity, the oxytocin (OXT) and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) systems, and stress-coping behaviors in Sprague-Dawley rat mothers. We examined two groups of lactating mothers: (I) a control group, in which dams remained with their pups until natural weaning, and (II) a separated group, in which all offspring were removed on lactation day 1 and the mothers experienced offspring loss until the time corresponding to weaning (19 days). Our results reveal that pup removal increased OXT receptor binding and reduced dendritic spine density in limbic brain regions, without altering estrogen receptor  or calbindin cell expression. Separated mothers additionally showed elevated plasma corticosterone levels and increased passive stress-coping behaviors in the forced swim test. Remarkably, passive stress-coping behavior was rescued by central CRF receptor blockade but not by OXT treatment, indicating that the CRF system plays a central role in the distress response to offspring loss.

However, as a nonparametric method that disregards spatial correlations, the Wilcoxon test can lead to inflated false positive rates and misleading findings. This limitation highlights the need for a more robust statistical approach that effectively incorporates spatial correlations. To this end, we propose a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) framework as a robust solution for differential gene expression analysis in ST. We conducted a comprehensive comparison of the GEE-based tests with existing methods, including the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and z-test. By appropriately accounting for spatial correlations, extensive simulations showed that the GEE test with robust standard error, referred to as the Independent GEE, demonstrated superior Type I error control and comparable power relative to other methods. Applications to ST datasets from breast and prostate cancer showed poor calibration of the p-values and potential false positive findings from the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

This enhancement has been shown to depend on the design of the pre-exposure phase. Here, we hypothesize that the deep successor representation (DSR), a recent computational model for cognitive map formation, can account for the modulation of latent learning because it is sensitive to the statistics of behavior during exploration. In our model, exploration aligned with the future reward location significantly improves reward learning compared to random, misdirected, or no exploration, as reported by experiments. This effect generalizes across different action selection strategies. We show that these performance differences follow from the spatial information encoded in the structure of the DSR acquired in the pre-exposure phase.

Many DNA lesions are targeted for removal by repair systems that excise the damage, thereby generating a temporary single-strand discontinuity in the chromosome. If DNA repair has not been completed prior to a round of genome duplication, the single-strand discontinuity (nick or gap) can be converted to a double-strand break (DSB) by an oncoming replication fork. Because the genomic location of nucleobase damage is stochastic, investigating the fate of replication machinery (replisome) at DNA repair sites with single-strand discontinuities has been limited. Here we have addressed this issue by expressing Cas9 nickases in Bacillus subtilis to create site specific single-strand discontinuities in a bacterial chromosome. We find that a nick in either leading or lagging strand arrests DNA replication, while the fate of the replicative helicase is distinct and depends upon the strand nicked. Genetic, biochemical, and single cell analyses indicate that replisome/nick encounters generate a single-end DSB which requires recombinational repair to enable PriA-dependent replication restart.

D.", "abstract": "Humans have a remarkable capacity to adjust reaching movements rapidly and accurately when visual targets jump to a new location. The short latency of such online corrections has led to the hypothesis that they constitute a distinct class of movement and arise from an automatic pilot that is selectively engaged only during ongoing movements. Here, we test this idea by measuring muscle recruitment, force, and kinematics in a jumping target reaching task. In separate blocks of trials, participants were instructed to respond to target jumps by (1) following the jumped target, (2) stopping the on-going movement, or (3) ignoring the jumped target. This allowed us to establish the automaticity and timing of responses to target jumps and to compare such measures to the original reaching movement initiated from rest. We find that the earliest phase of muscle recruitment elicited by the jumped target corresponds to a subcortical reflex, beginning at ~80ms and ending by ~120ms, preceding the onset of voluntary recruitment at ~130ms. This reflex inexorably drives a reaching adjustment towards the new target in all three blocks; it is only somewhat reduced in the stop and ignore blocks. Critically, this earliest phase of muscle recruitment was also present at the exact same latency (80ms) for the original reaching movement initiated from rest. Thus, rather than supporting the model of online corrections as distinct class of movement that is mediated by an automatic pilot, our results suggest that all reaches, whether adjusted in mid-flight or initiated from rest, arise from a common nested control system featuring subcortical and cortical components whose influence can be strategically preset by task demands. Our results also reinforce the importance of considering movement biomechanics when interpreting kinematic latency differences across movements made in different situations.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Recent methodological advances now allow deep insights into non-model host-parasite interactions, including intense reciprocal manipulations.

We identified host cell types and the molecular toolkits involved in host immunity and parasite virulence. Comparing blood cell-type specific transcriptomic profiles between hosts with low and high parasitaemia indicates tools of parasitic immune evasion and potential modulation of the host immune response. In line with the reportedly low pathogenicity of the parasite, the response of immune cells was overall low. This lack of antagonism likely represents a result of long-lasting coevolution. Our study illuminates in rare detail a rather benign non-model host-parasite interaction and bridges the large phylogenetic gap along the evolutionary gradient from parasitism to mutualism. The cell-type specific markers identified will be useful in advancing our understanding of the evolutionary forces shaping host immunity.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

In children, crowding is elevated foveally, with the estimated age where foveal crowding drops to adult-like levels varying widely from 5 to 12+ years. As crowding restricts key processes like reading, characterisation of this developmental trajectory is critical. Using methods optimised to measure crowding in children, adults and typically-developing children (n=119; 3-13 years) judged the orientation of a foveal 'VacMan' target either in isolation or surrounded by 'ghost' flankers. For isolated elements, acuity (measured as gap-size thresholds) dropped rapidly to adult-like levels at 5-6 years. Thresholds rose when flanked/crowded, with elevations highest at 3-4 years, persisting at 5-6 years, and dropping to adult-like levels at 7-8 years. A meta-analysis of our results and 13 prior studies reveals a consistent developmental trajectory, despite wide methodological variations. We further demonstrate that developmental crowding shows the same selectivity for target-flanker similarity as peripheral crowding, consistent with common mechanisms. This prolonged development reveals a shifting balance in the visual system between the processing of fine detail vs. the 'gist' of the scene.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Their fossil record suggests a first radiation in the Carboniferous following the End-Devonian Mass Extinction events. Conversely, recent phylogenetic hypotheses imply a radiation originating in the Late Devonian, but lack the taxonomic breadth required to robustly test this. This necessitates phylogeny-free inference of actinopterygian diversification rates from fossil occurrences, itself challenging due to uncertain taxonomies, incomplete occurrence databases, and severe spatiotemporal sampling biases. Here, we analyse a revised dataset of all known Palaeozoic actinopterygian genera and species using approaches that accommodate spatial and temporal sampling variation. We detect elevated actinopterygian diversification in the Late Devonian, with substantially greater lineage survival across the Hangenberg extinction event than indicated by the fossil record. Surprisingly, we detect no positive shifts in origination across the event, refuting previous hypotheses of explosive actinopterygian radiation in its wake. Cryptic lineage diversification is reflected by increased diversity across different geographic scales in the Carboniferous, although this is overwhelmingly driven by low palaeolatitude Euramerican fossil assemblages. Instances where local and global actinopterygian diversity patterns are decoupled highlight the geographic heterogeneity of their Palaeozoic radiation, providing focus for future research efforts.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

It is therefore currently unknown how coevolutionary cycling in allele frequencies affects the evolution of key disease characteristics, such as virulence. Here, we combine population genetic and quantitative genetic approaches to theoretically determine the impacts of coevolutionary cycling in allele frequencies on the evolution of virulence in a free-living parasite. By varying the level of genetic specificity required for infection while controlling for the average infection rate, we induce coevolutionary cycles and examine their effects on virulence evolution. We show that coevolutionary cycling does indeed have a strong impact on virulence evolution, with more specific infection genetics and higher allelic diversity generally driving larger and more rapid cycles in allele frequencies, leading to selection for higher virulence.

Current sequence-to-label methods typically employ the two-stage pipeline: (i) encoding mutant sequences using neural networks (e.g., transformers), followed by (ii) the {Delta}{Delta}G regression from the latent representations. Although these methods have demonstrated promising performance, their dependence on specialized neural network encoders significantly increases the complexity. Additionally, the requirement to individually compute latent representations for each mutant site negatively impacts computational efficiency and poses the risk of overfitting. This work proposes the Venus-MAXWELL framework, which reformulates mutation {Delta}{Delta}G prediction as a sequence-to-landscape task. In Venus-MAXWELL, mutations of a protein and their corresponding {Delta}{Delta}G values are organized into a landscape matrix, allowing our framework to learn the {Delta}{Delta}G landscape of a protein with a single forward and backward pass during training. Besides, to facilitate future works, we also curated a large-scale {Delta}{Delta}G dataset with strict controls on data leakage and redundancy to ensure robust evaluation. Venus-MAXWELL is compatible with multiple protein language models and enables these models for accurate and efficient {Delta}{Delta}G prediction. For example, when integrated with the ESM-IF, Venus-MAXWELL achieves higher accuracy than ThermoMPNN with 10x faster in inference speed (despite having 50x more parameters than ThermoMPNN).

This process, known as nuclear mechanotransduction, is an emerging field of research, and its deregulation can lead to severe human pathologies. In this study, we examine the behavior of female and male nuclei during sexual reproduction in the model fungus Podospora anserina. After plasmogamy, the two types of nuclei do not immediately undergo karyogamy. Instead, once inside the trichogyne (the female-specific hyphae extending from the ascogonium) the male nuclei migrate over distances of up to several hundred micrometers from the trichogyne tip, where plasmogamy occurs, to the ascogonium at the center of the protoperithecium. Our study highlights the contrasting behaviors of the two nuclear types: female nuclei remain immobile and spherical, while male nuclei move rapidly and exhibit striking deformations and stretching. Trichogynes are branched and compartmentalized, consisting of articles separated by septa that communicate through the septal pores. We show that during their migration across these compartments, male nuclei undergo the most extreme movements, deformations, and speeds reported to date for nuclei in motion. We also investigated the role of the actin and microtubule (MT) cytoskeletons in male nuclei behavior. Both cytoskeletal networks are highly dynamic and abundant in trichogynes, particularly at septa. We demonstrate that while actin depolymerization does not impair male nuclei migration, MT disruption causes a complete arrest of both nuclear movement and stretching, indicating a critical role for MTs. Finally, we reveal that the MT network in trichogynes is highly polarized, offering new insights into how male nuclei navigate within branched trichogynes.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

This includes activation of non-SOS stress pathways, motility, exopolysaccharide production, anaerobic respiration, and metabolic adaptation. These responses do not inhibit conjugation, suggesting they serve to maintain host homeostasis. Capsule expression blocks these responses by preventing conjugation, and also inhibits RP4 activation by physically blocking donor-recipient contact. Unexpectedly, RP4 overcomes this barrier by exploiting single-cell variation in recipient capsule thickness, successfully conjugating with thin-capsulated recipients.

To characterize the roles of CHD4 in {beta} cells, we generated Chd4 {beta}KO mice. Deletion of Chd4 substantially impaired the function of {beta} cells.

S.", "abstract": "Researchers often use more than one genetic method to estimate contemporary effective population size (Ne), but few formally combine multiple estimates despite the potential benefits for increasing precision. Maximizing these benefits requires an optimal, inverse-variance weighting scheme. A precondition for combining estimates is that they must be estimating the same parameter, which can be appropriate either for estimates using the same method applied to different time periods, or for estimates using different methods applied to the same time period. Previous approaches focused on var(Ne^) for weighting, but that is problematical because Ne^ is highly skewed and can be infinitely large. A new approach is described here using weights that are inversely proportional to var(1/Ne^). 1/Ne^ is the drift signal that Ne-estimation methods respond to, and its distribution is close to normal even when Ne^ assumes extreme values. Benefits are maximized under three general conditions: the estimators have approximately equal variances; they are uncorrelated or have weak positive correlations; individual estimates have low precision (i.e., if data are limited and/or true Ne is large). Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that: (1) existing theory allows robust estimates of var(1/Ne^) for the temporal and LD methods, which provide independent information about Ne -- both of which facilitate optimally combining those methods; (2) estimates for the LD and sibship methods are essentially uncorrelated when data are limited but can be strongly positively correlated in genomics-scale datasets. General theory predicting var(1/Ne^) for the sibship method is lacking, but values for specific scenarios have been published. New software (COMBONE) is introduced to calculate combined estimates.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

To fill this gap, we investigated the dynamics of somatosensory plasticity using a custom-built exoskeletal device that extended users' fingers by 10 cm. Across four time points, before, during (pre- and post-use), and after exoskeleton wear, participants completed a high-density proprioceptive mapping task to measure representations of biological and exoskeletal fingers. We observed three distinct phases of plasticity. First, wearing the exoskeleton led to a contraction of the perceived length of the biological finger. Second, after active use, the represented lengths of the biological and exoskeletal fingers stretched significantly, an effect absent when participants trained with a non-augmenting control device. Third, a post-removal aftereffect on the biological finger representation was observed. These results demonstrate that wearable augmentations are rapidly integrated into body representations, with dynamic proprioceptive adjustments shaped by structural and functional properties of the device.

CD8+ T cell phenotypes of tolerance and rejection have been previously reported in transplant and pregnancy, but the transcriptional states of donor and fetus-specific CD4+ T cells remain poorly defined. Here, we performed Single-cell RNA-sequencing on endogenous, antigen-specific CD4+ T cells across models of allogeneic heart transplants and naive or paternal skin-sensitized pregnancy. We identified expanded T follicular helper (Tfh) and non-follicular effectors in transplant rejection absent in tolerance. Naive pregnancy resulted in a modest expansion of effector clusters with transcriptional quiescence that mirrored virgin mice. Successful sensitized pregnancy resulted in expanded Tfh clusters consistent with increased fetal-specific antibodies and limited non-Tfh effector responses. Most striking were the extensive changes imposed on donor-specific Foxp3pos regulatory T cells (Tregs) resulting in the co-clustering together with Foxp3neg T conventional cells (Tconvs) in transplant tolerance and the emergence of a Foxp3neg Type I Regulatory cluster observed in pregnancy of sensitized dams.

We applied this model to spike trains from four visual areas (LGN, V1, V2, and MT) and found that the gain process is well described by an exponentiated power law, with increasing amplitude and slower decay at higher levels of the visual hierarchy.

Genes encode proteins whose functions are tightly coupled to their three-dimensional structures via non-bonded interactions. Since the late 1970s, the advent of macromolecular crystallography inspired the notion that structural knowledge alone could enable a lock-and-key approach to drug design. However, this framework has failed to catalyze a step-change in the generation of new chemical matter. Drug discovery continues to depend on costly and largely serendipitous screening campaigns. Our understanding of, and reasoning from, non-bonded interaction chemistry is still too limited. Compounding this is the scarcity of novel chemistry and infinitesimal coverage of the chemical combinatorial space by current experimental data. To alleviate these problems, we show that a machine learning model can successfully learn and infer the principles of non-bonded interactions in the drug-receptor space. A reductionist approach to training data led to a model generalizing drug-target interactions to truly novel chemical matter without suffering from memorization bias.

For ultrasound neuromodulation studies in mice, current transducers can successfully reach shallow and middle brain depths; however, accessing deep-brain regions, especially those near the lower skull bone, remains challenging due to skull-induced attenuation, reflection, and acoustic aberration. To address this issue, this study presents a machine learning-based computational framework for optimizing single-element transducer designs to achieve precise deep-brain targeting in a mouse model. This framework includes a surrogate model and an evolutionary optimization approach. The surrogate model, which consists of Random Forest regressor and classifier models, was trained on acoustic simulation results to predict acoustic performance from design parameters. A total of 72 simulations were performed across coronal and sagittal planes, systematically varying parameters of frequency (1-6 MHz), radius of curvature (5-7 mm), and f-number (0.58-1.0). Each design was evaluated using five performance metrics: focal length, focal shape, maximum pressure at the focal region, pressure maximum location, and sidelobe suppression. The surrogate was combined with an evolutionary algorithm, Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II, to perform multi-objective optimization and identify high-performing transducer designs. The optimized design resulted in more compact, symmetric focal regions and accurate energy delivery to deep targets, with minimal off-target exposure, even in the presence of complex skull anatomy. Results indicate that lower f-numbers, moderate radius of curvature, and higher frequencies facilitate precise deep brain targeting. Overall, this data-driven approach enables the effective design of single-element transducers for deep-brain neuromodulation in mice and provides a framework for designing transcranial transducers for other brain targets, potentially accelerating the clinical translation of focused ultrasound technologies.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Commonly, the progression from a benign plexiform neurofibroma (PNF) towards a deadly malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) involves a poorly understood glial-to-mesenchymal transition and the sequential loss of NF1, CDKN2A, and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Using an iPSC-derived neural crest (NC) model, we reproduced this malignant transformation through gene editing. NF1-CDKN2A double-knockout (2KO) NCs retained glial differentiation capacity and formed neurofibroma-like tumors in vivo, requiring inactivation of p14ARF and p16INK4a. Additional PRC2 loss (3KO) disrupted pluripotency and induced mesenchymal stem cell-like features in iPSCs an NCs. 3KO NCs suffered a global chromatin reprograming that silenced SOX10 preventing gliogenesis and activated neuro-mesenchymal programs. Gene signatures characterizing this glial-to-neuro-mesenchymal transition were recapitulated in human PNF-ANNUBP-MPNST tumors. 3KO NC spheres formed MPNST-like tumors in vivo upon nerve engraftment, genuinely mimicking an early-stage MPNST. We used the developed 3D NC spheroid models for the discovery of drugs targeting MPNSTs by performing a high-throughput screening of an epigenetic compound library. We found that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) exhibit selective efficacy in PRC2-deficient NC spheroids.

Better understanding of this process will help us identify potential drug targets acting directly on the vulnerable cell types and circuits. To elucidate how risk factors impact brain circuitry in relation to psychiatric phenotypes, we employed a clinically relevant mouse model of a severe psychiatric genetic risk factors - the 15q13.3 microdeletion. We developed a novel technique, Psych-TRAP, to label psychiatric behaviour-associated circuits at whole brain level and with cellular resolution. Using Psych-TRAP, we permanently labelled transiently active cells responding to a psychiatric-relevant behavior (social interaction) and quantified their densities across the whole brain. We validated Psych-TRAP by confirming activation in previously known brain areas involved in social interaction. Furthermore, we discovered that impaired social interaction behavior in 15q13.3 microdeletion mice was associated with alterations in the GABAergic component in the activated circuit, mainly mediated by reelin-positive neurons in the prefrontal cortex and by somatostatin-positive neurons in the somatosensory cortex. Thus, Psych-TRAP represents a robust technique to permanently label transiently active cells during behavior in psychiatric risk factor models for future circuit manipulations in an unbiased manner that will help to reveal the underlying molecular markers mediating psychiatric behaviours.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we present the earliest direct evidence of proboscidean butchery, including a newly documented elephant butchery site (EAK). This shift in behavior is accompanied by larger, more complex occupation sites, signaling a profound ecological and technological transformation.

Existing treatments are inconsistently effective, underscoring the importance of developing accurate models of the underlying neurobiology. Although there is consensus that the extended amygdala (EA) plays a central role in orchestrating responses to threat, the respective contributions of its two major subdivisions - the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) - remain contentious. To help adjudicate this debate, we performed a harmonized mega-analysis of fMRI data acquired from 295 adults as they completed a well-established threat-anticipation paradigm. Contrary to popular double-dissociation models, results demonstrated that the Ce responds to temporally uncertain threat and the BST responds to certain threat.

Here, we demonstrate that an albumin-STING nanoagonist (Nano ZSA-51D) reprograms HSPCs to generate antitumor neutrophils, enhancing MHC I-mediated CD8+ T cell immunity. Nano ZSA-51D activates STING-interferon signaling in HSPCs, promoting their expansion and differentiation toward granulocyte-monocyte progenitors via STING-NF-{kappa}B-IL-6 signaling.

These mechanisms are often confounded, yet dissociating them is essential for understanding neural circuit computations. We addressed this by performing two-photon calcium imaging from distinct cell types (excitatory, VIP, and SST) in layer 2/3 of the medial visual cortex (VIS) and the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) while awake mice passively viewed audio-visual stimuli under temporal contexts with different inter-stimulus interval (ISI) distributions. Computational modeling revealed distinct functional clusters of neurons, stimulus-activated (ramp-down) and stimulus-inhibited (ramp-up), with characteristic kinetics and area- and cell-type-specific biases. Importantly, all functional clusters were invariant to temporal predictability, shifted immediately when temporal statistics changed, and existed even in naive mice, findings inconsistent with predictions from temporal predictive processing frameworks. Elapsed-interval information could nonetheless be decoded, and heterogeneous kinetics underlay how well each cluster represented interval duration, leading to a distributed, learning-independent population code for time. These results demonstrate that activity in VIS and PPC arises from stimulus-evoked dynamics whose intrinsic evolution encodes elapsed time, rather than from temporal predictive processing, redefining the mechanistic origin of ramping and omission-related activity in visual and parietal cortices. We propose that temporal predictive processing may instead be implemented in other circuits or recruited in VIS/PPC during task-engaged behavior.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

During metastasis, stromal infiltration requires the cancer cells to form invadopodia, a membraneprotrusion with proteolytic activity. Cues from growth factors via the cognate RTKs promote invadopodia formation and cancer cell invasion. This study demonstrated the role of the HGFMET axis in invadopodia formation and associated protease trafficking. MET interacts with MT1-MMP and is co-transported to the cell surface. Further, the RTK is found to reside at invadopodia, and its recruitment increases upon HGF stimulation due to enhanced recycling mediated by RAB4 and RAB14. The study further highlights the role of RCP in MET recycling by bringing RAB14 and MET together onto endosomal subdomains. KIF16B, a molecular motor, gets recruited to MET-containing endosomes via RAB14 and promotes the endosomal tubulation, which could be crucial for MET recycling.

Both the females and males of Nup43 null mutant are sterile. In Nup43 mutants, embryonic development is halted at the first division stage, and males are sterile due to an arrest at the canoe stage of spermiogenesis.

It acts through competitive inhibition of natural ligand estrogen (E2) of estrogen receptor (ER), affecting ER interactions with other nuclear receptors, chromatin modulators, genomic structural proteins and co-regulators. Although tamoxifen inhibits the progression of breast cancer, it increases the risk of endometrial cancer, particularly in postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen could shift the DNA-binding signature of endometrial ER upon prolonged exposure during breast cancer, resembling the signature of endometrial ER in mammary cancer cells. Our laboratory had previously analyzed the progesterone receptor (PR) and ER cistromes of endometrial adenocarcinoma Ishikawa cells when treated with ovarian hormones, showing that ER binding sites are shared by PR in this endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line. This could explain, in part, progestin regulation of estrogen effects on ER/PR positive endometrial cancer cells. Here, we compared ER cistromes of endometrial tumors of both tamoxifen users and non-users with the ER and PR cistromes of the adenocarcinoma cell model. We found that ER cistrome of non-users is closer to transcriptionally active Ishikawa PR cistrome after R5020 treatment, while the ER cistrome of tamoxifen users is similar to Ishikawa ER cistrome after E2 treatment. These results indicate that tamoxifen treatment could change the ER chromatin landscape of endometrial tumor cells that can be occupied by PR in response to progestins. The subset of ERbs of non-users that could be shared by PR may regulate inflammatory signaling pathway genes. On the other hand, the subset of ERbs of tamoxifen users could modulate early estrogen response pathway genes. Within this pathway, NRIP1 emerged as a master regulator modified in tamoxifen users tumors.

While network science has developed various metrics to assess the degree of connectivity between these regions, it has not yet considered the level of activity within each region. Consequently, a highly connected region might be classified as a hub in the brain's connectome, even if it is weakly active or linked primarily to less active areas. Conversely, a region that is highly active but has only a few connections may be undervalued. To address this issue, we present a fully-weighted brain graph in which both edges (representing connectivity) and nodes (indicating metabolic activity) contribute to the importance, or centrality, of each region. In this model, the metabolism-weighted centrality (MwC) of each brain region integrates both connectivity and metabolic activity, using three datasets from simultaneously acquired functional MRI and metabolic FDG-PET data. We found that our fully-weighted brain graph demonstrates a greater ability to explain quantitative imaging data of signaling metabolism and its association with cognitive domains than a classical, edge-weighted graph. Additionally, regions with relatively high MwC exhibited increased synaptic and metabolic activity, as indicated by transcriptomic data. Furthermore, these regions showed higher susceptibility to neurodegenerative disorders. This framework of a fully-weighted brain graph represents a paradigm shift from connectivity-based metrics to an activity-aware brain graph.

In the colon, this barrier is repeatedly challenged by mechanical distension from faeces and it is unknown whether and how the colon adapts to such stress, which could otherwise compromise barrier integrity. Here, we show that faeces-mediated mechanical distension triggers coordinated remodelling at cell- and tissue-scale, suggestive of mechanoadaptation. This response includes recruitment of junctional proteins at all three types of adhesive cell-cell junctions (tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes). We identified two modes of recruitment: stable responders (ZO-1, E-cad, plakoglobin) with sustained junctional enrichment, and adaptive responders (desmoplakin, keratin 8) with progressive accumulation during distension. Distension was also accompanied by perijunctional recruitment and activation of non-muscle myosin II (NMMII). Through genetic, pharmacological, and mechanical perturbations, we demonstrated that NMMII activation is an early and critical step for mechanoadaptation. This process requires extracellular calcium influx, and Piezo1 activation is sufficient to trigger NMMII activation and junctional recruitment. Loss of NMMII function abrogated the junctional response to distension across all three junctional complexes, including desmosomes, resulting in disorganised junctions and barrier breach. Together, our findings uncover a robust physiological mechano-adaptive response of the adult colonic epithelium to an extrinsic mechanical stress, whereby coordinated reinforcement of all junctional complexes, controlled by myosin II and mechanosensitive calcium influx, plays an essential role in preserving intestinal barrier integrity.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

To replicate biological perception, two approaches have emerged: artificial nervous systems that utilize soft electronics as biomimetic receptors to convert external stimuli into frequency-encoded signals, and biohybrid solutions that integrate living cells, plants, or even live animals with electronic components to decode environmental cues for life-like sensations. However, most current biohybrid approaches for artificial sensation are based on eukaryotic cells, which suffer from slow growth, stringent culture conditions, environmental susceptibility, and short lifespans, thus limiting their integration into practical wearables or robotic sensory skins. Here, we introduce fungi-based printable \"Mycoelectronics\", which are created by additive bioprinting of living fungal mycelium networks onto stretchable electronics, as a practical living thermo-responsive sensory platform. This Mycoelectronics approach leverages fungis capacity for rapid biological responsiveness, cultivability with exponential growth, stability and self-healing in ambient conditions, bioprintability for scalable manufacturing, and mechanical flexibility for seamless integration with soft electronics. Critically, we discovered that the thermal responsiveness of the fungal network arises from intrinsic cellular processes--specifically, heat-induced vacuole remodeling and fusion, which modulate ionic transport and thus the electrical conductivity of the mycelial cells and networks, enabling a rapid temperature response. By bridging the gap between cell biology and soft electronics, the Mycoelectronics device with a living mycelium network functions as a thermal sensation system with rapid response and intrinsic self-healing properties, autonomously restoring sensing capabilities after damage or autonomously establishing sensor pathways in hard-to-reach locations.

Convergence and Extension (C&E) movements that elongate the anteroposterior axis initiate with precise timing during vertebrate gastrulation, but the mechanisms controlling their onset remain unknown. We examined this question using zebrafish embryonic explants that faithfully recapitulate C&E cell movements and their precise timing in culture, in isolation from other gastrulation movements. We determined that new transcription is required at gastrulation onset for C&E in explants and identified sulfatase modifying factor 2 (sumf2) as a candidate  trigger of C&E onset. sumf2 encodes for pFGE, the paralog and inhibitor of the Formylglycine Generating Enzyme (FGE, encoded by sumf1), which is the key activator of all sulfatase enzymes. In zebrafish embryos and explants, sumf1 expression declines just as sumf2 is expressed, leading to decreased sulfatase activity and increased sulfation of their heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) substrates. We found that overexpression of sumf1 and sumf2 causes delayed or precocious C&E onset, respectively, whereas mutations in sumf1 and sumf2 shift C&E timing in the opposite direction. We further identified Sulf1, an extracellular sulfatase that modifies HSPGs, as the key effector by which sumf1 and sumf2 control C&E timing. Accordingly, reduced or increased levels of sulfated heparan sulfate similarly shift C&E onset and suppress sumf1 and sumf2 mutant phenotypes. Together, our work supports a model in which sumf2 expression at zebrafish gastrulation onset reduces sulfatase activity, rewriting HSPG sulfation patterns to promote and/or permit C&E morphogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

To bridge the gap, we introduce Slogen, a Structure-based Lead Optimization algorithm unifying fragment Generation and screENing. To achieve this, Slogen integrates a transformer-based variational autoencoder, pretrained on the BindingNet v2 dataset, with an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network that models 3D protein-fragment interactions. This unified framework enables both fragment generation and similarity-based screening, simultaneously addressing synthetic tractability and structural diversity. The benchmarking study shows that Slogen matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while exploring broader chemical space.

However, whether skeletal muscle retains a \"memory\" of disuse remains unknown. We investigated repeated lower-limb immobilization in young adults and a refined aged rat model of repeated disuse, integrating multi-omics, histology, biochemistry, and primary human cell analyses. In young human muscle, a second period of disuse elicited an attenuated transcriptional response in oxidative and mitochondrial pathways, suggesting a protective molecular memory, although this did not translate into attenuated atrophy. In contrast, aged muscle exhibited a detrimental molecular memory, with greater atrophy, exaggerated suppression of aerobic metabolism genes/pathways despite recovery of these genes after initial disuse, depletion of NAD and mitochondrial DNA, and activation of proteasomal, extracellular matrix and DNA-damage pathways. Repeated disuse induced DNA hypermethylation and downregulation of aerobic metabolism and mitochondrial genes across species. NR4A1 remained suppressed in young human muscle, whereas acetylcholine receptor subunit genes were epigenetically primed in humans and further upregulated with repeated atrophy in both young and aged muscle. NMRK2 was among the most downregulated genes after both periods of atrophy in humans, and nicotinamide riboside improved myotube size in primary human muscle cells derived post-atrophy.

Its active moiety, manogepix, inhibits Gwt1 which is an enzyme essential for the assembly and attachment of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors to cell wall proteins. Manogepix has a strong fungistatic activity against most human pathogenic fungal species. Here we characterized the activity of manogepix against the major human pathogenic mold Aspergillus fumigatus. We show that manogepix susceptibility is linked to the expression of gwt1, the gene encoding Gwt1, thereby demonstrating that overexpression of gwt1 can confer resistance. In agreement with a previous study conducted with a different fungal pathogen, we observed an increase of cell well chitin after manogepix treatment. Using a luciferase-based reporter assay, we show that manogepix activates the cell wall integrity stress response pathway. However, manogepix only occasionally causes cell lysis. Mutants that lack the cell wall stress sensor Wsc1 or the Rho GTPase Rho4, which is important for septum formation, are slightly more susceptible to manogepix. In contrast, mutants that lack the Rho GTPase Rho2 or the cell wall stress sensor MidA, both of which are key for A. fumigatus to survive cell wall stress caused by granulocytes, heat and other cell wall perturbing chemical compounds, grow better than wild-type when exposed to manogepix. We show that both mutants, especially {Delta}rho2 but also {Delta}midA, fail to upregulate cell wall chitin to wild-type-like levels in response to manogepix. These results implicate a role for the Rho2-dependent stress response in the fungistatic activity of manogepix against A. fumigatus.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Such a process is called evolutionary branching in adaptive dynamics theory. In one-dimensional trait spaces, the existence of an evolutionary branching point ensures evolutionary branching of an asexual monomorphic population in its neighborhood under rare and small mutations. An evolutionary branching point is a convergence stable point (i.e., a point attractor for a monomorphic population through directional selection) that is not an ESS (evolutionarily stable strategy). For analysis of arbitrary higher-dimensional trait spaces with respect to evolutionary branching induced by convergence stable non-ESSes, this study develops two kinds of criteria. The two criteria, referred to as branching possibility and branching inevitability, are based respectively on the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics theory and on the local Lyapunov function. The branching possibility ensures the existence of evolutionary paths achieving evolutionary branching. The branching inevitability ensures steady progress of evolutionary branching through repeated invasions by arbitrary mutants having positive invasion fitnesses, even when the timescale separation between population dynamics and evolutionary dynamics is incomplete.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Yet different models applied to identical structures generate divergent outputs. These systematic differences reflect training data characteristics rather than random variation, but their patterns and malleability remain uncharacterised. We quantified how training data modality shapes systematic preferences across six architectures. Structure-conditioned models retain minimal unexplained taxonomic variance (<3%) after controlling for measurable protein properties, while sequence-only models show substantial residual taxonomic dependence (19-25%). This difference stems from distinct preference patterns: Structure-conditioned models favour compactness and stability, properties enriched in experimentally tractable structures; sequence-only models bias reflect organism identity more heavily when evaluating sequence quality. These systematic preferences constrain design space exploration in predictable ways. Generated sequences converge toward model-specific biophysical profiles, with both input template properties and training-derived preferences jointly determining outcomes. Fine-tuning demonstrates these patterns are malleable: training ProteinMPNN on alkaline-adapted proteins redirects preferences toward elevated isoelectric points and basic residue content while preserving structural compatibility. Systematic bias characterisation enables both prediction of design outcomes and strategic modification for target applications.

D.", "abstract": "We understand how neurons respond selectively to patterns in visual input to support object recognition; however, how these circuits support perceptual grouping, illusory percepts, and imagination is not understood. These perceptual experiences are thought to require combining what we have learned about the world with incoming sensory signals, yet the neural mechanism for this integration remains unclear. Here we show that networks tuned for object recognition implicitly learn the distribution of their input, which can be accessed through feedback connections that tune synaptic weights. We introduce Generative Inference, a computational framework in which feedback pathways that adjust connection weights during learning are repurposed during perception to combine learned knowledge with sensory input, fulfilling flexible inference goals such as increasing confidence. Generative Inference enables networks tuned solely for recognition to spontaneously produce perceptual grouping, illusory contours, shape completion, and pattern formation resembling imagination, while preserving their recognition abilities. The framework reproduces neural signatures observed across perceptual experiments: delayed responses in feedback-receiving layers of early visual cortex that disappear when feedback connections are disrupted. We show that, under stated assumptions, gradients of classification error approximate directions that are informative about the data distribution, establishing a theoretical connection between recognition and generation. Together, these findings show that pattern recognition and pattern generation rely on a shared computational substrate through dual use of feedback pathways. This principle explains how neural systems recognize familiar objects reliably while remaining flexible enough to interpret incomplete or ambiguous information, and suggests that reusing learning signals for perception may be a general feature of both biological brains and artificial networks.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) RT may preferentially spare normal tissue while maintaining tumor control. This study evaluates the impact of single-fraction and multi-fraction thoracic FLASH RT on lymphocyte preservation, apoptosis, and immunosuppressive signaling in mice. Methods: We compared the immunological impact of thoracic FLASH RT and CONV RT in C57BL/6 mice using single-fraction (17 Gy) and multi-fraction (2 Gy x 5) regimens using the Mobetron (IntraOp). Longitudinal blood sampling was performed at multiple time-points post-irradiation through facial vein bleed with flow cytometry analysis for CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and NK cells to assess lymphocyte counts, apoptotic lymphocytes through Annexin V staining, and immune suppression by examining regulatory T cells (Tregs) and PD-1/PD-L1 expression. Mechanistic studies included immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses of splenic tissues to evaluate Chk1 and STAT3 signaling pathways. Results: In single-fraction RT, FLASH significantly reduced lung and heart fibrosis (p < 0.0001) at 28 weeks post-RT. The FLASH effect was also seen acutely on circulating immune cells, with significantly reduced lymphocyte apoptosis and accelerated recovery of CD4+, CD8+, CD3+, NK, and B cell populations compared to CONV RT in both single-fraction and multi-fraction regimens. Conversely, CONV RT induced long-lasting increases in Tregs and sustained PD-1 and PD-L1 expression on T- and B-cells at 2- and 5-months post-irradiation in both fractionation regimens. Within the spleen, we also found CONV RT induced sustained activation of the Chk1-STAT3 pathway in CD45+ immune cells, which correlates with increased PD-1/PD-L1 expression. Conclusion: FLASH RT mitigates RIL, reduces lymphocyte apoptosis, and prevents long-term immunosuppression by reduced activation of the Chk1-STAT3 pathway. These findings suggest FLASH RT may confer immunological advantages over CONV RT to enhance therapeutic efficacy.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Recombination facilitates the generation of defective viral genomes (DVGs), truncated derivatives of the parental genome that require a helper virus to replicate. Recombination mechanisms are poorly understood for viruses with double-stranded RNA genomes. Two strains of the double-stranded RNA virus reovirus differ in the pattern of packaged DVGs during serial passage. To determine whether the polymerase complex or gene segment sequence contributes to these differences, we exchanged polymerase complexes between the two reovirus strains. We identified DVG patterns using RT-PCR and recombination junction profiles using ClickSeq. Reoviruses synthesized DVGs that maintained the 5' and 3' termini and contained large central deletions. The polymerase complex did not detectably affect DVG pattern following reovirus serial passage or viral recombination junction profiles. Instead, recombination junction profiles correlated with the identity of viral RNA gene segments, even in the presence of a non-native polymerase complex or virus background. Reovirus recombination junction start and stop sites often occur in regions of sequence microhomology. While we observed many instances of short stretches of identical nucleotides within a viral gene segment, only a select few positions were incorporated into recombination junctions. Overall, these data suggest that recombination events that can mediate reovirus DVG formation are highly selective, and properties of viral gene segments primarily dictate where recombination occurs. These observations suggest a model for double-stranded RNA virus recombination in which the polymerase pauses RNA synthesis and re-initiates further along the same template at a specific junction stop site that has sequence homology to the junction start site.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we derive a biologically realistic mean-field model of a canonical three-population E-PV-SOM circuit. This model robustly generates oscillations whose features are consistent with experimental observations, including the relative timing of PV and SOM activity and the effects of optogenetic perturbations. By reducing the model to a linear analytical form, we demonstrate that gamma oscillations emerge directly from the cell-specific connectivity of the three-population circuit. This connectivity motif alone accounts for experimentally observed phase relationships, with PV activity consistently leading that of SOM neurons.

To capture complementary dimensions of emotional and defensive responding, we employed the elevated plus maze (EPM) to quantify anxiety related measures and ethological risk assessment postures (e.g., stretch attend) and the marble burying (MB) test to index repetitive/defensive behavior; together these assays provide convergent but distinct readouts that increase sensitivity to cannabinoid induced effects. In the EPM, prenatal CBD exposure selectively increased stretch-attend postures in females, indicating heightened risk assessment; males were unaffected, and THC produced no comparable effect. Classical EPM indices-time in open or closed arms, preference for open-arms, and total distance traveled-were unchanged across groups, except that THC-exposed females exhibited hyperlocomotion. In contrast, marble burying was increased in both sexes following prenatal exposure to either CBD or THC, indicating a shared enhancement of repetitive/defensive responses.

In Parkinson disease (PD), widespread alterations in the basal ganglia circuitry lead to an E/I imbalance in the striatum, contributing to excitotoxicity. Leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has recently emerged as a key contributor to both familial and sporadic forms of PD, with the pathogenic Gly2019Ser (G2019S) mutation representing one of the most frequently observed variants. This mutation is known to exacerbate excitotoxicity by impairing glutamate reuptake mechanisms, particularly through dysregulation of EAAT2 activity and its membrane localization. In contrast, the role of LRRK2 in GABAergic transmission remains poorly understood. Here, we reveal a clear modulation of inhibitory signaling by LRRK2 through a comprehensive approach combining mouse striatal slices and Xenopus laevis oocytes. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that LRRK2 G2019S induces a significant reduction in GABA- evoked current amplitudes. Moreover, we identified an altered distribution of receptor isoforms in pathological tissue, affecting both tonic and phasic GABA currents. Specifically, synaptic GABAA receptors containing the {gamma}2 subunit were functionally modulated by LRRK2 G2019S. The reduced availability of gephyrin in the presence of the G2019S variant may impair the gephyrin- GABAA receptor complex, leading to decreased receptor surface expression and further shifting the glutamate/GABA current ratio toward excitatory dominance. This is supported by the increased activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors observed in the pathological striatum. Overall, our findings highlight a previously underappreciated role of LRRK2 G2019S in impairing GABAergic transmission and disrupting the E/I balance.

We found widespread and heterogeneous deviations from the normative model, with the language network emerging as the most significantly altered region, thereby emerging as an epicenter of functional disruption in autism. Individuals with autism were clustered into three subtypes involving distinct functional network topologies, associated with behavioral profiles marked by impairments in perception, language processing, or socio-emotional functioning. We further linked these atypical brain features to cortical gene expression patterns, revealing enriched pathways related to neurodevelopment, language, and signaling processes. Together, these findings reveal autism-specific deviations in individualized functional brain networks, offering potential clinical relevance for understanding and stratifying autism.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

We found a strong excitatory influence of the right cerebellum on the bilateral V5, which increased during the visuomotor adaptation > no adaptation tasks. Furthermore, there was an increased mutual excitation among the cerebellar hemispheres, and an inhibition of the cerebella by the V5, during visuomotor adaptation. These results are consistent with the idea that the cerebellum implements forward models predicting the sensory consequences of actions, and communicates these predictions to other regions of the visuomotor control hierarchy.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

While both genetic and environmental factors contribute to ASD, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions remain unclear. In a recent preprint, we showed that cytokine signaling may be dysregulated in chromosome 15q-duplication syndrome (Dup(15q)), one of the most common syndromic forms of ASD. Specifically, Dup(15q) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived neurons exhibit an amplified Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-3 (STAT3) response to Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory cytokine often upregulated in ASD. To identify which gene in the 15q region may be responsible for modifying cytokine signalling responses in Dup(15q), we focus on the Cytoplasmic FMRP-Interacting Protein 1 (CYFIP1) gene, as increased CYFIP1 dosage in Dup(15q) is associated with increased severity of neurobehavioral symptoms in individuals with Dup(15q) and CYFIP1 dysregulation has been linked to altered expression of various genes involved in immunoregulatory signalling pathways. Here, we explore the effects of CYFIP1 overexpression (CYFIP1-OE) on cytokine signaling, demonstrating that CYFIP1-OE in HEK293 cells modifies the expression and activity of several cytokine signaling-related transcription factors, including STAT3 and STAT1. Additionally, we use SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells to assess neuron-related phenotypes, showing that CYFIP1-OE alters IL-6-induced neurite outgrowth. These findings provide novel insights into how CYFIP1 may contribute to dysregulated cytokine responses in ASD, advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie neuroinflammatory processes in this disorder.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

S.; Sundar, S.; Parulekar, N.; Krishnan, A.", "abstract": "Sequencing and syntax in complex animal vocal signals have been studied using several mathematical analyses. Commonly, sequences of vocalizations are assumed to follow a first-order Markov process, where each state depends on the state immediately before it. However, more recent computational analyses challenge this assumption, suggesting alternative processes may be important in vocal sequences. Open-ended vocal learners such as parrots possess complex, variable vocal sequences that may be dynamically modified throughout their lives and contain information about group membership and identity. Although this makes them important systems in which to identify general patterns within vocal sequences, parrot vocalizations remain generally understudied compared to passerine birds. Here, we examined vocal sequence structure in six species of parrots (Psittaculidae). We fit various metrics of sequence structure to those generated by multiple simulated processes, including Markov, random, hidden Markov and renewal processes. Two metrics exhibited the best fit to a renewal process (where a note repeats a certain number of times before transitioning to a new note), and two others to Markov processes. Importantly, all analyses were broadly concordant across species, and multiple metrics indicated an elevated probability of note repetition. Reconciling these results, we suggest a general vocal mechanism across the highly variable vocal sequences of parrots, where both note repetition and Markov processes are important. Note repetition patterns could help communicate individual or group identity, as well as social and behavioral context. Our study thus extends a simulation-based approach using diverse metrics to comparatively examine the complex, variable vocal sequences of these open-ended vocal learners.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that maternal high fat (HF) diet and viral infection would independently induce placental inflammation and lipid peroxidation, while reducing antioxidant defence, and cellular turnover. Further, HF diet would compromise the placenta's capacity to adapt to a secondary stressor, which would exacerbate these effects. Female C57BL/6J mice were fed a control (CON) or 62% HF diet six weeks before and throughout pregnancy and injected with the viral mimic, poly(I:C) or vehicle (VEH) 24h before sacrifice at gestational days (GD) 12.5, 15.5, and 18.5 (n=5-8/group/GD). Placental inflammasome (NLRP3), oxidative stress (4-HNE), antioxidant defence (GPx-4), and cellular turnover (Ki-67, Caspase-3) were assessed by immunohistochemistry quantifying immunoreactive (ir) expression levels. mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators (Tlr3, Irf3, Tlr4, Tirap, and Il-1{beta}) were measured by qPCR. Data were analysed by generalized linear mixed models (p<0.05). At GD12.5, infection, but not HF diet, was associated with increased Tlr3 mRNA and ir-4-HNE, and reduced ir-GPx-4 expression in the placental labyrinth zone (LZ). By GD15.5, HF diet was associated with increased ir-NLRP3 in both LZ and junctional zones (JZ), with co-exposure to HF diet and infection further increasing LZ ir-NLRP3. At GD18.5, HF diet, but not viral infection, was associated with increased Tirap and Il-1{beta} mRNA expression, ir-4-HNE in the JZ and ir-Caspase-3 in the LZ. Together, these findings show that maternal HF diet and infection exert distinct yet interacting effects on the placenta across gestation. Their combined exposure can amplify inflammatory and oxidative pathways, suggesting that maternal overnutrition reduces the placenta's capacity to handle adverse exposures, which may increase susceptibility to poor fetal outcomes.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in disease-associated reactive microglia is increasingly recognized as a key pathogenic driver and a promising therapeutic target in synucleinopathies. Dapansutrile (OLT1177(R)) is a selective, orally bioavailable NLRP3 inhibitor with a favorable safety profile in clinical trials for non-neurological indications. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of dapansutrile in preclinical models of PD and MSA and explored the predictive and translational value of its effects. Methods: Two established mouse models of synucleinopathy with nigral neurodegeneration were employed: the -synuclein preformed fibril (PFF) propagation model and the transgenic PLP--syn model expressing human wild-type -synuclein in oligodendrocytes. Pharmacokinetic analyses assessed plasma and brain exposure after oral administration. The efficacy of six-month dapansutrile treatment was examined in both preventive (post-PFF injection) and therapeutic (PLP--syn mice) paradigms, using behavioral, histopathological, and molecular readouts. Transcriptomic profiling of striatal and midbrain microglia identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with treatment and compared them with post-mortem transcriptomic signatures of disease-associated microglia in PD patients. Plasma IL-18 and neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels were evaluated as translational biomarkers. Results: Chronic oral dapansutrile treatment at clinically relevant doses improved motor performance, reduced -synuclein inclusions, attenuated gliosis, and mitigated nigral neurodegeneration in both models. Microglial transcriptomic analyses revealed that dapansutrile reversed key transcriptional signatures characteristic of PD-associated reactive microglia. Moreover, plasma IL-18 and NfL levels correlated with neuropathological and functional outcomes, supporting their potential as biomarkers of target engagement and treatment efficacy. Conclusions: These data identify chronic NLRP3 activation as a shared and targetable mechanism in PD and MSA and highlight dapansutrile as a CNS-penetrant, clinically advanced candidate for disease modification in -synucleinopathies. The observed transcriptomic reprogramming of microglia and the parallel changes in blood biomarkers provide a strong translational bridge to clinical development.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Existing foundation models for single-cell analysis typically embed cells as continuous vectors, limiting their generative flexibility and hindering integration with the knowledge accumulated in large language models (LLMs). In this work, we present CellTok, a multimodal LLM framework for unified analysis of scRNA-seq data and biological text. Each cell is tokenized into discrete codebook tokens via VQ-VAE and integrated into the LLM's vocabulary using early fusion. This allows CellTok to process biological and textual inputs autoregressively, leveraging pretrained knowledge within LLMs to analyze cellular states and interactions. CellTok demonstrates strong performance in cell-level tasks such as annotation and generation, and enables previously unattainable large population-level tasks, including accurate prediction of intercellular communication networks, which is a key mechanism in tissue organization and disease. Furthermore, it retains interactive Q&A capabilities grounded in biomedical knowledge, offering a new paradigm for analyzing complex cellular systems.

Resistance to small-molecule inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade highlights the need for new mechanistically distinct interventions. Catestatin (CST), a Chromogranin A (CgA)-derived peptide with immunomodulatory and reparative properties, has been implicated in tissue protection, but its role in melanoma remains unknown. Methods. CST expression was analyzed across melanoma stages and correlated with disease progression. Functional effects of CST were assessed in patient-derived and established melanoma cell lines, as well as in B16-F10 melanoma-bearing mice. RNA sequencing and pathway analyses were performed to delineate CST-regulated molecular networks. Vemurafenib-resistant A375 cells were used to examine the effects of CST on drug resistance mechanisms. Results. CST expression declined with advancing tumor stage. CST treatment inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion, while inducing apoptosis in melanoma cells but not in normal fibroblasts. In vivo, systemic CST administration significantly reduced tumor volume and mass. Transcriptomic profiling revealed coordinated downregulation of hypoxia-inducible, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and collagen-remodeling pathways, alongside suppression of oxidative stress-adaptive signaling. In Vemurafenib-resistant A375 cells, CST restored apoptotic sensitivity and repressed multiple MAPK and PI3K-AKT-linked resistance genes. Conclusions. CST acts as a mechanistically distinct peptide modulator that reprograms oncogenic signaling through inhibition of hypoxia, EMT, and survival pathways. These findings identify CST as a promising therapeutic prototype for mitigating melanoma progression and overcoming resistance to targeted therapy.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Modulation of serine levels via diet can influence relevant phenotypes in mouse models of metabolic syndrome.

We show that SDS is expressed and active in human liver tissue. Furthermore, Sds abundance strongly correlates with hepatic serine. This enzyme is highly active in BKS-db/db mice, which show amino acid alterations reminiscent of type 2 diabetes. Hepatic Sds overexpression increases serine and threonine degradation and promotes the accumulation of toxic 1-deoxysphingolipids (doxSLs). Conversely, Sds deletion dramatically increases systemic serine, glycine, and threonine while altering canonical and non-canonical sphingolipids. Finally, Sds deletion in BKS-db/db mice reduces skin doxSLs and accelerates wound healing.

HLA-B*07:02+ individuals living with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and progressive MS (PMS) were characterized by a relative reduction in EBNA6-specific and MAG-specific CD8 T cells compared to healthy donors.

Female RRMS patients were moreover characterized by a specific reduction of laEBV-specific CD8 T cells compared to male RRMS patients. NAg-specific CD8 T cells recognized heterogeneous peptides, were of low cellular frequency in peripheral blood, and exhibited a circulating, naive-like, anergic phenotype.

Although it is known to be primarily due to oogenic and early embryonic failures, the molecular mechanisms underlying these failures remain elusive. The Piwi-piRNA pathway is crucial for gametogenesis in diverse organisms. Yet, its role in mammalian female fertility is unclear. This is partly because most studies are done in mice, which contain only PIWIL1, PIWIL2, and PIWIL4 that are essential for spermatogenesis but not for oogenesis. PIWIL3 emerges in higher mammals and is highly expressed in human oocytes. Interestingly, female PIWIL3-knockout golden hamsters exhibit only reduced fertility without detectable defects in oogenesis. This has left the function of PIWIL3 in higher mammals, including humans, unexplored. Here, we discovered that PIWIL3 in the rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) shares high homology with human PIWIL3. It is the predominant PIWI protein in oocytes in both species. Using CRISPR-cas9 mediated knockout, we demonstrated that rabbit PIWIL3 is essential for female fertility. Its loss leads to severe defects in oogenesis. Moreover, embryos lacking maternal PIWIL3 arrest developmentally at the 8-cell stage. Mechanistically, rabbit PIWIL3 binds ~18-nucleotide piRNAs, mirroring the behavior of human PIWIL3, and is critical for piRNA biogenesis. Moreover, it regulates transcriptomic and proteomic landscapes and silences a broad array of transposons during late oogenesis yet activates another set of transposons during early embryogenesis. These findings establish PIWIL3 as a pivotal dual regulator of gene expression and transposon activity, which is essential for oogenesis and early embryogenesis in non-rodent mammals, potentially including humans.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we obtained several clean stocks by independently rescuing recombinant Sendai virus (SeV) six times and verified their cleanliness through PCR, RNA sequencing, and absence of immunostimulatory activity. High multiplicity-of-infection passaging of clean stocks produced six high-MOI passaged stocks, each with distinct cbVG populations.

Few common breaks were observed between stocks, while there was a hot rejoin region near the trailer end. In each stock, a few cbVGs species dominated and remained stable across passages, all conforming to the 'rule of six', regardless of length. Low-abundance cbVGs were variable across passages, indicating the continuous generation of new cbVGs, despite the stabilization of a subset of species.

AR involves complex three-dimensional deformations; however, its geometric characteristics and regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, using the chordate Ciona robusta (Ciona intestinalis type A), we demonstrate that AR consists of two components--leftward bending and clockwise twisting along the anterior-posterior axis--differentially regulated by TGF-{beta} signaling. A comparison between chorionated and dechorionated embryos revealed that dechorionation randomized the bending direction, while twisting remained consistently clockwise. Inhibition of TGF-{beta} signaling with SB431542 randomized both deformations. Quantitative analysis of twisting angles indicated uniform clockwise twisting along the axis, peaking during the tailbud stage and proceeding in the tail region, independent of the tip, trunk, or myofibril patterning. Although overall twisting was reduced under TGF-{beta} inhibition, the tail exhibited disorganized twisting. The sum of absolute twisting-angle differences in every 10 m remained comparable to the wild type (WT). This suggests that twisting is intrinsically generated, while TGF-{beta} signaling aligns local twisting into a coordinated global direction. Our findings dissected the mechanisms of AR in Ciona and highlight the multilayered regulation underlying the morphogenesis of the chordate body plan and providing a foundation for understanding its biomechanical and molecular bases.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

The Foxe3-Cre enables efficient deletion of Pax6 throughout the entire lens by embryonic day E12.5. Our study shows that Pax6 loss causes a delay in lens differentiation, disrupts the lens epithelium, and produces a smaller lens that remains attached to the cornea, ultimately leading to a rudimentary lens in adulthood.

We find that spinal neurogenesis follows a hierarchical organisation in which the neural tube first partitions into five broad subdivisions that resolve into the eleven progenitor domains generating the cardinal neuronal classes. This bifurcating architecture implies a patterning mechanism of sequential binary decisions. The most prominent lineage restriction occurs at the embryonic alar-basal boundary, separating sensory-processing from motor-control circuits. Individual progenitors generate neurons across multiple temporal waves while remaining constrained within their lineage subdivision, demonstrating persistence of spatial identity despite temporal competence changes. Among sensory populations, we identify two developmental routes, via unifated or bifated progenitors, to pain- and itch-processing interneurons. These principles are conserved between chick and human, with clonal analysis in human embryos revealing that most fate choices are resolved by six weeks post-conception. Together, these findings provide a framework for spinal cord development and reveal lineage compartmentalisation as a fundamental principle in neural circuit assembly and evolution.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

We asked how genotype and sex shape this process by exposing Oregon-R (wild-type) and vestigial (wing-deficient) Drosophila of both sexes to chronic paraquat (0, 10, or 20 mM) and tracking climbing performance from day 5 to 50, alongside survival. Paraquat impaired locomotion in a dose-dependent manner, with effects modified by genotype and sex (four-way ANOVA, all p < 0.001). Under control conditions, behavioral half-life (T50) occurred at 21.4 days in Oregon-R males and 25.7 days in females; vestigial flies declined earlier (males 14.8, females 18.3 days). At 20 mM, T50 fell by ~48-53% across groups. The female advantage persisted at 10 mM but narrowed at 20 mM, especially in vestigial flies. Survival changes mirrored functional decline: the interval between T50 and median lifespan compressed under severe stress ({approx}18-28 days in controls vs. 8-12 days at 20 mM), and functional-survival coupling was strong (r = 0.87, p < 0.001). Together, these data indicate that oxidative stress accelerates functional aging in patterns shaped by genotype and sex and support climbing performance as a practical predictor of healthspan.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

The IC50 values of PSS and PL were evaluated using the MTT assay, and their effects on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis induction were examined. RT-qPCR was performed to analyze the expression of proliferation-related genes following treatment with PSS and PL. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were also treated with these extracts to assess gene expression related to macrophage polarization, and macrophages tumoricidal activity was measured using CFDA-SE-labeled cancer cells. In addition, an animal tumor xenograft model was employed to determine the in vivo efficacy of PSS and PL. The results revealed that both PSS and PL exerted cytotoxic effects on colorectal, prostate, and kidney cancer cell lines. PSS induced G2 phase arrest in all colorectal cancer cell lines but not in PC3 cells and showed a mild effect on apoptosis induction in colorectal and prostate cancer cells. The inhibition of proliferation was partly associated with the downregulation of genes involved in cancer progression by both PL and PSS. Moreover, PL and PSS interfered with cancer supernatant-stimulated macrophages, upregulating M1-associated genes and downregulating M2-associated genes. In vivo, PSS reduced tumor volume in HCT116 cell-injected mice, and co-incubation of fluorescently labeled HCT116 cells with TAMs and PSS decreased fluorescence intensity, whereas PL alone did not exhibit these effects. Collectively, these findings indicate that both PL and PSS inhibit cancer cell proliferation in vitro, but only PSS demonstrated significant antitumor activity in vivo.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

In this study, baryzoites of T. gondii, N. caninum and B. besnoiti generated through exposure of tachyzoites to 2.5 {micro}M BKI-1708 were comparatively assessed. TEM showed that baryzoites contained multiple nuclei, clustered together and separated from the cytoplasmic organelles of newly formed zoites. These zoites do not have outer tachyzoite plasma membrane, were unable to complete cytokinesis, remained intracellular, and were enclosed by a parasitophorous vacuole membrane. TEM demonstrated the presence of an electron-dense cyst wall-like components only in T. gondii baryzoites. Species-specific differences in antigen expression were observed by immunofluorescence using specific antibodies. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed consistent downregulation of ribosomal proteins, proteins associated with secretory organelles, as well as of transcription and translation factors in all baryzoites. Bradyzoite-specific markers were upregulated only in T. gondii baryzoites. In addition, common orthologues of two alveolin-domain filament proteins (IMC7 and IMC12) and a hypothetical protein (TGME49_236950, NCLIV_050850, BESB_060040) were detected at higher abundance in all treated parasites. Overall, baryzoites exhibit distinct phenotypic and proteomic profiles, with ambiguous expression of tachyzoite and bradyzoite antigens, and lacking complete cellular division under drug pressure, suggesting a reversible response to stress rather than progression into a fully differentiated form.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Preclinical models play a crucial role in understanding stroke pathophysiology and evaluating potential treatments. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive characterization of the temporal evolution of ischemic injury induced by malonate intracerebral injection using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with histological and molecular analysis. Methods: Focal ischemic lesions were induced by malonate injection in the striatum of rats. Lesion volume was monitored using T2-weighted MRI at multiple time points (Day 1, D7, D14, D28, and D56). Water content, reflecting vasogenic edema, was assessed via apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements, while vascular alterations were evaluated using blood volume fraction (BVF), vessel radius, and oxygen saturation (StO2). Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability was quantified through gadolinium-enhanced MRI. Molecular analyses by RT-qPCR were conducted to assess oxidative stress, inflammation, and angiogenesis-related gene expression. Immunohistological staining was performed to investigate neuronal loss, astrocytic activation, and vascular remodeling. Results: MRI analysis showed a significant and progressive decrease in lesion volume. Water content increased from D4 onward. Ischemic injury significantly altered vascular function, leading to increased vessel radius and BVF while reducing tissue oxygenation. BBB permeability was elevated at D7 and D56, accompanied by increased claudin-1 and aquaporin-1 expression. Molecular analysis revealed an upregulation of inflammatory markers (IL-6, TGF-{beta}, NF-{kappa}B), oxidative stress response genes (SOD1, Nrf1), and impaired angiogenesis with increased Ang1/Ang2 but reduced VEGF/VEGFR1. Immunohistological analysis demonstrated neuronal loss, astrocytic activation, and vascular remodeling, characterized by increased ZO-1 and ColI-IV expression. Conclusion: The observed changes in lesion volume, vascular function, inflammation, oxidative stress, and angiogenesis highlight key mechanisms underlying post-stroke recovery. These findings emphasize the importance of long-term monitoring in preclinical stroke models and may contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Chronic stress can cause structural alterations like grey matter atrophy in key emotion-related areas such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). To identify biological pathways affected by chronic stress in the PFC, researchers have performed transcriptional profiling (RNA-sequencing, microarray) to measure gene expression in rodent models. However, transcriptional signatures in the PFC that are shared across different chronic stress paradigms and laboratories remain relatively unexplored. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of publicly available transcriptional profiling datasets within the Gemma database. We identified six datasets that characterized the effects of either chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) or chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) on gene expression in the PFC or medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mice (n=117). We fit a random effects meta-analysis model to the chronic stress effect sizes (log(2) fold changes) for each transcript (n=21,379) measured in most datasets. We then compared our results with two other published chronic stress meta-analyses, as well as transcriptional signatures associated with psychiatric disorders. Results: We identified 133 genes that were consistently differentially expressed across chronic stress studies and paradigms (false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05). Fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (fGSEA) revealed 53 gene sets enriched with differential expression (FDR <0.05), dominated by glial and neurovascular markers (e.g., oligodendrocyte, astrocyte, endothelial/vascular) and stress-related signatures (e.g., major depressive disorder, hormonal responses). Immediate-early gene markers of neuronal activity (Fos, Junb, Arc, Dusp1) were consistently suppressed. Many of the identified effects resembled those seen in previous meta-analyses characterizing stress effects (CSDS, early life stress), despite minimal overlap in included samples. Moreover, some of the differential gene expression resembled previous observations from stress-related psychiatric disorders , including alcohol abuse disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that chronic stress induces a robust, cross-paradigm PFC signature characterized by down-regulation of glia/myelin and vascular pathways and suppression of immediate-early gene activity, highlighting cellular processes linking chronic stress exposure, PFC dysfunction, and the onset of psychiatric disorders.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

We previously showed that UFMylation, the covalent attachment of the ubiquitin-fold modifier UFM1 to proteins, enhances RIG-I signaling by promoting its interaction with its membrane-targeting adaptor 14-3-3{epsilon}. Here, we map UFM1 conjugation to lysines K50 and K215 on 14-3-3{epsilon} and demonstrate how these UFMylation events control RIG-I signaling. Using in vitro and cellular UFMylation assays, we reveal that K50R/K215R mutations abolish UFMylation and reduce type I and III interferon induction following RIG-I activation. Unexpectedly, these mutations do not disrupt 14-3-3{epsilon}-RIG-I interaction. Instead, they paradoxically enhance RIG-I interaction with MAVS while simultaneously reducing 14-3-3{epsilon}-MAVS interaction. These findings establish UFMylation of 14-3-3{epsilon} as an important control that shapes MAVS complex architecture to ensure optimal RIG-I signaling and highlights the broader regulatory role of UFMylation in antiviral innate immunity.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we examined how persistent PARylation influences cellular responses to replication stress and DNA damage. We found that during replication stress, the decline of ATR checkpoint activity marks the transition from fork stalling to fork collapse, a context in which stabilized poly(ADP-ribose) reduces chromatin-bound RPA. This loss of RPA, a key activator of the checkpoint, further reduces ATR signaling, revealing a feedback loop between unrestrained PARylation and checkpoint control.

R.; Baskaran, J.; Brown, M.; Parker, C.; Drotos, P.; West, R.", "abstract": "Embryo implantation requires a tightly regulated pro-inflammatory environment shared between the primitive placenta and decidua. While immune balance supports successful implantation and placental invasion, disruptions in immune signaling during this period can impair implantation and lead to embryo loss. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying immune imbalance during implantation using a trophoblast stem cell (TSC) model. TSCs were cultured in either stem cell or syncytiotrophoblast (STB) differentiation medium and treated with either lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or interferon beta (IFNB). RT-qPCR and Western blotting revealed that LPS failed to induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine response in TSCs or STBs. In contrast, IFNB triggered a strong antiviral response in both TSCs and STBs. RNA-sequencing of IFNB-treated TSC and STB 3D spheroids revealed subtle differences between the TSCs and STB responses to interferons. Both TSC and STB IFNB-treated spheroids mount an interferon-mediated antiviral response; however, STB spheroid genes associated with chemokines and cytokine production and immune cell migration are upregulated. We also compared the interferon response between the CT27 (female) and CT29 (male) TSCs and STBs. While STBs showed minimal differences, the CT29 TSCs exhibited a markedly stronger interferon response than the CT27 TSCs. Collectively, these findings suggest that the peri-implantation stage placenta is selectively responsive to interferon signaling rather than direct pathogen-associated stimuli. This implies that maternal immune activation, rather than microbial invasion, likely drives that placental immune response and embryo success at this stage. Understanding these dynamics underscores the importance of the maternal immune balance in early pregnancy success.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

This study aimed to synthesize T-map perfusion maps from routinely available, non-contrast DWI and FLAIR sequences by means of deep generative models. We hypothesized that relevant perfusion information could be inferred from these modalities that would streamline imaging and reduce reliance on dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion. Methods: Acute MRI data from 355 patients with anterior circulation stroke, including dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion, were retrospectively collected from two European centers. Six versions of a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and a GAN architecture were trained to generate synthetic T-max perfusion maps from DWI and FLAIR imaging and infarct core mask as input. Performance was assessed by comparing synthetic and ground truth T-max perfusion maps using image similarity metrics. Regions with T-max >6s were compared using Dice coefficients, and mismatch volume distributions were analyzed. An ablation study quantified the contribution of each input. Results: The best performance was achieved by a DDPM with a 2.5D architecture using DWI, FLAIR, infarct core mask, and a specified loss function. It produced synthetic perfusion T-max maps with high similarity to ground truth in an inference time of under 110 seconds. The model showed strong spatial overlap for clinically relevant T-max >6s regions in internal validation (average Dice = 0.82, SD = 0.08), and external validation average (Dice 0.59, SD = 0.13), respectively. Synthetic maps also closely matched ground-truth mismatch distributions, capturing key perfusion patterns. The infarct core mask played a critical role in model performance, alongside DWI and FLAIR inputs. Conclusions: We propose a robust, non-invasive, and scalable framework to generate synthetic T-max perfusion maps from standard non-contrast MRI.

AF1 localizes to the non-conserved and disordered N terminal domain and is believed to facilitate tissue- and gene-specific activity. Our previous proteomic analysis identified three key functional residues (K464, K481 and R492) of AF1 that are monomethylated. Mutations of KKR to phenylalanine (FFF) that mimic methylation created hypoactive PR, whereas KKR/QQQ mutations generated hyperactive PR in gene reporter assays. The current study investigated specific involvement of AF1 in PR regulation of gene expression in breast cancer cells. AF1-FFF mutations attenuated progestin induced growth regulation, cell adhesion and apoptosis and AF1-QQQ mutation enhanced these effects. Genome-wide expression analysis showed attenuated gene regulation by AF1-FFF of two thirds of PR target genes including genes involved in hypoxia and TNF signalling via NFKB. Unexpectedly, AF1-FFF mutations had little effect on ligand-independent gene regulation, suggesting distinct mechanisms of gene regulation by liganded and unliganded PR. Intriguingly, impaired activity of methylation mimic mutant PR-FFF is associated with higher enhancer binding peaks in ChIP-Seq analysis. This corresponds to a stronger association of AF1-FFF with SRC-1 and AF2 as we previously reported. We propose that methylation mimic AF1 mutant impairs regulation of a subset of genes through tighter coregulator binding which restricts the dynamics of the disassembly of transcription complex.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that most ATG genes were likely duplicated by whole-genome duplication events near the root of vertebrates. We compared the sequence and gene expression divergence between paralogs and categorized the evolutionary fates (i.e., how ancestral function is divided between paralogs). Within the paralog pairs that evolved most asymmetrically, namely BECN, WIPI (WIPI1 and WIPI2), and ATG16, one paralog likely retained the ancestral function, allowing the other to evolve under less constraint. While no obvious asymmetry was observed between ATG9A and ATG9B in non-mammalian vertebrates, ATG9B experienced marked sequence divergence and expression level reduction in mammals, suggesting a shift in balance. Expression patterns among the ULK-1 (ULK1 and ULK2), GABARAP (GABARAP and GABARAPL1), and LC3 (LC3A and LC3B) pairs were more consistent with hypofunctionalization/dosage sharing, such that ancestral function depends on both paralogs.

Biomimetic hydrogel scaffolds can be produced at scale through photopolymerization, which yet uses focused optics to define micrometer-resolved geometries, constraining scalability. To address the technical challenge of truly scalable biomimetic substrates featuring anisotropies, this study presents LigHTS, an all-optical, in-well method that replaces focused with collimated illumination to photofabricate structured hydrogels in standard 384/1536-well plates. Adding food dye tartrazine to gelatin-methacrylate (GelMA) solutions increases hydrogel thickness sensitivity to UV dose by ~10x, allowing uniform control of film thickness without lenses. Entire plates are functionalized in parallel with soft hydrogels (~1-10 kPa) whose thickness is tunable from 10 to 100 m. Simultaneously, simply interposing film photomasks encoding anisotropies enables orthogonal control of thickness and topography at UHTS throughput. Biological effect is demonstrated with mechanosensitive HT1080 cells, which display stiffness- and topography-dependent spreading and contact-guided migration on LigHTS-produced grooved substrates.

According to the mass-action law, this process can be described by a system of four ordinary differential equations for the four unknown concentrations, governed by the microscopic rate constants: forward (k_f), reverse (k_r), and catalytic (k_cat). Under suitable assumptions, the full system reduces to the classical Michaelis-Menten model, depending on two experimentally measurable parameters: the half saturation constant K_m, and the limiting rate V_max. This paper addresses the inverse problem of recovering k_f and k_r from K_m and V_max (or equivalently k_cat, retrievable from V_max). The proposed method exploits a new identity satisfied by any substrate concentration s(t) in the full mass-action system, which provides the starting point for the inversion procedure.

Here, to fill this gap we focus on model systems made of oligonucleotides with tuned lengths and degree of hybridization, mixed with a moderately charged, disordered peptide. Combining multiple length scales through experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, we unravel the distinct effect of the properties of NAs on the phase behavior and we propose a metric for the stability of biocondensates. We also characterize the conditions for the onset of liquid crystalline order in the droplets and we show that it is associated with a dramatic slowing down of the dynamics of oligonucleotides, while peptides retain high mobility. Our results can be generalized to natural and non-natural NAs of arbitrary structure, providing a guide for the design of synthetic NA-containing coacervates.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

A shortage of appropriate preclinical mouse models reflecting different pathophysiological disease aspects might contribute to this inadequate understanding of the complex and diverse HFpEF pathophysiology. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of a non-genetic, inducible T2DM mouse model with regard to its suitability as a preclinical model of cardiometabolic, diabetes-induced HFpEF. Methods: T2DM was induced in C57Bl/6 mice by high-fat/high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) combined with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) treatment (DIO-STZ), control animals received standard chow (chow). As additional control groups, animals of a DIO group were solely fed HFHSD throughout the study, and a STZ group received solely STZ injections while maintained on a standard chow. Cardiac function was assessed in vivo by echocardiography and left ventricular catheterization, as well as in vitro using the isolated perfused heart model. Structural, molecular and bioenergetic disturbances were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, RNA-seq, qPCR, western blot, and extracellular flux analysis of myocardial tissue, among others. Results: Blood glucose, fatty acids and ketone body levels were elevated, and insulin plasma level were reduced in DIO-STZ animals compared to chow. DIO-STZ mice showed a strong cardiometabolic HFpEF phenotype with reduced cardiac output, end-diastolic volume, and increased filling pressure. Neither STZ nor DIO mice showed signs of HFpEF development. No difference in myocardial fibrosis nor in in vitro myocardial stiffness was detected between DIO-STZ and chow. Myocardial RNA-Seq clearly pointed towards disturbances in lipid and ketone metabolism. Extracellular flux analysis in intact cardiac tissue slices revealed an increased fatty acid oxidation capacity without differences in glucose metabolism. Mitochondrial respirometry revealed no indication of general mitochondrial dysfunction or mitochondrial uncoupling, but a reduced capacity for {beta}-hydroxybutyrate oxidation. Conclusions: The diabetic DIO-STZ mouse model showed a pronounced functional HFpEF phenotype. However, we show clear evidence that the underlying mechanism differs remarkably from the other HFpEF models making the DIO-STZ model a relevant extension of the range of HFpEF mouse models, especially for investigating molecular mechanisms or therapeutical interventions in diabetes associated HFpEF.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

To assess variation of circadian rhythms in natural Arabidopsis populations, we have phenotyped 287 accessions using a seedling transformation protocol with a circadian luciferase reporter. A genome wide association study of circadian period identified multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the core clock gene EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3). We identified three haplogroups of ELF3 that are associated with seasonal variability in temperature found in continental climates and find strong evidence of a selective sweep coinciding with the most recent de-glaciation period in Europe.

Participants viewed a series of static and video stimuli produced either by human designers or artificial intelligence systems. Gaze behavior (fixation count, duration, and saccade length), emotional reliability (k-coefficient from RealEye facial-coding), and attitudinal evaluations were analyzed through both parametric and nonparametric statistical tests. The results reveal that human-made visuals elicited longer viewing durations (M = 7035 ms), higher fixation counts (M = 1.44), and broader spatial exploration, suggesting richer semantic and aesthetic engagement. In contrast, AI-generated images produced shorter but more focused attention patterns (M = 4945 ms) and higher but less stable emotional reactions (k = 0.16). The correlation between fixation metrics and affective responses was non-significant ({rho} = -0.015), indicating that cognitive attention and emotional resonance operate as distinct dimensions. Attitudinal data showed a 68.4% accuracy in attributing authorship, with AI visuals often misclassified as human-made reflection of perceptual authenticity bias.

Here, to clarify the mechanical links between cell adhesion, protrusions, and migration, we analyzed glioblastoma-derived cells migrating on fibronectin- and laminin-coated extracellular matrix (ECM) substrates using time-lapse imaging and mathematical modeling. We quantified cell motility on each ECM and constructed a coarse-grained biophysical model that incorporates catch- and slip-bond kinetics. We treated the ECM as an external boundary condition that modulates adhesion dynamics, distinct from the intrinsic mechanical parameters of the cell. The model reproduced ECM-dependent differences in cell motility. The results suggest that adhesions and protrusion elongation on fibronectin are less stable than on laminin, and opposing forces between protrusions reduce net displacement more strongly on fibronectin than on laminin, leading to less coordinated tensile forces. Based on these results, we establish mechanical polarity, defined as an imbalance of protrusion- and adhesion-mediated forces that drive directional migration, as a quantifiable physical principle of cell protrusion and migration. This principle likely extends beyond glioblastoma biology, providing a generalizable mechanism that links adhesion dynamics to migration stability and offering a physical basis for strategies to suppress invasive cell behavior.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

In non-human primates, invasive electrophysiology has shown that attentional selection operates rhythmically, primarily within the alpha (~8-12 Hz) and theta (~4-5 Hz) bands. Whether such finely resolved control signals can be captured non-invasively in humans, and how they adapt to changing task demands, remains unclear. Using high-precision magnetoencephalography (MEG) combined with machine learning, we decoded the spatial locus of covert attention in humans performing three variants of a spatial cueing task that manipulated cue validity as well invalid trial switching rules. Spatial attention could be decoded from whole-brain MEG activity at both static and time-resolved scales, with accuracies significantly above chance (N = 30). Decoding performance decreased as cue validity was reduced, indicating that task structure shapes attentional engagement. Analysis of decoding trajectories revealed rhythmic fluctuations at ~8-12 Hz across all tasks, demonstrating alpha-band sampling of attention. Pre-target attention became increasingly focused on the cued side, especially in the 100% Valid condition, consistent with proactive orienting. Furthermore, individual and task-specific differences in decoding strength correlated with task-variations in behavioral performance, linking the accuracy of neural attention codes to both discrimination accuracy and reaction time. These findings demonstrate that MEG can non-invasively capture dynamic, task-dependent fluctuations in spatial attention that parallel those observed in non-human primates. They reveal that attentional demands reshape the neural code for attention, modulate rhythmic sampling, and influence behavioral efficiency. This work bridges invasive primate and non-invasive human research and establishes MEG-based decoding of attention as a promising tool for mechanistic and clinical applications, including neurofeedback and attention-related interventions.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

LC neurons are the earliest site of hyper-phosphorylated tau accumulation, leading to a decline in nucleus structural integrity in older age that likely impacts long-term memory. While several studies have explored the link between pupil dilation and successful memory encoding, little is known about the effects of aging on this relationship. This study investigated task-evoked pupillary responses (TEPRs) in young and older adults during incidental encoding of neutral visual scenes. Memory performance was assessed 24 hours later using a Remember-Know-Guess recognition task. TEPRs were compared based on recognition performance. Our findings notably revealed attenuated TEPRs in older individuals, supporting the hypothesis of impaired LC-driven modulation with age. Pupil dilation was associated with memory performance in young adults only. In this group, subsequently recognized stimuli elicited greater dilation during encoding compared to forgotten ones. Moreover, among recognized stimuli, recollected ones evoked larger pupillary responses than those remembered with a feeling of familiarity. Importantly, this effect was absent in older adults, suggesting that the benefit provided by LC involvement during encoding declines with advancing age. These findings highlight the crucial role of LC-mediated neuromodulation in episodic memory, and suggest that age-related LC decline can be evidenced using pupillometry.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Traditional disease models suggest that defective repression of thioester protein C3 activity by complement factor H (CFH) is a major contributor to pathogenesis in AMD and a related disease, early-onset drusen maculopathy (EODM). Our previous study identified novel functions for human CFH and C. elegans CFH-1 in the maintenance of inversin compartment integrity in photoreceptors and mechanosensory neurons, indicating that CFH has a novel, evolutionarily conserved role in cilia compartment organization that is distinct from its established function in alternative complement pathway regulation. Here, we investigate the C. elegans thioester protein TEP-1, an ancestral relative of C3 and other members of the AMCOM family (C4, C5, CD109, and alpha-2-macroglobulin). TEP-1 localizes to select glial cell surfaces and regulates inversin compartment organization and intraflagellar transport (IFT) within the cilia of ensheathed sensory neurons. In addition to revealing a novel role for an AMCOM family member in sensory neuron structure and protein transport, the localization of C3 and CFH on human photoreceptors provides support for non-canonical models of AMD and EODM pathogenesis in which defects in cilia structure and protein transport contribute directly to the progressive photoreceptor dysfunction that characterizes these diseases.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

In geckos, chemical cues are secreted by follicular glands, which vary widely in number across species.

We detected partial phylogenetic conservatism, but ecological factors explained substantial additional variation within the trait. Substrate use exerted the strongest direct effect: terrestrial species consistently had fewer glands than arboreal or rupicolus species, likely reflecting differences in signal persistence across habitats. Climatic factors predominantly exerted an indirect effect, by influencing substrate availability and modulating its influence. Arid conditions selected for reduced chemical investment, whereas mesic, structurally complex forests favoured elevated gland numbers, likely to compensate for faster chemical degradation. These results demonstrate that chemical signalling in geckos likely evolves under a nested hierarchy of constraints, with climate setting broad ecological limits and substrate imposing the strongest immediate selection.

Network theory has helped our understanding of how ecological interactions shape island biogeography dynamics, using empirical and theoretical studies to explore species-rich island community structures. Mutualistic networks on islands differ from those on the mainland by supporting fewer species and more super-generalists, resulting in a more nested community structure. Coevolution, the reciprocal adaptation between interacting species, can shape traits and interactions within these networks, influencing their assembly. Here we explore how colonization, extinction, and coevolution can intersect to shape species traits and the structure of mutualistic networks. Using a stochastic dynamic model, we integrate Island Biogeography Theory with coevolutionary dynamics, examining pollination networks to understand trait-matching in evolving communities. Our results show that highly nested and connected mainland communities contribute to greater instability on islands, particularly under intermediate extinction rates. While super-generalist species persist longer, their persistence does not greatly exceed those species with fewer interactions beyond a threshold, which itself varies with the extinction rate. Additionally, coevolution leads to greater trait-similarity within communities on islands.

One current limitation to studying and applying exomeres for therapeutic RNA delivery is the shortage of scalable, cost-effective, and rapid isolation methods. Here, we investigated whether tangential flow filtration (TFF), a common bioseparation approach that separates species by size, would effectively isolate exomeres from conditioned media with comparable purity and identity to those isolated by differential ultracentrifugation. TFF successfully isolated exomeres that were enriched in RNAi components including AGO2, HSP90AB1, and a unique set of miRNAs not abundant in EVs. Remarkably, exomere miRNAs were resistant to nuclease degradation even after treatment with protease and surfactant, suggesting that exomeres are highly stable, non-vesicular complexes with potentially extended circulating half-lives. Together, our results establish TFF as an efficient method for isolating exomeres, and further demonstrate that TFF could be applied in a bioprocess for exomere-based RNA therapeutics production.

To tackle this, we developed OptimJV3, a modular framework that integrates multiple GA variants, including a multi-objective approach that also considers computational time. We evaluated OptimJV3 on various genomic datasets (FASTA format), namely Human Chromosome Y (CY), Cassava, and the full Human Genome (HG), and observed notable compression gains. For large sequences like Cassava and HG, we applied sampling-based optimization: optimal parameters were first identified from smaller segments and then used for full sequence compression. These small segments proved effective for guiding parameter tuning. Further improvements were achieved by increasing the number of GA generations, especially for HG. For example, using a 10 MB sample and 500 generations, OptimJV3 reached a compression rate of 1.431 bits per base on HG - among the best results reported so far.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

However, molecular profiling through RNA sequencing remains costly, time-consuming and complicated by intratumoral heterogeneity. We developed a Deep Learning (DL) approach to infer molecular subtypes from routine histopathological slides and to evaluate its prognostic value in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). We developed an DL-model predicting the expression of 848 subtype-associated genes from histological images of transurethral resection of bladder tumor, enabling spatial molecular subtyping at tile level. The model was trained on 297 NAC-treated patients from the VESPER clinical trial and evaluated on three independent cohorts (COBLAnCE, n=224; Saint-Louis, n=30 and TCGA, n=315), covering diverse staining protocols and scanner types. Spatial transcriptomics from six VESPER patients confirmed the spatial consistency of the inferred expression profiles. Our approach achieved a ROC AUC of 0.94 for molecular subtype prediction, with 95% of genes significantly predicted, demonstrating its ability to capture transcriptomic dysregulations from histological morphology. Predicted expression maps revealed spatially coherent patterns and intratumoral molecular heterogeneity. Importantly, tumors predicted with basal/squamous features (pure or mixed), were associated with significantly worse progression-free and overall survival after NAC (log-rank p=0.014 and 0.037, respectively). This DL-based framework enables accurate and spatially resolved inference of gene expression and molecular subtypes in MIBC without sequencing. These findings could improve patient stratification in clinical practice and support the design of more targeted clinical trials. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed before routine clinical implementation.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate whether caffeine ingestion offsets the circadian-related decline in morning neuromuscular performance in females. Methods: Thirteen healthy females completed three experimental trials: i) evening placebo (PMPLAC), ii) morning placebo (AMPLAC), and iii) morning caffeine ingestion (6 mg{middle dot}kg-1; AMCAFF). A within-subject, repeated-measures, crossover, single-blind placebo design was used, with all subjects serving as their own controls. Each trial consisted of a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the knee extensors, followed by intermittent isometric contractions (6 s contraction, 4 s rest) until task failure, and a post-fatigue MVIC. Time to exhaustion, torque and peak force, surface electromyography (RMS amplitude, MDF frequency), rate of perceived exertion, and tympanic temperature were all recorded across conditions. Results: During PMPLAC, peak force and time to exhaustion were significantly greater (p < 0.05) than for AMPLAC. AMCAFF increased (p < 0.01) peak force in both pre- (+33%) and post- (+45%) fatigue MVIC trials compared to PMPLAC. Similarly, RMS was increased (p < 0.01) during both AMCAFF and PMPLAC compared to AMPLAC, whereas MDF did not change (p > 0.05) across trials. AMCAFF also improved (p < 0.01) time to exhaustion by 43% compared to AMPLAC, and significantly reduced (p < 0.01) rate of perceived exertion, but without any change (p > 0.05) in temperature. Conclusions: Morning ingestion of 6 mg{middle dot}kg-1 of caffeine effectively reverses diurnal reductions in neuromuscular performance of females by restoring peak force and time to exhaustion to evening levels. No change in MDF, but an increased RMS suggests a central rather than peripheral mechanism for caffeines ergogenic effects.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Across a six-session creative art-making program, we tracked cardiac synchrony (CS) within 31 intergenerational (older/younger adult) and 30 same generation (younger adult) dyads. Each session dyads completed self-report measures, then drew together and alone, while we recorded participants' actions with motion capture and their physiological signals (neural and cardiac) using fNIRS. Collaborative behaviour, self-reported social closeness, and interpersonal distance (i.e., proximity) showed group-specific patterns, whereby interpersonal distance emerged as a promising objective measure of relationship development. CS did not covary with group, task, an interaction thereof or any measure of behaviour or social closeness, yet there was a trending relationship between collaboration while drawing together and CS for intergenerational dyads only.

This study investigates the efficacy of a specific type of hetero-chitooligosaccharide called DACOS, as a plant defense inducer against the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch. DACOS is characterized with 85% deacetylation and an average molecular weight of 1 kDa. In planta bioassays revealed a dose-dependent suppression of mite performance on DACOS-treated leaves of kidney bean seedlings, with peak efficacy occurring at 80 ppm. This concentration reduced mite survival by 30% and fecundity by 59% after six days. In addition to the local effects, mite survival and fecundity were also reduced on untreated leaves of the same seedlings, confirming that the effect of DACOS on plant defense is systemic. Behavioral choice assays revealed that DACOS-treated leaves induced 73% mite repellency. No direct acaricidal effects were observed, which confirms the role of DACOS as a plant defense elicitor. Metabolic profiling revealed enriched pathways (e.g., monoterpenoid biosynthesis and -linolenic acid metabolism) that produce volatile organic compounds with repellent properties. These findings suggest that DACOS is an environmentally friendly biostimulant that can enhance plant defense, bypass pesticide resistance, and promote the sustainability of crop production.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

A.; Mentor, W.; Birk, A.", "abstract": "Purpose: Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss in glaucoma occurs in a large fraction of patients even after intraocular pressure (IOP) is reduced. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a key mechanism that links elevated IOP to RGC degeneration. We tested whether HDAP2, a novel high-density aromatic peptide that binds cardiolipin to stabilize mitochondrial membranes, can protect RGCs in the DBA/2J mouse model. Methods: DBA/2J mice received HDAP2 (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, every other day) starting at 4 months of age for 8 months. IOP was measured each month to track pressure exposure. RGC survival was assessed by counting RBPMS-stained cells in retinal wholemounts and optic nerve axons in semithin toludine blue-stained sections. Results: HDAP2-treated retinas had about 49% more RGCs than untreated retinas at similar pressure exposures (p = 0.0063; F(2,59) = 5.524). At mild IOP exposure, HDAP2 preserved 58% more RGCs compared with untreated retinas, and at high IOPs, RGC survival was 180% greater. Kaplan Meier analysis indicated that HDAP2 increased the threshold for severe RGC loss by 29 mmHg and reduced the chance of developing severe RGC degeneration by a factor of 4.6. Optic nerve axons from treated retinas were also well preserved, with axon morphologies appearing indistinguishable from controls. Axon size distributions did not change significantly among the treatment groups, suggesting that protection by HDAP2 was similar among RGC subtypes. Conclusions: HDAP2 preserved both RGCs and axons in a pressure-dependent manner and increased tolerance to IOP. These results suggest that HDAP2 may complement pressure-lowering therapy, including for normal-tension and treatment-refractory glaucoma.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Overcoming such limits requires novel training paradigms that can engage performers in novel ways of exploring and refining their actions. Here, we introduce a training pipeline that integrates high-precision motion sensing with augmented feedback to enhance expert-level motor learning. Using piano performance as a model, trained pianists practiced imitating a prize-winning expert's performance of a technically demanding movement sequence. While conventional auditory-based learning offered limited benefit, augmenting practice with trial-by-trial visualizations of discrepancies between the pianist's own movements and those of the expert enabled learners to refine their performance. This training induced richer movement exploration, facilitated closer convergence toward expert motion patterns, and produced perceptible improvements in sound quality evaluated by professional pianists. These findings demonstrate that augmented feedback can break performance plateaus in experts by providing externally-sensed, task-specific information that expands exploration beyond habitual training strategies. Such augmented learning promises new applications across domains where expertise is constrained by entrenched motor habits, including musical performance, athletics, and surgical training.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

In Xenopus laevis, males generate fast trills composed of clicks repeated at 60 Hz, a feature absent in both Silurana tropicalis males and X. laevis females, whose calls consist of slower click rates (30 Hz and 7 Hz, respectively). In male X. laevis, fast trills are generated by premotor neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN), known as Fast Trill Neurons (FTNs). We hypothesized that FTNs are unique in male X. laevis, and either absent or molecularly distinct in clawed frogs that do not produce fast trills. To test this, we used constellation pharmacology to profile receptor expression of neurons via intracellular Ca2+; responses to pharmacological agents in PBN neurons from male X. laevis, male S. tropicalis, and female X. laevis. Surprisingly, we found putative FTNs in all three groups, including those that do not produce fast trills. Furthermore, a similar proportion of FTNs across groups expressed fast-kinetic voltage-gated potassium channels known to support rapid firing, indicating that the presence of these channels does not correlate with the ability to produce fast trills. Instead, some of these channels were more prevalent in males of both species compared to female X. laevis, suggesting a potential sex-specific, non-vocal function. The discovery of FTNs with similar molecular profiles in non-fast-trilling individuals suggests that these neurons are conserved across species and sexes, and may serve other functions. In male X. laevis, FTNs may have been repurposed for fast trill production during speciation. These findings provide new insight into understanding how neural circuits evolve and diversify across species and sexes.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

G. omarorum is a teleost fish in which neuroestrogens have been shown to play a key role in non-breeding aggression. Here, we quantified circulating hormone levels and gene expression in the social behavior network of wild breeding and non-breeding individuals. During the non-breeding season, both sexes exhibited elevated circulating androgen levels, providing potential substrates for local estrogen synthesis. Consistently, brain aromatase and estrogen receptor expression were also upregulated, suggesting an increased capacity for local estrogen synthesis and signaling.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, transcription start site (TSS) selection proceeds by a promoter scanning mechanism where the PIC scans downstream for TSSs. To determine what factors participate in TSS selection by promoter scanning we designed and implemented forward genetic selections using initiation-sensitive genetic reporters. These reporters were of two types, either being sensitive to upstream or downstream TSS shifts, allowing us to detect alleles that affect promoter scanning in different directions. From >1000 candidates, we identified three primary classes of mutants: existing and novel mutants within known PIC components, including novel alleles of multiple TFIIH subunits; mutants that alter promoter scanning indirectly through cellular conditions (GTP levels and Mn2+ levels); and mutants in chromatin and transcription elongation related factors. Genome-wide analysis using TSS mapping shows that tested PIC mutants alter TSS usage globally across promoters while tested chromatin and transcription elongation mutants had much more limited affects. These studies expand the spectrum of mutants able to perturb initiation by promoter scanning and suggest potential plasticity in the TFIIH structure that may be part of the evolution of this initiation mechanism.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

L.; Potus, F.", "abstract": "Abstract: Aims: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) due to left heart disease (Group-2PH) is the most common form of PH and comprises two distinct subtypes: isolated post-capillary-PH (IpcPH) and combined post- and pre-capillary-PH (CpcPH). Despite its high prevalence and poor prognosis, no targeted therapies are currently approved, largely due to the absence of reliable preclinical models that recapitulate these human hemodynamic phenotypes. Levosimendan, a calcium sensitizer with inotropic and vasodilatory properties, has shown promise in early clinical trials for Group-2PH, but its mechanisms of action remain unclear. This study aimed to develop and validate experimental models of IpcPH and CpcPH and to assess the therapeutic effects of levosimendan on pulmonary vascular remodeling, inflammation, and cardiac function to support ongoing clinical translation. Methods and Results: In a multicentre preclinical study, we established two rodent models that faithfully replicate the human IpcPH and CpcPH hemodynamic profiles. CpcPH animals exhibited severe pulmonary vascular remodeling, inflammatory cell infiltration, and a distinct pro-proliferative transcriptomic signature, whereas IpcPH animals showed minimal pulmonary vascular involvement. Levosimendan (3 mg/kg/day, 3 weeks) improved biventricular function and pulmonary hemodynamics in both models. In CpcPH, levosimendan additionally reduced pulmonary vascular remodeling, attenuated inflammation, and partially reversed disease-associated transcriptomic reprogramming. Transcription factor enrichment analysis identified NF-{kappa}B as a key upstream regulator inhibited by treatment. In a translational extension, nine circulating inflammation-related-proteins differentiated CpcPH from IpcPH patients; among them, TNF, IL-12B, 4E-BP1, NT-3, NGF, FGF21, and FGF23 predicted poor survival. IL-18 and 4E-BP1 were elevated in CpcPH lungs and decreased following levosimendan treatment. Conclusions: Inflammation is a major contributor to adverse pulmonary vascular remodeling in CpcPH. Levosimendan improves cardiac performance and mitigates pulmonary vascular inflammation and remodeling, supporting its potential as a dual-action therapeutic agent in Group-2PH. These findings validate novel preclinical models and provide mechanistic evidence reinforcing ongoing clinical evaluation of levosimendan in this condition.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Although both subunits contribute to chromatin organization, their specific functions in de novo loop formation during post-mitotic genome refolding remain elusive. Here, we leverage the mitosis-to-G1 transition to dissect their individual roles. We found that Stag1 depletion has a negligible impact on post-mitotic genome restructuring or transcription reactivation. In contrast, Stag2 orchestrates chromatin remodeling in a manner that is both cell cycle stage-specific and chromatin context-dependent. During early-G1, Stag2 preferentially associates with euchromatin, where it drives the rapid formation of small chromatin loops. This facilitates prompt promoter-enhancer (P-E) contact formation and enables efficient transcription activation. As the nuclear concentration of Stag2 increases by late-G1, it progressively suppresses large loops, likely due to its shorter chromatin residence time and its potential to competitively displace the more extrusion-capable Stag1-associated cohesin. Mechanistically, Stag2-mediated loop extrusion is constrained by CTCF-bound barriers, rather than by genomic travel distance. Although Stag2 associates rapidly with euchromatin in early-G1, its recruitment to heterochromatin is delayed until late-G1. Simultaneous depletion of both Stag proteins results in a synergistic loss of virtually all structural loops and a more severe disruption of transcription than that caused by individual deletions. Together, these results establish Stag2 as the principal regulator of post-mitotic genome reorganization among Stag paralogs, mediating spatiotemporal control of chromatin architecture, while Stag1 provides compensatory support to ensure functional robustness.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Rodent models have been invaluable for elucidating AKI mechanisms; however, most studies have focused on males, assuming direct applicability to females, an assumption that remains largely untested. In males, the transcription factor SOX9 regulates injury-associated proximal tubule cell states, supporting survival during injury but also contributing to maladaptive repair. Given the well-described role of SOX9 in sex determination during development and its emerging importance in AKI, we investigated whether it mediates sex-specific tubular responses in the adult kidney. Methods: We first optimized differential ischemic and cisplatin conditions in males and females to generate injury-matched models. We then used these models to ask whether proximal tubular cell responses, particularly Sox9 upregulation, are sex dependent. Tubule-specific knockout models of Sox9, Sox4, Sox11, Vgf, Zfp24, and the androgen receptor (Ar), along with gonadectomy and hormone replacement studies, combined with gene and protein analyses, were used to define regulatory networks. Results: In both ischemic and nephrotoxic AKI, SOX9 expression was markedly blunted in females, with levels more than fivefold lower than in males. While injury biomarkers such as NGAL and KIM1 were equally induced in both sexes, Sox9 and its downstream target Vgf showed markedly reduced induction in females, whereas the upstream regulator Zfp24 was functionally relevant only in males. Deletion of Sox9, Zfp24, or Vgf worsened injury in males but not in females. In contrast, Sox4 and Sox11 were equally upregulated and protective in both sexes. Castration or proximal tubule-specific deletion of Ar in males abolished Sox9 induction, establishing a testosterone-dependent regulatory axis. Conclusions: These findings define a hormone-driven, male-specific tubular repair program and demonstrate that injury and recovery pathways differ fundamentally between sexes, underscoring the need for sex-inclusive therapeutic strategies for AKI.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

To determine the effect of hERG1NP variants on hERG1NP activity, we measured hERG1NP intracellular localization and modulation of membrane current from the full-length hERG1a channel in HEK293 cells. The wildtype hERG1NP suppressed both hERG1a current (IhERG) and protein. We then screened six hERG1NP variants for changes in either intracellular targeting or modulation of hERG1a current. Two variants, R885C and R1047L, disrupted hERG1NP activity by altering nuclear transport or abolishing both IhERG current suppression and nuclear targeting, respectively. Two additional variants, G1036D and Q1068R, enhanced hERG1NP activity by depolarizing the voltage dependence of hERG1a activation via accelerated channel deactivation and recovery from inactivation. Lastly, two variants had no effect: R1035W and R1069S.

To test the Lagrangian nature of these experiments, we adapted the Bindoff and McDougall (1994) approach for decomposing observed changes between adjacent CTD profiles into components due to vertical movement (heaving) and those occurring along isopycnal surfaces. Profile depth variability was mainly driven by vertical displacements of isopycnals (internal waves), while temperature, chlorophyll, oxygen and salinity were relatively stable when observed on isopycnal surfaces across all casts within the same cycle, and different on average between cycles. Our analysis clearly indicated that density surface was a more appropriate vertical coordinate than physical depth for assessing real environmental variability during each cycle and confirmed the Lagrangian character of the experiments.

However, some species undergo programmed DNA elimination (PDE), whereby specific genome regions are removed from somatic cell lineages early during development, leading to distinct germline and somatic genomes. Since its discovery in parasitic nematodes over a century ago, PDE has been observed in diverse eukaryotes, including ciliates, arthropods, and vertebrates. However, the function, mechanisms, and evolutionary origins of PDE remain poorly understood. Here, we report the unexpected discovery of PDE in three early-diverging Caenorhabditis species. Using long-read and chromatin conformation capture sequencing, we reconstructed germline and somatic genomes for all three species, and found that between 0.7 and 2.3% of the genome is eliminated during the 8- to 16-cell stage of embryogenesis, including the telomeres and regions within chromosomes. Elimination of regions within chromosomes results in fragmentation of the six germline chromosomes into 8-15 somatic chromosomes. The sites of elimination are precise, and we identified conserved motifs that likely recruit a nuclease to induce double-strand breaks. The newly formed somatic chromosome ends are healed by de novo telomere addition. A small number of genes are eliminated in each species, some of which have C. elegans orthologues with essential germline functions. A subset of elimination sites are orthologous across species, and some coincide with genome rearrangement sites. The phylogenetic distribution of PDE suggests that it was present in the last common Caenorhabditis ancestor and subsequently lost early during the evolution of many species, including C. elegans.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Subgenome assignment revealed an octoploid AABBBBCC structure with three ancestral lineages (A, B, C), and an aneuploid composition of 14A, 22B, and 12C chromosomes. Comparative analyses with related Urochloa species identified U. dictyoneura and U. arrecta as potential progenitors of the B and C subgenomes, respectively. The likely progenitor of the A subgenome remains an unknown wild species from the Humidicola clade. Analysis of LTR-retrotransposons and gene collinearity further indicated a close relationship between A and B ancestries, and a distinct evolutionary path for C. Competitive read mapping across additional U. humidicola accessions supported multiple evolutionary histories in the species, with AABBBB (lacking C ancestry), being the most common. We found that previously described subpopulation structures can be explained by the presence or absence of C ancestry, and that sexual U. humidicola are likely to be autopolyploid from the B ancestry. The genome is available as assembly GCA_965614515.2. This assembly provides the first complete reference for U. humidicola and reveals a multi-ancestral origin and reticulated evolution in U. humidicola. It provides a foundation for studying complex polyploid evolution, regulation of apomixis and biological nitrification inhibition, and molecular breeding strategies.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Conventional genetic engineering of hiPSC lines requires a laborious process involving transfection, selection and expansion that can result in karyotypic abnormalities or transgene silencing during differentiation, limiting their applications. Self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) delivery is a potential alternative integration-free method for durable expression of transgenes. Here, we used saRNA to deliver transcription factors and functional reporters in hiPSCs and demonstrate that expression can persist for weeks. Specifically, saRNA delivery enables highly efficient forward programming to Ngn2-induced neurons and enables measurement of functional reporters over time. We show that a single transfection of saRNA encoded jRCaMP1b reporter in hiPSCs generates sustained expression throughout differentiation to 3D cardiac spheroids. The persistence of the reporter allows measurement of calcium dynamics at a single-cell and population level over weeks, allowing tracking of cardiomyocyte maturation and drug responses. Together, our systematic analysis shows that saRNA provides sustained transgene expression in hiPSCs, supporting integration- free cell-fate programming and measurement of functional reporters in clinically relevant model systems.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Matrix vesicles, a matrix-bound subset of EVs, are essential mediators of endochondral ossification in bone development and fracture repair. This study aims to design bioengineered matrix vesicles from hypertrophic cartilage microtissues to drive endochondral ossification for bone repair. Human mesenchymal stromal cell (hBMSC) microtissues were differentiated with/without BMP2 in chondrogenic or hypertrophic medium. Isolated matrix vesicles were characterized for physiochemical properties and biological functionality. BMP2 and hypertrophic conditioning significantly increased vesicle yield (1.5-fold), alkaline phosphatase activity (3.24-fold), calcium binding capacity (8.82-fold), and growth factor content (BMP2, VEGF). These vesicles promoted proliferation, migration, and mineralization of hBMSCs and enhanced angiogenesis in human endothelial colony forming cells (hECFCs), with BMP2 and hypertrophically conditioned vesicles showing the most pronounced effects. Proteomics analysis confirmed the enrichment of proteins involved in extracellular matrix remodelling, mineral deposition and vascularization within these hypertrophically engineered vesicles. These findings demonstrate that hypertrophic induction of cartilaginous microtissues substantially improves the yield and therapeutic potential of matrix vesicles.

Despite significant advances in static structure prediction, accurately modeling these multiple conformations remains a major challenge. Here, we present M-DeepAssembly2, a web server designed for modeling multiple conformations of multi-domain proteins using deep learning-predicted inter-domain and intra-domain constraints. The server operates in three stages. Firstly, evolutionary, physicochemical, and geometric features are extracted from the input and fed into AlphaFlex, a flexible residue prediction network. This process generates multiple distance maps that effectively capture both inter-domain and intra-domain interactions. Secondly, supplementary distance maps that characterize inter-domain interactions are generated using the DeepAssembly method. Finally, all distance maps are integrated as constraints in a multi-objective protein optimization to generate multiple conformational states of the protein. Compared to its predecessor, M-DeepAssembly2 leverages a flexible residue prediction network that directionally decouples coevolutionary information to generate heterogeneous distance maps. Benchmark results demonstrate that this strategy enables accurate prediction of protein multiple conformations and significantly improves the precision of static multi-domain protein structure prediction.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

However, accumulating evidence suggests that differential adhesion is many times insufficient for robust convergence to a target minimal energy multicellular structure. Here we use computational simulations and engineered synthetic cell circuits to systematically explore alternative mechanisms for programming formation of a simple two-cell type core-shell morphology. Starting with two pre-differentiated cell types with constitutively high differential adhesion leads to kinetic trapping in variable, multi-core structures. In contrast, hybrid mechanisms that gradually induce differential adhesion upon cell-cell contact signaling consistently converge to the target single-core structure, in a manner robust to variation in cell numbers, interaction energy, and noise. This work delineates intrinsic limitations of self-organizing systems based solely on differential adhesion, and shows how inducible systems provide a way to invoke the strong adhesion required to maintain a multicellular structure, while avoiding the pitfall of kinetic traps.

Current laboratory methods for mycotoxin analysis are expensive and time-intensive, creating a need for faster, more accessible solutions. This study set out to address this challenge by developing a portable spectrometer prototype based on the near-infrared (NIR) region and designing a chemometric model to classify ground maize as either non-compliant (NC) or compliant (C) for zearalenone (ZON) and deoxynivalenol (DON). A total of 259 naturally contaminated maize samples, collected over two years from diverse European regions, were analyzed using both liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and the prototype device. Spectral data were preprocessed using the first derivative, and a partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model was developed to classify ZON and DON levels into NC and C categories. Thresholds of 100 {micro}g/kg for ZON and 500 {micro}g/kg for DON were used to define compliance. The PLS-DA model showed good performance for ZON, achieving a classification accuracy of 86.3%. However, for DON classification a rather limited accuracy of 66.75% was achieved. While the DON model could identify NC samples it struggled with C samples. Despite these challenges, the results highlight the potential of a portable NIR spectrometer, combined with straightforward preprocessing and PLS-DA modeling, as a rapid, cost-effective screening tool for detecting mycotoxins in maize.

We used the staple crop barley [Hordeum vulgare] as a model to benchmark different sampling approaches for simultaneous exudation and microbiota profiling of soil-grown plants. Exudate profiles and total dissolved organic carbon exudation rates were consistent across different sampling approaches, whereas root biomass, root morphology measurements, and organic nitrogen exudation varied. High-throughput amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR) of phylogenetic markers and nitrogen cycle-selected genes revealed a protocol-specific footprint in the composition and abundance of rhizosphere bacterial and fungal microbiota.

These neurons are mapped onto a quantitative anatomical model of the insula based on a Nissl-staining coordinate framework. Using improved algorithms, we define 21 morphological, 12 electrical, and 9 input neuronal types, and identify several morphological and input types that are unique to the insula. Further, we find that morphological properties constrain and often predict inputs, electrical properties, or projection targets. Several morphological types are differentially distributed between the functionally distinct anterior and posterior insula, providing the substrates for a quantitative demarcation between the anterior and posterior insular subregions. Surprisingly, certain neuronal types receive intra-insular inputs originating far beyond canonical cortical columns.

Here, we asked the question whether inter-retina crosstalk predicts the nature of neurovascular coupling in the brain.

We used three visual paradigms: a Threshold speed and Sub-maximum speed discrimination tasks, and flicker stimulation. The presence or absence of inter-retinal coupling was predictive of the time course of the cortical hemodynamic response, either during the initial or late phases. The presence of interocular coupling predicted larger BOLD responses. Diabetic patients with interocular coupling showed a very similar profile to the healthy group.

It results from both myopathic and neuropathic injury and is associated with heightened patient morbidity and mortality. Critical illness survivors exhibit variable functional outcomes following ICUAW, ranging from full recovery to persistent weakness with a significant negative impact on quality of life. Despite clinical importance, the mechanistic understanding of ICUAW remains incomplete, in part due to a paucity of tractable, species-specific experimental models. Previous studies have suggested a potential causative role of bloodborne factors, though this remains a matter of debate. To address these technological and knowledge gaps, we leveraged a 3-D human skeletal muscle microtissue (hMMT) culture platform to investigate the ability of humoral factors to directly impact pathogenesis of the myopathic component of ICUAW; critical illness myopathy (CIM). Blood serum collected from ICU patients within 72 hours of ICU admission was used to treat hMMTs for 6 days starting at a time-point when the myotubes were multinucleated, striated, and capable of generating force. hMMTs treated with serum from patients that survived the ICU stay exhibited several hallmarks of CIM including; significant reductions in myotube diameter (atrophy) and striation density, alongside functional declines in calcium release, peak force, and force kinetics. The in vitro profiles of ICU serum treated hMMTs displayed significant associations with known ICUAW and CIM clinical risk factors (e.g. age, length of ICU stay) such that individual patient risk factors could be predicted from serum-induced hMMT responses. An evaluation of hMMT responses enabled delineation of ICU non-survivors from healthy control and ICU survivors. This study offers an enabling technology for studies of CIM biology in the context of human cells while also delivering compelling evidence that humoral factors directly influence ICU-associated skeletal muscle pathogenesis.

Using DNA-based tension probes, we reveal 8-19 pN mechanical forces with sub-second timescales transmitted by CAR T cells to their target antigens. CAR-antigen force magnitude is independent of CAR expression level and shows heterogeneity across different T cell donors, suggesting utility as a biomarker of T cell fitness. Using an established exhaustion model, we show strong correlation between CAR exhaustion, cytotoxic capacity, and CAR-antigen force, suggesting that CAR mechanics provide a biomarker of CAR potency complementary to functional assays. Pharmacological inhibition studies demonstrate that CAR forces are driven by actin, Zap70 and Src family proximal kinases. Titration of dasatinib, a clinically used tyrosine kinase inhibitor, also dampens both CAR-antigen tension and CAR function in a dose-dependent manner.

Cardiac involvement is the major determinant of prognosis and mortality, and beyond fibril accumulation, soluble cardiotoxic LCs play a critical role in disease progression. While current in vivo models like C. elegans and murine systems have demonstrated LC toxicity, they lack human relevance or fail to capture soluble LC-induced cardiotoxicity. This study aimed to characterize the electrophysiological effects of cardiotoxic LCs on a human-relevant model using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Methods and Results Two amyloidogenic cardiotoxic LCs (H3 and H6) from AL patients and one non-cardiotoxic LC (M10) from a multiple myeloma patient were biophysically characterized and tested in hiPSC-CMs at clinically relevant concentrations. Electrophysiological recordings revealed that H3 and H6 significantly reduced spontaneous action potential (AP) firing frequency and maximal upstroke velocity (dV/dt) in hiPSC-CMs, indicating impaired excitability. H6 also shortened AP duration. H3 exposure led to a ~40% reduction in peak sodium current density and altered inactivation kinetics of the L-type calcium current, without affecting major pacemaker or repolarizing potassium (IKr or IKs) currents. In contrast, M10 had no effect on any measured parameter, validating the model's ability to discriminate toxic from non-toxic LCs. Conclusion This study demonstrates that hiPSC-CMs provide a clinically relevant human model to investigate LC-induced cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxic LCs exert distinct but converging electrophysiological impairments, including disruption of sodium and L-type calcium currents, contributing to reduced excitability and altered AP morphology.

In terms of S1PR expression, a differential mRNA expression profile was observed revealing prominent basal endothelial expression of S1PR1-3. Following HGD, S1PR1 mRNA and protein expression increased with no observed changes in S1PR2 or S1PR3 protein levels. HGD/R increased endothelial inflammatory mediator and occludin mRNA expression with a temporal-dependent decrease in endothelial S1PR1 and claudin-5. Interestingly, we observed a positive and negative correlation between S1PR1 and S1PR2/3 with claudin-5, respectively. Selective S1PR1 agonism attenuated IL-1beta induced MMP-9 mRNA and activity. In conclusion, HGD/R acutely increases endothelial cell expression of S1PR1 which presents a potential therapeutic target within the cerebrovasculature following ischemia-reperfusion injury. Additionally, HGD/R may potentially induce a phenotypic transformation within HBMECs, in which occludin expression predominates over claudin-5.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

High-content imaging (HCI), which has been developed for static microscopy, applied to time-lapse imaging can quantify how single-cell states change through time. Here we show the ability of high-content live-cell time-lapse imaging (HCLTI) to quantify the onset and progression of one form of cell death called apoptosis. We apply the Live Cell Painting assay called ChromaLIVETM and develop an HCLTI analysis pipeline. We show that HCLTI can discern the morphology dynamics of cells undergoing apoptosis, and demonstrate that machine learning can predict apoptosis as early as 100 minutes after exposing HeLa cells to the apoptosis inducer Staurosporine. This technical advancement paves the way for future studies to better understand the dynamics of other forms of cell death. Understanding cell death dynamics is one piece of solving larger biomedical puzzles like understanding how cells resist death (e.g., therapeutic resistance of cancer cells) and how cells die too soon (e.g., neurodegeneration).", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

We investigate the possibility to disrupt motor activity via premotor and parietal cortex stimulation, by inducing cortical silent periods (cSPs) in the voluntarily activated upper limb. Methods. We analyzed data from 17 subjects with normal brain function, using navigated TMS (nTMS) on individual MR anatomies. We applied single-pulse biphasic stimulation at 120% of resting motor threshold (rMT) in blocks of 30 stimulations on each spot of a 10-16 point grid covering the inferior parietal and frontal lobes in the dominant hemisphere while participants performed voluntary submaximal contraction. Electromyography (EMG) was recorded bilaterally from intrinsic hand muscles. Results. We observed cSPs not preceded by a MEP in the contralateral hand in 16/17 participants. The maximum overlap, of individual areas where such MEP-independent cSPs could be evoked, corresponded to the ventral precentral gyrus (MNI coordinates: [x=-57, y=7, z=33]). In a subset of stimulus sites, MEP-independent cSPs were bilateral, with contralateral predominance. Canonical short-latency MEPs were observed in all patients, with maximum overlap over the primary motor cortex. We also observed rare contralateral long-latency (> 23 ms) MEP-like responses from peri-Rolandic TMS. Conclusions. MEP-independent cSPs are systematically elicitable in healthy participants They likely reflect interference with premotor representations of ongoing movements. They offer a novel possibility to investigate higher-order motor functions in the experimental and clinical neurosciences.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

In mice, retinal waves begin embryonically and continue until eye opening at the end of the second postnatal week. During this time, the mechanisms for generating and propagating retinal waves are changing, thus causing retinal waves to exhibit highly dynamic spatiotemporal properties from one day to the next. Critically, the spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves have been shown to instruct the development of the visual system, including eye-specific segregation, retinotopic mapping, direction selectivity, and potentially retinal vascularization. Currently, there is no method for the automatic detection and high-throughput analysis of the spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves. To overcome this barrier, we have created a toolbox to automatically detect retinal waves and analyze their spatiotemporal properties from data collected using multielectrode arrays or calcium imaging. We apply this toolbox to enrich our understanding of retinal waves. First, we recapitulate and uncover novel dynamic spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves in the first two postnatal weeks. Second, we apply this toolbox on ultra long physiological recordings to demonstrate that the spatiotemporal properties of waves change throughout the day in an age-dependent manner. Third, we demonstrate that this toolbox can detect waves in the presence of pharmacological agents that increase the baseline firing of neurons, potentially enabling the discovery of novel factors that perturb retinal waves and visual development. Our toolbox is an intuitive interface that provides a systemized method to segregate and analyze retinal waves and other wave-like data.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Dengue virus (DENV) cross-reactive antibodies can facilitate ZIKV placental transcytosis and enhance ZIKV infection of placenta macrophage-Hofbauer cells through binding to Fc-{gamma} receptors (Fc{gamma}Rs). To understand the role of individual Fc{gamma}R in antibody-mediated ZIKV placental infection, we generated a comprehensive panel of Fc-variants spanning a wide range of binding affinities to different Fc{gamma}Rs. We found that mutations with increased affinity to Fc{gamma}RI strongly correlated with an increased frequency of infected pro-monocytic U937 and Hofbauer cells. Next, we genetically deleted individual Fc{gamma}R in U937 cells, and found that the knockout of FCGR1A gene completely abolished ZIKV infection. In contrast, the deletion of FCGR2B gene showed no effect on ZIKV infection, and the deletion of FCGR2A gene had only a moderate impact on ZIKV infection. We further observed that Fc{gamma}RI was involved in both increased ZIKV internalization and replication. Collectively, our results establish Fc{gamma}RI as the key Fc receptor responsible for antibody-mediated ZIKV infection in both U937 and primary placental macrophages. These mechanistic findings not only provide insight into the importance of Fc{gamma}RI in ZIKV vertical transmission but also highlight Fc{gamma}RI as a potential therapeutic target, with significant implications for the development of strategies to prevent ZIKV transmission from mother to fetus.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Because platelet function and stability are shaped by donor sex and storage conditions, these same factors are likely to influence the PEVs they release. Understanding these influences is key to developing PEVs into a safe and dependable therapeutic option. In this study, we investigated how donor sex and platelet storage affect the therapeutic properties of PEVs. To address this, PEVs were isolated from platelets of healthy male and female donors. Platelets were either processed immediately after blood collection to represent a resting state or stored overnight at room temperature on a rocker to mimic platelet storage conditions. PEVs isolated from these preparations displayed similar size, morphology, and cellular uptake across groups, but their biological effects diverged. Female PEVs, particularly from resting platelets, provided the strongest protection against thrombin-induced endothelial barrier disruption, stabilized junctional proteins, and reduced oxidative stress. Male PEVs showed weaker barrier protection compared to female-derived PEVs but more pronounced modulation of certain inflammatory mediators. In addition, PEVs derived from resting platelets (RP-PEVs) consistently showed stronger protective effects than those from stored platelets (SP-PEVs), regardless of donor sex. These results highlight that donor sex and platelet storage influence PEVs function and underscore the need to account for both when developing PEV-based therapies.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Using an unbiased proteomic approach, we here identified the bridge-like lipid transport protein VPS13C/PARK23 as a key component of a global early response pathway to lysosome damage. VPS13C readily binds lysosomes under mechanical or osmotic tension in anticipation of membrane lesions. The latter trigger a conformational change in the protein's C-terminus, involving its ATG2C domain acting as sensor of damage-induced lipid packing defects. We show that ER-lysosome contacts formed by VPS13C provide critical binding platforms for OSBP/ORPs to enable efficient ER wrapping of damaged lysosomes.

A.; Hof, C.; Bybee, S.; Brandl, R.; Pinkert, S.", "abstract": "The Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) conceptualizes that temperature is the primary driver of species richness, a pattern well supported in terrestrial taxa but less certain for freshwater organisms. Limited global-scale evidence and frequent violations of MTEs assumptions, particularly the stationarity of body size and abundance, further obscure its applicability. In freshwatersystems, body size and abundance are tightly linked to dispersal and range size, which differ markedly between running-water (lotic) and standing-water (lentic) species, as proposed by the Habitat-Stability-Dispersal Hypothesis (HSDH). Adaptations to habitat stability may therefore generate distinct biogeographical trait patterns and modify richness-temperature relationships predicted by MTE. Utilizing comprehensive global functional, phylogenetic, and distributional data on dragonfly and damselfly species (83%) and habitat information (46%), we tested MTE predictions for lentic versus lotic species. Lotic species richness followed MTE expectations (slope: -0.469) more closely than lentic species richness (slope: -0.283). The proportion of lentic species in an assemblage was the strongest predictor of deviation in the species richness-temperature relationship (R2 = 38%). Assemblages dominated by lentic species clustered in climatically unstable regions and mainly including smaller-bodied species with larger ranges. Phylogenetic comparative analysis shows a strong phylogenetic signal in habitat preference, with the most species rich and northernly distributed families comprising predominately lentic species. Our findings suggest that adaptations to habitat stability facilitated the colonization and persistence of lentic species in harsh and fluctuating climates both past and present causing largely divergent species richness patterns of lentic and lotic odonates. Integrating HSDH-related traits (body and range size) not only substantially improves the explanatory power of the MTE, but also reveals a trait syndrome with broad implications for the biogeography and climate change responses of freshwater communities.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

The ability to selectively identify and study these states is crucial for under-standing the dynamic nature of proteins and their roles in cellular processes, yet can be currently limited by the artefacts of existing molecular labels and the lack of strategies to exploit them in diverse ways. Whilst i) methods for the photochemical perturbation of pro-teins and ii) photophysical protein probes and sensors are both known powerful tools, simultaneous methods for site- and context-specific photochemical modification of a protein side chain with concomitant modulation of photophysical properties would allow interrogation of protein function via diverse modes (potentially reporting simultaneously on structure and dynamics of ground- and reactive- state properties). Due to their mechanistic complexity, rational approaches for the design of suitable photochemical strategies can be difficult and non-intuitive. Here, we describe a high-throughput experimentation (HTE) strategy designed to allow the photochemical modification of a genetically-encoded, minimally disruptive ('zero-size'), photophysically-active - yet typically unreac-tive and biologically-inert - unnatural amino acid (uAA) residue in proteins. The discovery of a novel dearomative, formal [4+3] photocycloaddition of imidazopyrimidine reagents which proceeds via photochemically generated carbon-centred radical intermediates with polyaromatic substrates enabled chemoselective application to the normally unreactive Trp-mimetic residue, 2-naphthylalanine (Npa). Npa's site-selective installation allows dual photo-chemical and photophysical dearomative perturbation benignly and efficiently in proteins. Replacement of Trp in the archetypal apoptotic biosensor protein Annexin A5 (AnxV) enabled dual photochemical-photophysical determination of switched, conforma-tionally-determined reactive states induced by Ca2+-binding, without any apparent functional perturbation of its in vitro or cellular recognition of phospholipids, indicating an ordered annexin mechanism. This ready and benign unification of photochemistry and photophysics suggests a general approach for using high-throughput light-mediated experimentation in artefact-free chemical biology to capture different functional states of proteins and to interrogate those states using combined photochemical-photophysical methods.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we combined single cell mechanical characterization of primary adipocytes with microfluidic hydrogel fabrication, quantitative multiparametric imaging, Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations, and in vivo experiments to elucidate these connections. First, we quantified the heterogeneous size and stiffness of primary adipocytes, and replicated these properties by fabricating adipocyte-sized polyacrylamide (PAAm) beads with tunable elasticity. Subsequently, we embedded these beads into type I collagen, the primary fibrillar extracellular matrix (ECM) component of breast adipose tissue, to form 3D granular hydrogels mimicking aspects of native adipose tissue architecture. Granular hydrogels embedded with beads demonstrated increased breast cancer cell invasion relative to bead-free controls, an effect that was more pronounced with soft versus stiff beads and correlated with increased collagen fiber alignment and hierarchical organization. In addition, live cell imaging and DEM simulations revealed that soft beads promoted invasion relative to stiff beads by deforming in response to confined cancer cell migration. Fiber alignment and adipocyte deformation trends were validated in vivo via intravital imaging of cancer cell migration in mammary fat pads of mice, and suggest that adipocyte mechanics regulate breast cancer invasion by coordinating both ECM architecture and cellular confinement.

We have previously shown that tropomyosin receptor kinase (Trk) neurotrophin receptors regulate ES cell viability, and the pan-Trk and kinase inhibitor K252a restored sensitivity to chemotherapy in ES cells. Here, we show that systemic administration of K252a in mice delays ES tumor growth and reduces expression and activity of multiple targets. Methods: BALB/c nu/nu nude mice inoculated with SK-ES-1 ES cells were given daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of K252a for 18 days. Immunohistochemical analysis of tumors was performed to quantify the expression and phosphorylation of Trk receptors, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R). The effect of combined therapy with K252a and an IGF1R inhibitor was tested in SK-ES-1 cells in vitro. Associations between expression of genes encoding Trks, PI3G, and IGF1R and overall survival (OS) in patients with ES was examined. Results: Treatment with K252a led to a transient delay in ES tumor growth without affecting body weight or serum biochemical markers, and reduced the protein expression and phosphorylation of TrkA, TrkB, PI3K, and IGF1R. Combined treatment with K252a and the IGF1R inhibitor NVP-ADW742 was more effective in reducing ES cell viability than each compound alone.

In a greenhouse experiment, we inoculated cash crops with rhizosphere and nodule microbiomes derived from different legume cover crops. We found that bacterial communities were markedly different between the rhizosphere and nodules of cover crops, indicating strong habitat differentiation. Interestingly, the cover crop inoculum did not substantially alter the taxonomic composition of cash crop nodule communities, suggesting strong partner selectivity by the cash crop host. However, cover crop identity strongly affected nodule formation and, to a lesser extent, total biomass of cash crops. For alfalfa and soybean, a higher abundance of their respective rhizobial partners in cover crop nodule inocula increased total biomass and nodule number for these cash crop species, respectively.

S.; Schwiedrzik, C. M.", "abstract": "The primate visual system is a hierarchical network of brain areas that transform retinal inputs into rich percepts. According to efficient neural coding principles, basic visual features such as orientation, which are already represented in early visual areas, should not be redundantly encoded in higher areas like V4 and inferotemporal (IT) cortex. We tested this hypothesis by quantifying orientation representation throughout the entire visual stream using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) in macaque monkeys watching full-field gratings. Contrary to predictions from efficient coding, we found robust orientation information along the entire visual ventral stream from V1 to IT cortex. Orientation information was distributed in cortical and representational space, especially in IT. Voxels with multivariate responsiveness to faces, objects, and bodies carried more orientation information than highly category-selective voxels. They also displayed stronger connectivity within IT and with upstream areas V1-V4. These finding suggests the existence of functional \"hubs\" that integrate low- and high-level features through enhanced connectivity. This phenomenon generalized to deep convolutional neural network models with high brain similarity, underscoring the importance of hub-like units in hierarchical processing of complex inputs. Together, our results show that orientation re-emerges in IT cortex not through redundancy but as a computational byproduct of functional diversity and connectivity, propounding the existence of \"hub\" neurons that may support flexible, integrative visual processing beyond object recognition.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

However, there is mixed evidence on how KOR-modulation of dopamine affects operant behavior in the absence of addiction. To address this gap, we injected dLight1.2 in the nucleus accumbens of male and female C57BL/6J mice and trained them to self-administer sucrose. Mice were injected with the KOR agonist U50,488H, with or without the KOR antagonist aticaprant, prior to each session. U50,488H did not affect dopamine responses during the lever press and did not alter total presses or consumption. The primary effects of KOR activation were to delay initiation of lever pressing, and to diminish the rapid ramp-up in dopamine seen before lever presses. The first lever press of each session was preceded by the largest dopamine ramp; however, ramp size did not correlate with latency under any condition. We further tested whether KOR-modulation of dopamine ramps affects behavior throughout the session. We found that the total amount of dopamine activity 10 seconds before the lever press predicted when the next lever press would occur, specifically after U50,488H injection. When the phasic peaks were subtracted from this to quantify a slower dopamine ramp, time to the next lever press could be predicted and this effect was strongest after U50,488H injection. As U50,488H reduces basal dopamine signaling, we propose that dopamine ramps prior to behavior have a larger signal-to-noise ratio during KOR activation. This relatively greater increase in dopamine from baseline could increase the salience of the decision to perform reward-associated actions, which may play a role in habitual behaviors like drug taking.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we asked how individual variability of social profiles is shaped at adolescence and whether the profiles are associated with regional brain metabolites and gene expressions in the adult brain. At adolescence we determined a 'dominant' profile expressing more dominance, a 'submissive' profile expressing more submission and an 'explorer' profile showing more novelty exploration than social interaction. Adolescent social behaviors are conserved at adulthood. Our data suggest that dominance tendencies already present at adolescence are likely to stabilize throughout life, thus shaping future social behaviors. Our results show that social profiles are not related to sex and life environment. However, being more dominant, interactive and socially motivated shape dopaminergic olfactory activity at adolescence. Also, showing the explorer or submissive profiles is associated with an opposite serotonin pattern in the cerebellum, but a similar kynurenine pattern in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum, thus pointing toward major neurotransmitter systems in key regions for brain health.

Mice were vaccinated intranasally with Fluzone alone or combined with either Infectimune, a cationic lipid nanoparticle adjuvant, or TRAC478, a synthetic dual toll-like receptor liposome adjuvant containing TLR4 and TLR7/8 agonists. In immunologically naive mice, a higher inoculation volume was more effective at eliciting protective antibody responses even though the same dose of vaccine antigen was used for vaccination. Fluzone mixed with adjuvant enhanced hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) titers and all mice were protected against influenza virus challenge. Mice with pre-existing anti-influenza virus immunity that was elicited by prior infection with historical influenza strains had modest antibody responses and full protection following immunization with unadjuvanted vaccine. However, the inclusion of an adjuvant with Fluzone significantly raised HAI titers and HA-specific IgG levels. Pre-immune mice vaccinated with Fluzone mixed with either adjuvant had low to undetectable viral lung titers following challenge. Overall, intranasally delivered split-inactivated influenza vaccines paired with a mucosal adjuvant is a promising strategy to enhance vaccine effectiveness.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

We analysed 504,723 publications over the past decade from 350 Scopus-indexed ecology and evolution journals to compare publication rates and institutional diversity a) between Subscription-Based (SB) and OA publishing models, and b) before and after journals transitioned to fully OA, across country income groups. We found that both publication rates and institutional diversity were lower in the OA publishing model, but with variable differences across country groups. These differences were weaker (by ~140%) in low-income countries (where full waivers on Article Publishing Charges (APCs) are automatically provided) compared to middle-income countries (where only discounts on APCs are provided). For journals transitioning to a fully OA publication model, publication diversity decreased in middle-income countries and increased significantly in low-income countries. Therefore, OA disproportionately concentrates publishing potential within a few institutions, undermining authorship equity. The OA model, despite its egalitarian philosophy, risks amplifying geographic and institutional disparities in ecology and conservation science. Incorporating models that account for individual and institutional-level variations in funding availability, or providing alternative pathways for publishing, may help reduce this disparity.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce MetaboFM, a foundation model for spatial metabolomics that consolidates thousands of public MSI datasets into standardized spatial spectral tensors and extracts transferable embeddings using pretrained Vision Transformers. We curated and standardized around 4000 publicly available MSI datasets from the METASPACE repository, spanning multiple organisms, tissue types, ionization modes, and instruments. Across six metadata prediction tasks: encompassing organism, ionization polarity, tissue type, condition, analyzer type, and ionization source, embeddings from pretrained MetaboFM encoders achieved a mean macro F1 of 0.74 and accuracy of 0.80 with linear probes, demonstrating substantially higher discriminative power than classical principal component analysis (PCA) or randomly initialized baselines by over 20 percentage points. To interpret the learned representations, we mapped embedding directions back to the m/z domain, revealing distinct spectral regions that drive class separation across tissues, conditions, and ionization sources. A multimodal visual question answering (VQA) extension further links MSI embeddings with natural-language queries through a cross-attention fusion module, attaining an average macro F1 of 0.61 across tasks. Finally, an interactive Gradio interface enables users to visualize MSI patches and query sample metadata in free form language.

In addition to voltage, hHv1 is regulated by other stimuli, including pH gradients, mechanical forces, and ligands such as Zn2+. Aside from the VSDs, this membrane protein contains an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal coiled-coil domain (CC) formed between the monomers. To address the need for direct measurements of conformational rearrangements in hHv1, we developed a Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) approach to measuring the conformational rearrangements in full-length hHv1 purified from E. coli. We used genetic code expansion (GCE) to generate a library of 14 full-length hHv1 constructs, each incorporating the fluorescent noncanonical amino acid acridon-2-ylalanine (Acd) at a different site throughout the various structural domains. Following the expression and purification of these hHv1-Acd proteins, we found that 12 sites yielded stable and functional proton-permeable channels. The fluorescence properties of Acd at each site showed small site-specific differences. Furthermore, we measured site-specific FRET efficiencies from tryptophan (Trp) and tyrosine (Tyr) to Acd in the hHv1-Acd proteins and found results consistent with correct folding in detergent micelles.

Subtotal TFUS (~40% volumetric ablation fraction, matching clinical trial results) was applied to EMT6 tumors in aVEGFR2 treated BALB/c mice. In EMT6 tumors, TFUS or aVEGFR2 alone had no effect on tumor growth, but their combination eradicated 50% of tumors and drove 83% rechallenge rejection, with CD4/CD8 depletion confirming that tumor eradication and rechallenge rejection were T cell dependent. TFUS + aPD1 yielded modest benefit, whereas triple therapy (TFUS + aVEGFR2 + aPD1) cured 81% of mice and induced durable, T cell mediated immunity.

Here, we establish a novel mouse model of selective bladder mucosal afferent denervation using intravesical instillation of resiniferatoxin (RTX) to define the functional roles of these fibres in health and disease. We assessed the impact of mucosal denervation on sensory nerve activity and bladder function in healthy mice and in a model of urinary tract infection (UTI) induced by acute bacterial challenge with uropathogenic E. coli. We show that mucosa-innervating afferents do not influence bladder distension responses or voiding function under healthy conditions. In contrast, during UTI, these afferents become hypersensitive and serve as critical drivers of infection-induced pelvic pain and urinary frequency, responses that contribute to enhanced bacterial clearance.

However, no model in this class has been shown to account for the phenomenon known as choice-induced preference change, wherein decision makers tend to rate options higher after they choose them and lower after they reject them (and often choose the option that they had initially rated lower). Studies have reported choice-induced preference change for many decades, and the principal findings are robust. The resulting spreading of alternatives (SoA) in terms of their subjective value ratings is incompatible with traditional sequential sampling models, which consider the rated values of the options to be stationary throughout choice deliberation. Here, we propose that extending the basic DDM to incorporate independent attributes into the drift rate can allow this class of model to account for SoA. Critically, the extended model assumes that choice deliberation does not always involve the same set of attributes as is involved in individual evaluations of the same options. We show that this model can generate SoA (while simultaneously accounting for consistency and RT), as well as the relationships between SoA and choice difficulty, attribute disparity, and RT previously reported in the literature.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Numerous putative CBD receptors including cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, as well as Trpv1 and Trpa1, the receptors for capsaicin and mustard-oil (AITC) respectively, have been proposed to contribute to CBD-mediated analgesia. Larval zebrafish have several attributes that lend themselves to inquiries into the biology of nociception. The neural circuits underlying nociception in zebrafish larvae are highly analogous to those found in higher vertebrates. Notably, the small size and optical clarity of zebrafish enable holistic evaluation of analgesic function utilizing behavioral and imaging platforms. Here we report that in larval zebrafish CBD serves both anti- and pro-nociceptive functions. Utilizing place aversion assays as a proxy for nociception, we found that low concentrations of CBD inhibit aversion to noxious chemical stimuli including AITC and acetic acid. Counterintuitively, we found that higher concentrations of CBD potentiated nocifensive behavior as measured by enhanced thermal aversion and increased locomotion. Knockdown of Trpa1b eliminated the algogenic effects of CBD while having no effect on its analgesic properties, as it abolished trpa1b+ sensory neuron responses to CBD, CBD-evoked thermal hypersensitivity, and increased locomotion in Trpa1b-null animals. Strikingly, CBD profoundly inhibited thermal aversion to noxious heat in Trpa1b-null animals but not in wildtype animals, indicating that CBD-mediated Trpa1b activation can oppose the analgesic properties of CBD. These studies provide a framework to investigate the genetic and neural substrates of CBD-mediated analgesia and nociception.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

This is largely through the multiple cytokines these cells release upon activation, which have downstream effects on the scope and magnitude of virus-specific T and B cells, and antibodies which form. Here, we examined the contribution of NKT cells using pigs, which are considered a highly translational model of human influenza A infection. CD1D-expressing and CD1D-deficient pigs that respectively possess and lack NKT cells were infected with the swine influenza virus H3N2 A/Swine/Colorado/23619/1999 (CO99), with or without prior mucosal immunization with a recombinant H3N2 A/Swine/Texas/4199-2/1998 (TX98) modified live vaccine encoding a truncated NS1 protein (TX98 NS1{Delta}126). Vaccination reduced virus load and pulmonary pathology by similar amounts in both genotypes. However, NKT cells status had a significant impact on the underlying immune response: Unlike following vaccination, virus-specific T cell expansion after infection was greater in CD1D-deficient than -intact pigs, indicating that NKT cells play opposing roles in different phases of the immune response. NKT cell-deficient pigs also had reduced T cells cuffing around airways and higher numbers of expanded T and B cell clones according to single-cell {beta} T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing. Using our newly developed porcine-specific {gamma} and {delta} chain primers, we characterized the pulmonary {gamma}{delta} TCR repertoire. This revealed a high frequency of expanded clones, especially within the CD2- subset, and a tendency for larger expansion in NKT cell-expressing pigs.

Drawing on a wealth of empirical data, we integrate prey capture, engulfment, and internal and external digestion into a mathematical evolutionary model that quantifies the fitness of a primitive phagocytoser relative to a non-phagocytosing ancestor. We reveal the conditions under which a non-phagocytosing predator that digests its prey externally can persist. We also show that the phagocytoser can outperform the ancestor in a broad range of situations, despite the cost associated with producing a phagocytic cup. Parameter variations delineate how fast engulfment needs to be for phagocytosis to be advantageous, providing clear benchmarks for interpreting the importance of results in genetic knockout studies and mechanical models. The phagocytoser still outperforms the ancestor when food vacuoles can't fuse back to the plasma membrane, providing arguments in favor of the gradual evolution of phagocytosis and for phagocytosis as the initiator of the endomembrane system.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

In many nematodes, PDE is initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which lead to chromosome fragmentation and subsequent DNA loss. However, the mechanism of nematode DNA breakage remains largely unclear. Interestingly, in the human and pig parasitic nematode Ascaris, no conserved motif or sequence structures are present at chromosomal breakage regions (CBRs), suggesting the recognition of CBRs may be sequence-independent. Using Hi-C, we revealed that Ascaris CBRs engage in three-dimensional (3D) interactions before PDE, indicating that physical contacts of the break regions may contribute to the PDE process. The 3D interactions are established in both Ascaris male and female germlines, demonstrating inherent genome organization associated with the CBRs and to-be-eliminated sequences. In contrast, in the unichromosomal horse parasite Parascaris univalens, transient and pairwise interactions between two neighboring CBRs that would form the ends of future somatic chromosomes were observed only during PDE. Intriguingly, we found specific spatial compartmentalization changes in the Ascaris chromosomes after PDE converts 24 germline chromosomes into 36 somatic ones. Remarkably, Parascaris PDE generates the same set of 36 somatic chromosomes, and the compartment changes following PDE are consistent between the two species.

However, the key features in mitotic gene conversion, including its efficiency, the length of conversion track, and its dependency on specific recombination proteins, remain largely undefined. Here, we show that allele-specific CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSBs, without exogenous donor templates, can efficiently correct a heterozygous pathogenic variant (c.1582C>T; p.Arg528Trp) in the ATAD3A gene of patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Amplicon-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed that approximately 38%~53% of edited iPSCs carried two wild-type ATAD3A alleles. Notably, over 99% of the corrected alleles derived from the homologous chromosome, indicating that the repair occurred mainly via interallelic gene conversion. Long-range amplicon nanopore sequencing coupled with haplotype analysis showed that the majority of gene conversion tracts was less than 2 kilobases in length. Whole-genome sequencing of three corrected iPSC clones showed the absence of large deletions or structural rearrangements at the ATAD3A target site. However, one clone carried a heterozygous deletion in ATAD3B locus, suggesting that CRISPR-Cas9 can introduce off-target genomic alterations. Knockdown of key HR proteins, including RAD51, CtIP, and BRCA1/2, significantly reduced the correction efficiency, indicating that the gene conversion relies on a RAD51-dependent HR pathway.

Six ICMS frequencies (10-500 Hz) and contralateral visual LED stimuli were delivered in repeated sessions. Oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) was estimated from dual-wavelength reflectance, and hemodynamic response functions (OERFs) were derived via regularized deconvolution of calcium and OEF time courses. Over the chronic period, 25-Hz ICMS evoked progressively larger calcium responses whose duration was extending, while spatial spread remained stable around 500 micron. Concurrently, OEF reductions deepened, reflecting decreased relative blood supply, and the spatial extent of OEF signals contracted in the first week before expanding by day 21. After discharge-like calcium events emerged in nearly half of mice, predominantly under 25-Hz ICMS. OERF peak amplitude increased between day 0 and days 7-21, with latency decreasing. Chronic ICMS induces progressive potentiation of neuronal and vascular responses alongside focal neurovascular uncoupling and sustained silencing of spontaneous activity near the implant.

Adult fish were chronically exposed to an environmentally relevant PFAS mixture (perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) + perfluorooctanoate (PFOA)) under three warming scenarios. Tissue PFAS concentrations, whole-organism metabolic rates, swimming performance, reproductive parameters and somatic indices were assessed. Temperature modified PFAS tissue concentrations in a compound- and tissue-specific manner, notably promoting PFOA redistribution to eggs. Metabolic responses were temperature-dependent: at 26 deg C, higher tissue PFAS concentrations were associated with elevated standard and maximum metabolic rates (SMR and MMR), maintaining aerobic scope (AS). At 28.5 deg C, SMR remained stable while MMR and AS declined with rising PFAS, indicating reduced oxygen available for energetically demanding activities. Despite unchanged swimming and reproductive outputs, an increased hepatosomatic index with increasing tissue PFAS concentrations and altered PFAS distribution suggest detoxification costs.

Here, we show how HAESA-LIKE 3 (HSL3) specifically recognizes the folded, disulfide-stabilized CTNIP/SCREW phytocytokines in Arabidopsis. Quantitative binding assays define a minimal CTNIP4 region required for high-affinity HSL3 interaction and signaling activation. A 2.12 [A] crystal structure of the HSL3-CTNIP4 complex reveals a unique C-terminal receptor pocket that accommodates the cyclic architecture of the peptide through a combination of hydrophobic and polar contacts, a feature absent in the closely related HAE/HSL LRR-RKs. The cyclic CTNIP4 fold further establishes a largely hydrophobic interface that bridges HSL3 to the SERK co-receptor, forming a distinct activation surface. Together, these structural, biochemical and physiological insights uncover a previously unrecognised mechanism of peptide perception and receptor activation, highlighting how subtle architectural variations enable precise ligand selectivity among highly conserved plant receptor kinases.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

We generated Csnk2b haploinsufficient (Csnk2b+/-) mice that recapitulate core clinical features: ASD-like social and cognitive deficits, heightened anxiety, spontaneous seizures, cortical and hippocampal structural compromise, and reduced PV-interneuron density with impaired cortical inhibition. Neonatal brain-wide AAV-PHP.eB-mediated CSNK2B replacement (hsyn or CAG promoters, retro-orbital P3) restored cortical/hippocampal structure, normalized neuronal numbers, prolonged survival, and ameliorated seizures and ASD-like behaviors with comparable efficacy across promoters. Critically, treatment also corrected quantitative EEG signatures that are directly deployable in human trials: theta and gamma band power were normalized, theta/gamma (and beta/gamma) ratios recovered, and inter-areal coherence and gamma-band effective connectivity were restored, indicating re-established excitation/inhibition balance and large-scale network coordination. These EEG endpoints constitute a compact, noninvasive biomarker panel of target engagement and physiological efficacy that can be harmonized with clinical EEG to support dose finding, early decision-making, and longitudinal monitoring in CSNK2B gene-therapy trials.

Even with the potential usefulness of linezolid, the mechanisms that drive linezolid resistance in M. abscessus remain poorly understood. In several bacterial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family proteins of the F subtype (ABC-F) have been found to confer antibiotic resistance to ribosome-targeting antibiotics, including linezolid.

Through bioinformatic and molecular docking analyses Altiratinib was shown to selectively bind conserved catalytic motifs of PRP4K homologs in T. annulata (TA21325) and Theileria parva (TpMuguga_01g00303), with reduced affinity observed upon L715F mutation.

Proteomic profiling revealed disruption of host and parasite RNA splicing and translation machinery. Altiratinib further induced G1-phase arrest, inhibited cMET mediated signaling, and suppressed DNA synthesis. Additionally, it triggered oxidative stress, mitochondrial depolarization, and ROS mediated DNA damage, culminating in p53 activation and caspase 9 driven intrinsic apoptosis. Downregulation of TaSP expression reinforced its selective targeting of parasite-infected cells.

While its role in reducing drug susceptibility is well established, the broader consequences of resistance mutations on bacterial physiology and behavior during infection remain poorly understood. Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered among the highest-priority bacterial threats, with resistance commonly driven by loss-of-function mutations in the carbapenem uptake porin OprD. Here we show that such mutations can arise in clinical isolates even without prior carbapenem treatment, indicating that their effects during infection extend beyond antibiotic resistance. Consistent with this, we found that oprD mutants exhibit enhanced early attachment to and translocation across airway epithelial barriers in infection models, an effect maintained across strains with distinct clinical genomic backgrounds and infection dynamics. Our findings indicate that loss of OprD alters the bacterial outer membrane charge and reduces mucus entrapment, thereby facilitating epithelial barrier colonization.

To understand host-driven disease heterogeneity, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on human colon organoids (HCOs) derived from three healthy adult donors following EAEC 042 infection. Surprisingly, despite comparable EAEC adherence across donors, we observed striking donor-specific responses to infection at multiple levels. A total of seven distinct colonic epithelial cell clusters were identified, with striking donor-specific baseline compositions. Following infection, the HCO donors exhibited three distinct response phenotypes evident in both cell type remodeling and gene regulation: hyperresponsive, intermediate, and non-responsive. We further observed extensive donor-specific cell-cell communication networks at baseline and after EAEC infection.

U.", "abstract": "Natural hydrocarbon seeps and hydrocarbons resulting from human activities are the primary conduits by which oil enters the sea. Marine Cyanobacteria, among the most abundant photosynthetic organisms in the world, produce alkanes, an additional hydrocarbon source to the sea. Alkane production proceeds via metabolism of fatty acid intermediates with a fatty acyl-ACP reductase (FAAR) and an aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO). These alkanes can be consumed with alkane hydroxylases, including alkane 1-monooxygenase (alkB). The production and consumption of alkanes in the photic zone is termed the short-term hydrocarbon cycle (STHC). Yet, an active STHC has not been substantiated through gene expression analyses. To determine if the STHC is active in the marine photic zone we evaluated over 9000 genomes to which metatranscriptome reads from a site in the Gulf of Mexico were recruited. In these samples, FAAR and ADO expression was dominated by Prochlorococcus and to a lesser extent Synechococcus. Bacterial alkane consumption via alkB was dominated by Pseudomonadota, SAR324, and Bacteroidota alkB gene expression. Additionally, archaeal alkane consumption utilizing this same n-alkane degradation pathway was observed in the transcript data by Thermoplasmatota, classified as Marine Group II and III, the most abundant planktonic archaeal groups. Active production of alkanes in the photic zone would be an important component of marine hydrocarbon cycle and more broadly of carbon cycling. Further, consumption of hydrocarbons, regardless of source, is a fundamentally important ecosystem cleanup service provided by microbes in the ocean.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Using a targeted genome mining strategy, we identified more than 60 biosynthetic gene clusters that combine PUFA synthase-like, polyketide synthase (PKS), and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) enzymes across diverse bacterial lineages. Comparative analysis revealed extensive diversification of these triple hybrid pathways through gene fusion, domain reshuffling and recruitment of accessory enzymes.

The chitinimines exhibit surfactant properties, as well as moderate antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and contribute to a growth-promoting interaction between C. koreensis and Salmonella spp. Together, these findings demonstrate that PUFA synthase-like systems are far more versatile than previously appreciated, playing a key role in combinatorial biosynthetic innovation and serving as a rich, untapped source of chemically and functionally diverse specialized lipids.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Immunoblotting of whole cell lysates resolved discrete, strain-modulated bands under basal conditions and after physiologically relevant L lactate pulses (4 or 16 mM). A conserved 42 45 kDa species was detected across strains, including in the absence of added lactate. Sample load titrations revealed additional low-intensity bands, consistent with substoichiometric occupancy typical of a regulatory post-translational modification (PTM). Because Campylobacter, a member of the Epsilonproteobacteria, relies on amino acid driven, microaerophilic metabolism, we propose that endogenous and host-derived lactate generates lactyl donors (e.g., lactyl CoA or lactoyl glutathione) that enable Kla.

It also limits spontaneous- and virus-induced innate immune responses by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine and type-I interferon (IFN-I) production. Some viruses escape SAMHD1 restriction by utilizing SAMHD1-mediated innate immune suppression to establish effective infection through viral antagonism. Our previous studies showed that SAMHD1 is a proviral factor facilitating replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in human macrophages, monocytic THP-1 and epithelial-like HEK293T cell lines by suppressing IFN responses. However, it is unclear about the function of SAMHD1 in lung epithelial cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we report that SAMHD1 facilitates SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung epithelial Calu-3 cells by enhancing endogenous expression of the viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1) and HNF1{beta}. Using pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and lentiviral vectors, we found that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-mediated viral entry was suppressed in Calu-3 cells with SAMHD1 knockout (KO). SAMHD1 KO repressed ACE2 expression in Calu-3 cells at mRNA and protein levels. Functional analyses revealed that HNF1 and HNF1{beta} were crucial for the endogenous ACE2 expression in Calu-3 cells. Additionally, SAMHD1 KO led to a reduction in the expression levels and ACE2-promoting function of HNF1 and HNF1{beta}. Inhibition of IFN antiviral response by baricitinib, a Janus kinase 1 and 2 (JAK 1/2) inhibitor, did not revert the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 in SAMHD1 KO Calu-3 cells.

The significance of this cleavage remained unclear. Here, we determined that the yeast subunit  expressed in T. brucei was not proteolytically processed, despite significant structural similarities. The proteolytic recognition sequence was identified to be largely contained within the octapeptide and replacing it with a flexible linker rendered the protein resistant to cleavage. This uncleaved subunit  restored growth after RNAi depletion of endogenous subunit  by incorporating into F1Fo-ATP synthase complexes capable of both ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. A FRET-based assay revealed that peptides consisting of either the first or second octapeptide cleavage site experienced significantly more proteolysis when incubated with cytosolic lysates compared to mitochondrial extracts. Furthermore, expressing just the mature C-terminal polypeptide resulted in mitochondrial localization, suggesting it contains an internal targeting signal.

We propose that biotic interactions within microbial communities may help to fill this gap, specifically cross-kingdom interactions between fungi and bacteria, as these are increasingly found to be important to both assembly and function. We hypothesized that direct interactions between bacterial and fungal taxa are an important driver of composition in low-diversity leaf habitats, where pairwise reciprocal interactions are more likely. In high-diversity root habitats, however, we expected diffuse, indirect interactions to be more relevant to composition. To test these hypotheses, we used 16S and ITS rRNA sequence analysis to characterize bacterial and fungal communities of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) leaves and roots within and across 14 stands spanning mountain to coastal ecoregions of North Carolina, USA. We analyzed putative direct and diffuse interactions using ecological network inference and examined the variance explained in microbial community composition using variance partitioning analysis with spatial, environmental, and biotic interactions as explanatory factors. Variance partitioning showed that cross-kingdom biotic interactions contribute to microbial community structure. The largest improvements to variance explained (5-11%) were from including direct interactions, except for root fungal communities where the variance explained by diffuse interactions (7.5%) was more than double that of direct interactions (2.8%). These contributions were comparable with those from environmental and spatial factors. The joint effects of putative biotic interactions and environmental conditions also contributed to the explained variation, highlighting the importance of the environmental tracking in microbes. These findings provide insight into using network inference for identifying putative cross-kingdom biotic interactions in plant-associated microbiomes and their contributions to microbiome assembly, which could guide the direction of future research on biotic interactions.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Out of 4,704 An. gambiae complex specimens collected, only 10 were identified as nominate An. gambiae by polymerase chain reaction. Seven of these were captured at three surveyed fishing camps inside a Wildlife Management Area (WMA), while none were caught in five established villages west of the WMA or the national park to the east. Two of the other three were found among scattered farming settlements along the edge of the WMA. The final individual was caught in a near-natural area deep inside the WMA, but even this site was near small transient homesteads. Poisson regression modelling confirmed that capture rates at fishing camps were higher than in the peripheral settlements (Relative Rate [RR] [95% Confidence Interval (CI)] = 0.088 [0.011, 0.695], P = 0.021) or conserved natural areas (RR [95% CI] = 0.043 [0.003, 0.495], P = 0.012). Conservative estimates put the mean standing populations at each of the three fishing camps between 26 and 41 females per settlement. The absence of An. gambiae from well-conserved areas without resident humans aligns with its anthropophagic nature and dependency on human hosts. Residual An. gambiae populations persisting among frontier communities appear linked to locally common, livelihood-related nocturnal activities that preclude the practical use of LLINs, specifically fishing and guarding crops against wildlife. The continued presence of this previously important species in these ecological niches, where local livelihoods apparently undermine high LLIN coverage, shows persistence under sustained, partial insecticide pressure. This could lead to the re-emergence of this vector through the gradual evolution of resistance.

Recently, we demonstrated that the widely distributed iron or manganese dependent superoxide dismutase (SodFM) family have undergone numerous metal-preference changes, including during evolutionary adaptation of pathogenic bacteria to altered metal availability within the host. Yet the underlying properties of metal-binding sites that control metalloenzyme metal-preference are unclear, and thus we lack an understanding of how enzymatic metal-preference can be re-shaped by evolution. Here, we used spectral features of bound iron or manganese, whose intensities reflect their oxidation state, to assess how their redox properties are tuned during SodFM evolution. We systematically analysed the metal oxidation state across diverse SodFMs from multiple phylogenetic groups with different catalytic metal-preferences, including those known to have undergone evolutionary metal-preference switching. We observed a striking relationship between resting oxidation state and catalytic metal-preferences. Mutagenesis of second-sphere residues previously identified as determining metal preference revealed that they modulate metal-dependent activity and cofactor oxidation state in tandem, demonstrating these properties are linked. Together, these data argue that the differing SodFM metal preferences observed across the tree of life evolved through tuning of their redox properties by the secondary coordination sphere.

The recent discovery of a proteasome-dependent degradation mechanism for chromatin-bound cGAS offers new insights into the regulation of nuclear cGAS. In this study, we examine the dynamics and stability of nuclear cGAS following DNA damage. We demonstrate that cGAS is released from chromatin in a process dependent on the p97 segregase, followed by its degradation. When protein degradation is blocked, cGAS accumulates in foci juxtaposed to PML nuclear bodies (PML NBs). We show that this juxtaposition is SUMO-dependent, with both SUMO and PML required for cGAS degradation, a process that also involves the Cullin3-RING E3 ubiquitin Ligase complex. Increasing cGAS levels on chromatin after damage by preventing its degradation expands its localization on chromatin, correlating with a dampened DNA damage response and impaired senescence entry. Overall, our findings show that a p97-PML NBs axis modulates cGAS abundance, ensuring proper regulation of the DNA damage response and balancing the possible cell-intrinsic activation of innate immune responses with senescence entry.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

These organelles also regulate energy homeostasis via redox signaling and substrate exchange between cellular compartments. Mitochondrial redox shuttles maintain the balance between cytosolic and mitochondrial NAD(P)H pools by transferring reducing equivalents across membranes. Among these, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle (GPSh) connects glycolysis with mitochondrial oxygen consumption, regenerating cytosolic NAD+ while transferring electrons into the electron transport system. Although GPSh ensures continuous glycolytic flux, its lower energy yield may favor heat dissipation over ATP synthesis. In the present work, we investigated how substrate utilization shapes respiratory capacity, energy coupling, and thermogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster flight muscle using high-resolution respirometry and chip calorimetry. G3P supported markedly higher proton leak respiration than complex I substrates, but showed much lower respiratory control ratios, indicating weak energy coupling to ATP synthesis. The mG3PDH inhibitor iGP1 almost completely abolished G3P-dependent respiration (>98%), confirming the pathway specificity. Calorimetric assays revealed that G3P oxidation generated significantly more heat than complex I substrates, demonstrating its high thermogenic potential. When glucose was supplied to intact flight muscles, inhibition of the GPSh with iGP1 decreased heat generation by ~85%, highlighting its importance for cytosolic NAD+; turnover and glycolytic flux. In summary, GPSh serves as a key mechanism for sustaining NAD+ regeneration in glycolysis but operates with low energy efficiency, leading to increased heat production in highly metabolically active tissues such as insect flight muscle.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Y.; Joseph, S.", "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are essential regulators of post-transcriptional gene expression, influencing mRNA processing, translation, and stability. Defining their binding sites on RNA is key to understanding how they assemble into functional ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, but existing footprinting and crosslinking approaches often yield low signal-to-noise, variable efficiency, or require highly purified complexes. To address these limitations, we developed Tethered Micrococcal Nuclease Mapping (TM-map), a sequencing-based strategy that determines the three-dimensional binding sites of RBPs on RNA. In TM-map, the RBP is fused to micrococcal nuclease (MNase), which upon Calcium activation cleaves proximal RNA regions, producing fragments whose 3 prime termini report the spatial proximity of the fusion. We first validated TM-map using the bacteriophage MS2 coat protein bound to its cognate RNA stem-loop engineered into the Escherichia coli ribosome. Cleavage sites mapped within ~15 angstroms of the stem-loop, confirming that tethered MNase accurately reports local structure on the ribosome surface. We then applied TM-map to the Drosophila Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP), a translational regulator with an unresolved ribosome-binding site. Both N- and C-terminal MNase-FMRP fusions produced reproducible cleavage clusters on the 18S rRNA localized to the body and head of the 40S subunit. The similar profiles suggest that FMRP's termini are conformationally flexible and sample multiple orientations relative to the ribosome, consistent with a dynamic interaction rather than a fixed binding mode. TM-map thus provides a simple, high-resolution, and generalizable approach for visualizing RBP-RNA interactions within native RNP assemblies.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Aberrant expression of the HERV-K envelope glycoprotein (Env) has been associated with cancer and neurodegeneration. Autoantibodies against HERV-K Env have been found in patients with various autoimmune diseases. Here, we report the crystal structures of the Env surface subunit (SU) from HERV-K HML-2, determined at 2.25 Angstroms resolution. The overall fold is somewhat similar to Syncycin-2 SU and distantly related to HIV-1 gp120. The structure contains five disulfide bonds and four N-linked glycans, including one glycan that appears important for structural stability. Two extended loops form a surface for potential interactions with cell-surface receptors or other cellular factors.

M.; Piontkivska, H.", "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations even among individuals with similar demographics. Disease severity has been linked with viral recognition- triggered expression of Interferons (IFNs) and Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Among these ISGs, ADARp150 is a member of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) enzyme family. ADARs are RNA editing enzymes that contribute to transcriptome diversity and modulate immune response during viral infections. While previous studies have identified altered ADAR expression and editing patterns during SARS-CoV-2 infection, it remains unknown whether ADAR expression and activity differ between patients with varying severities of COVID-19, specifically, in individuals who developed critical compared to non-critical COVID-19. We address this question by analyzing a publicly available, deeply sequenced whole blood RNA-seq dataset from individuals with either critical or non-critical COVID-19, matched for age, sex, and presence of comorbidities. Our results show differential expression of thousands of genes, including those involved in neutrophil degranulation, and upregulation of ADAR1 and its isoform ADARp110 in patients with critical COVID-19. We further identify global differences in the total number of edits, driven by ADAR1 and ADAR2 expression levels in critical but not in non-critical patients. ADAR activity also differed within Alu elements and in the proportion of edits with varying functional consequences. We further identified severity specific editing events, including nonsynonymous edits, within distinct biological pathways. Moreover, we identified 140 high confidence editing sites within 126 genes, that are differentially edited between the two patient groups. These genes were enriched in infectious disease, cell cycle, signal transduction, RNA and protein metabolism in addition to inflammatory pathways such as neutrophil degranulation and signaling by interleukins. Enrichment/modulation of neutrophil degranulation pathway at transcriptional and post transcriptional levels suggest the importance, complex regulation, and contribution of this pathway in COVID-19 disease severity. Finally, using a random forest classifier, we identified a set of differentially edited sites that could serve as molecular markers for COVID-19 disease severity. Together, our study demonstrates varying expression and editing patterns of ADARs between critical and non-critical patients, suggesting a potential role of ADAR editing in varying severity of COVID-19 pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Our algorithm infers atomic scattering factors directly from maps of the electrostatic potential determined by cryo-EM single particle analysis, bypassing the need for computationally-intensive theoretical calculations.

To illustrate its broad applicability, the algorithm is also applied to a training set of publicly-available cryo-EM data.

NM2 function is tightly regulated by a structural transition between an autoinhibited monomeric (10S) conformation in which ATPase activity, actin binding, and filament assembly are coordinately suppressed and an enzymatically active, filamentous conformation. The autoinhibited conformation is critical for the spatial and temporal control of contractility in nonmuscle cells, yet structural insights into the 10S conformation remain largely elusive. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of full-length human NM2B in the 10S conformation at ~5.24 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals a tri-segmented tail fold that introduces asymmetric interactions between both myosin heavy chains and associated light chains and the sequestration of key interfaces required for actin binding and filament assembly.

This leads to neuronal mimicry, with stromal barrier formation underpinned by coordinated transient bursts of intracellular calcium release, similar to those observed in neuronal tissue. Blockade of calcium release through either pharmacological or molecular interventions, such as STC2 depletion, prevents CAF alignment and the build-up of CD8+ T cells at stromal boundaries.

L.; Giannone, R. J.; Trinh, C. T.", "abstract": "The coexistence of bacteria and phages is marked by dynamic interactions that determine infection outcomes. However, the mechanisms by which the host allocates its resources to cope with phage infection remain largely unknown. In this study, using longitudinal proteomics, we elucidated these interactions for the temperate staphylococcal phage {phi}NM1 and strains of Staphylococcus aureus either harboring its cognate prophage or lacking it. We demonstrated that infection of non-lysogenic S. aureus with {phi}NM1 induces a dramatic shutdown of host translation, reducing proteome allocation by over 20%. Quantitative analysis of the economics of {phi}NM1 infection revealed that the diversion of these cellular resources toward phage replication imposes a significant metabolic burden, thereby impairing cell growth. In contrast, lysogenic cells cope with phage infection and prevent culture collapse through a coordinated response of prophage-encoded defenses, host-encoded stress effectors, and reprogrammed cellular metabolism, thereby avoiding translation shutdown. Through coinfection with the wildtype phage and an engineered phage-like particle carrying a CRISPR-Cas phagemid, we revealed that synthetic DNA cargos evade host defenses and hijack the transcriptional machinery, altering infection outcomes. Without immunity, coinfection could collapse the non-lysogens more quickly than the native phage by overexpressing the cargo proteins, suppressing carbohydrate metabolism, and accelerating structural phage protein production through increased phage genome replication. Together, these findings provide a systems-level understanding of phage infection in S. aureus, uncovering the mechanisms for host takeover and prophage-mediated defense, with implications for next-generation phage therapy.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

This parasite attacks the small intestine, and the main symptom is a watery diarrhoea that can be particularly severe in newborns and deadly in immunodeficient subjects. Rhomboids are ubiquitous proteases embedded in cell membranes that act by cleaving other membrane proteins in or near their transmembrane domains. Apicomplexan rhomboids play an important role in approaching and invading the host cell. This study analysed the phylogenetic origin, the structural motifs and the subcellular localization of C. parvum rhomboids. Altogether, C. parvum possesses three rhomboids, namely CpRom1, CpRom2 and CpRom3. The similarity search in Cryptosporidium genus revealed that C. parvum as well as other intestinal species lacks a PARL-like rhomboid whereas this type of mitochondrial rhomboid was present in gastric species like Cryptosporidium muris and Cryptosporidium andersoni. At the genome level this was revealed by a precise excision of the PARL-like gene in intestinal species whereas the rest of chromosomal synteny was well conserved among the Cryptosporidium species. The analysis of the structural domains revealed that C. parvum rhomboids can be classified as mixed secretases and the comparison with orthologs from Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum showed that C. parvum rhomboids can be distinguished in two separate clusters based on similarities at the level of the catalytic sites. The three rhomboids were expressed simultaneously in the invasive stage of sporozoite, but each of them had a different spatial distribution. Indeed, CpRom1 had a dual localization: this rhomboid was internal at the apical complex, and it was also accumulated at the posterior pole of the sporozoite. Otherwise, CpRom2 was prevalently contained in the apical complex, and a point of accumulation was on the surface of the apical end. Differently from CpRom1 and CpRom2, CpRom3 is distributed along the entire surface of sporozoites. Finally, we listed 10 membrane proteins as candidate substrates for the C. parvum rhomboids based on the similarities with some proven substrates of apicomplexan rhomboids and the copresence in subcellular structures with the three rhomboids.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

This challenge is especially prominent for small transcriptionally active proteins where the protein cistrome is vital for correct localization and function. Here, we have developed a photoproximity labeling method that is localized to a short 6 amino acid peptide sequence that employs the combination of the Tsien tetracysteine tag with FlAsH dye for localized singlet oxygen generation that we term FlAsH-ID. We demonstrate this method is non toxic and can be employed to label several cellular compartments, and generate high quality interactomics data around H3.1. Furthermore, we show that FlAsH-ID can be used to probe dynamic chnages in protein movement in response to immune stimuli, identifying several RNA-binding protiens that are trafficked to the nucleus following poly(I:C) treatment.

Loss of {beta}-catenin disrupts astral microtubule anchorage and impairs the localization of LGN-NuMA spindle orientation machinery.

Despite the fact that these chromosomes seem to be highly conserved in these clades, we know very little about their evolution. Part of the reason for this is that GRCs are difficult to study genomically, as they are restricted to a small subset of cells (i.e. the germline) early in development and so require germ tissue dissection in order to sequence. We have produced chromosome-scale genome assemblies including germline restricted chromosomes in three fly species (Sciaridae); Bradysia coprophila, B. impatiens, and Lycoriella ingenua. We compare the GRCs both between and within species and find that these chromosomes evolve in an extraordinarily dynamic fashion, with very little conservation of synteny or gene content. This is also true for the two species, B. coprophila and L. ingenua, that carry two of these chromosomes in their germline; the two GRCs within a species, which were thought to be homologous, are actually extremely divergent.

We conducted a comprehensive benchmarking of genomic (SNP), phenomic (FT-NIR), and metabolomic (untargeted LC-MS) prediction models across multiple traits in a biparental grapevine population phenotyped over three years. Seven statistical frameworks and four tissue x timepoint strategies (wood; vineyard leaves at budbreak and flowering; greenhouse leaves at flowering) were assessed for predictive performance. Cross-year and cross-population scenarios, involving two additional biparental populations, evaluated model robustness and transferability. Genomic prediction consistently yielded the highest accuracies (up to r = 0.80), with rrBLUP outperforming other models. Metabolomic models achieved intermediate accuracies and, in some cases matched genomic predictions, while phenomic models, though less accurate, provided a cost-effective option for early selection. Heritability analyses showed that metabolomic features were more genetically determined than NIR traits, which were highly sensitive to environmental variation. Integrating omic layers led to limited improvement, except in a few traits where genomic-metabolomic models provided modest gains. Prediction accuracy declined in across-population transfers, underscoring the importance of genetic relatedness. We propose a tiered selection strategy combining low-cost phenomic or metabolomic pre-screening under controlled conditions with genomic selection in advanced lines to accelerate the development of resilient grapevine cultivars.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Yet, conventional metagenomic sequencing often yields too few on-target reads to move beyond species-level identification. We developed a target-enriched (TE) metagenomic workflow, including bait design, an optimized TE shotgun protocol, and the VARIANT++ pipeline, to recover and classify reads at a clustered genomic sequence-variant (GSV) level (see Graphical abstract). The computational component clusters reference genomes by average nucleotide identity, builds a GSV database, and integrates Kraken2, Themisto, and mSWEEP to increase call confidence while reducing false positives. Using Mannheimia haemolytica (Mh), the primary cause of bovine respiratory disease, we designed 114,375 DNA baits targeting sequences across 70 reference genomes. TE libraries from nasopharyngeal swabs of feedlot cattle achieved >250-fold increases in on-target Mh reads (~2.5% of non-host reads on average) compared with conventional shotgun sequencing, despite using one-quarter the sequencing depth. This variant-level resolution revealed six GSVs; most samples contained at least two, indicating variant mixtures difficult to detect with culture- or shotgun-based surveys. Because the approach leverages available reference sequences, it can be reconfigured for other microbial targets.

Treated groups received oral administration of aqueous lemongrass extract at a dose of 400 mg/kg body weight daily for 21 days. Biochemical studies measured body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, and pancreatic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Relative to the normal control (NC) rats, the extract caused a significant decrease (P < 0.05) in final blood glucose in normal treated (NT) rats. STZ injection resulted in a significant increase (P < 0.05) in FBG in diabetic control (DC) rats compared to NC rats. However, FBG in diabetic treated (DT) rats was not statistically different (P > 0.05) compared to DC rats.

While AAVs have a strong safety profile, recent studies show that AAV causes dendritic loss and synaptic weakening in mouse somatosensory cortex, impacts that are prevented by systemic administration of blockers of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), an innate immunoreceptor that detects unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs. However, TLR9 blockers are immunosuppressive and costly. To realize AAV's full potential, it is critical to identify strategies to protect neurons without compromising immunity. Here we find that partially depleting CpG motifs from the AAV genome prevents AAV-induced dendritic loss and synaptic weakening. CpG depletion of transgene and intronic regions via codon-optimized synonymous mutations was protective and did not impair transgene expression in vivo. To facilitate the production and use of lower-CpG AAVs, we created a web-facing application, CpG-Assist Tool (CpG-AT), which allows researchers to quantify the CpG content of any sequence, explore the CpG content of commonly used AAV components, and generate CpG-depleted coding and non-coding sequences.

In this study, we examine the role of cardiac Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome candidate 2 (Whsc2), also known as Negative elongation factor A (NELFA), one of the genes encoded in the WHS critical region. The Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome is a contiguous genetic disorder due to microdeletions in the critical region, with clinical manifestations of neurological defects frequently associated with congenital malformations, including cardiac defects. NelfA has been implicated in RNA polymerase II (pol II) pausing, suggesting a role in pol II-dependent gene transcription. We previously reported an early onset of heart failure with the acute knockdown of NelfA in hearts undergoing pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Here, we characterize a mouse model with cardiomyocyte-specific loss of NelfA function, in which these mice develop spontaneous cardiomyopathy at 2 months of age and exhibit early mortality by 3 months, suggesting a critical role for postnatal NelfA in the heart. Interactome data show that chromatin-bound NelfA interacts with proteins involved in chromatin remodeling (Trim28) and pre-mRNA processing (Adrph1l), along with expected binding partners like RNA pol II, Supt5, and other Nelf proteins. Examination of genomic occupancy of these NelfA-associated proteins in the NelfA knockout (KO) hearts reveals a disassembly of the NelfA nucleated complex at promoters of cardiac-enriched genes, including cytoskeletal and metabolic genes. This deconstruction of the NelfA-dependent complex results in the inhibited expression of these essential genes during postnatal cardiac development, leading to a cardiac contractile and metabolic crisis that precipitates dilated cardiomyopathy.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

IOP is regulated by segmental, flow-dependent responses of the inner-wall endothelium of Schlemm's canal (SC), and dysfunction of this system contributes to ocular hypertension and glaucoma. Here, we identify a cell-autonomous PIEZO1-ANGPT2-integrin alpha9 (ITGA9)-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) mechanotransduction pathway that enables SC endothelial cells to respond to pressure and flow stimuli to maintain IOP homeostasis. Pharmacological activation of the mechanosensitive ion channel PIEZO1 with Yoda1 enhanced ITGA9 accumulation at cell-cell junctions in vitro and induced FAK phosphorylation in an ITGA9- and ANGPT2-dependent manner. In vivo in SC, PIEZO1 activation reduced intracellular ANGPT2, increased junctional ITGA9, and was associated with phosphorylation of FAK and the ANGPT receptor TIE2 (encoded by TEK). Endothelial-specific deletion of Piezo1 or inducible knockout of Itga9 in mice resulted in SC narrowing, elevated IOP, and peripheral retinal ganglion cell loss; double heterozygotes exhibited more severe phenotypes than either single heterozygote, consistent with functional interaction within a single pathway. Moreover, in eyes from Piezo1 and Itga9 mutants, endothelial cell proliferation was reduced, and similar findings have been reported in Angpt2 mutants, supporting a model in which the autocrine flow-PIEZO1-ANGPT2-ITGA9 axis links mechanical stimuli to structural adaptation of SC.

A bistability in these fate-setting structures establishes pattern length scale and is sufficient to break symmetry in the mesenchyme. However, an adjacent epithelium, through signals like Wnt, can locally seed the bistability to ensure the epithelial-adjacency of soft tissue. Rather than acting in a graded manner to provide positional information, Wnt affects cell fate by promoting a supracellular structure.

Algal blooms with dense chlorophyll occurred consistently at high concentrations of the petroleum-derived thermoplastic polyurethane, but only occasionally with the two bioplastics. Herbivorous zooplankton density was strongly reduced by typical thermoplastic polyurethane and only weakly by bioplastics, therefore the effect on algae is at least partly due to reductions in top-down grazing pressure. Microbial communities exhibited compositional shifts in response to all three plastic types, with petroleum-derived plastic associated with the most pronounced differences across both prokaryotic and eukaryotic domains.

This adaptive response is driven in part by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which mitigates ASNase-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS-mediated DNA damage, enabling tumor cell survival under therapeutic pressure. ASNase-treated malignant B cells exhibit features of replication stress, with activation of the ATR-dependent DNA damage response and increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2 (PARP) activity.

Results KO SG mice exhibited delayed glucose utilization after an oral challenge and progressive loss of insulin sensitivity, despite the same magnitude of surgery-induced weight change between the two genotypes. WAT in KO SG mice had lower mass, smaller adipocytes and increased inflammation. SG had a differential effect on colonic levels of the glucoregulatory cholic acid 7-sulfate (CA7S): increasing CA7S concentration in the WT mice but decreasing it in the KO mice.

Conclusion VDR is necessary for metabolic health after SG in DIO mice due to its role in WAT function, insulin sensitivity and inflammatory response after surgery. Increased expression of VDR in patients post-MBS suggests that it may also contribute to metabolic responses in humans.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Central nervous system development requires parallel but interrelated processes of neural circuit assembly and vascularization. Intersecting between these two processes, the cell-adhesion G-protein coupled receptor Adgrl2 is expressed in select neuron populations where it has been found to localize and control the assembly of specific synaptic sites. Further, Adgrl2 is found to be expressed in select non-neuronal brain cells, where it is restricted to endothelial cells. Testing for Adgrl2 function in these cells, here we find that endothelial cell specific Adgrl2 deletion results in an impairment in cerebrovascular integrity. To understand how it might be possible for Adgrl2 to function independently in neuronal and endothelial contexts, we analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing datasets for differences in transcriptional identity between these cell classes. Doing so, we find that expression of Adgrl2 mRNA is subject to robust cell type-specific alternative splicing, resulting in distinct isoforms being produced in neurons compared to endothelial cells. Investigating the functional implication of this cell type-specific alternative splicing, we find that forced expression of the neuronal isoform of Adgrl2 in endothelial cells leads to alterations in cerebrovasculature properties. Morphologically, endothelial cells with the non-native neuronal Adgrl2 isoform induce the formation of ectopic glutamatergic synaptic contacts onto endothelial cells, indicating alternations in the cell-cell recognition process. Functionally, in direct contrast to endothelial Adgrl2 deletion, this genetic expression switch instead enhances blood brain barrier integrity. This overly restricted cerebrovascular function results in dysregulation of blood to cerebrospinal fluid homeostasis, enlargement of brain ventricles, and a higher likelihood in the development of hydrocephalus neurological disorder. As such, alternative splicing serves as a cell type specific mechanism that provides isoform specific Adgrl2 for discerning functions controlling neural circuit assembly and cerebrovascular homeostasis.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

G.; Colgin, L. L.", "abstract": "The dentate gyrus (DG) is thought to play a key role in the formation of dissociable memory representations for similar contexts. Neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) receive highly processed spatial and nonspatial sensory information from the medial and lateral entorhinal cortices, respectively. Changes in spatially tuned firing patterns of DG place cells occur after spatial changes to an environment, but the degree to which DG place cells respond to ethologically relevant nonspatial stimuli is largely unknown. Spatial and nonspatial information is thought to be transmitted to the DG during discrete local field potential events called dentate spikes. Here, we tested the extent to which different spatial and nonspatial stimuli modulate place cell firing patterns and dentate spike dynamics. We performed extracellular recordings of DG place cells and local field potentials in rats of both sexes exploring a familiar spatial environment, in which social stimuli and nonsocial odors of varying ethological relevance were presented, and a novel spatial environment. As expected, DG place cells exhibited different firing patterns between familiar and novel environments. Remarkably, a small population of DG place cells changed their firing patterns when social but not nonsocial stimuli were presented in a familiar environment. Additionally, the occurrence of dentate spikes associated with lateral entorhinal cortex inputs increased during exploration of social but not nonsocial stimuli. Altogether, these results suggest that the DG preferentially responds to social stimuli at neuronal and network levels, providing novel insights into how spatial and nonspatial information is integrated in the DG.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Using the CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenic system we selected founder fish lines harbouring frameshift mutations in both genes and bred these together to generate a double stmn2a and stmn2b KO model. Using these models, we observed increased developmental lethality in our double stmn2a and stmn2b KO model and impaired motor function at larval stages of development. Examination of the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) revealed a slight increase in the number of orphaned NMJs in trunk musculature as well as a reduction in amplitude of miniature endplate currents in our double stmn2a and stmn2b KO model. In a final series of experiments, we show impaired ventral root axon regrowth following transection in double stmn2a and stmn2b KO larvae. Our findings suggest that while not essential for motor axon development, loss of stmn2a and stmn2b expression perturbs the assembly of zebrafish NMJs during development resulting in a minor motor phenotype and impairs that ability to regenerate motor axons following injury.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Although IFN-gamma; activates both STAT1 and STAT3, how these pathways interact to regulate immune evasion under hypoxia remains unclear. Methods: Using the MC38 murine colorectal cancer model and T cell-tumor spheroid co-culture assays, we examined how IFN-gamma; signaling through STAT1 and STAT3 influences PD-L1 expression, CSC plasticity, and cytotoxic T cell function under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Pharmacologic inhibitors and siRNA knockdown were used to dissect pathway function, and Niclosamide, an FDA-approved anthelmintic, was evaluated as a dual STAT1/STAT3 inhibitor. Results: We found that IFN-gamma; primarily induced PD-L1 through STAT1 activation, while CSC plasticity was associated with STAT3 signaling. STAT1 and STAT3 displayed reciprocal regulation-blocking one enhanced activation of the other. Niclosamide effectively inhibited phosphorylation of both STAT1 and STAT3, which led to suppressed PD-L1 upregulation and reduced CSC enrichment. In addition, it also partially inhibited hypoxia-induced HIF-1alpha; expression. In co-culture assays, Niclosamide improved T cell infiltration and reduced exhaustion under hypoxic conditions, resulting in improved T cell killing. Conclusions: Our findings identified Niclosamide as a potent dual STAT1/3 inhibitor capable of reversing IFN-gamma; and hypoxia-driven immune evasion.

Understanding how these drugs facilitate bacterial killing has important implications for identifying novel therapeutic targets and optimizing drug combinations. Previous studies on mycobacteria using the BacTiter-Glo luminescence assay have reported increased ATP levels after treatment with cell wall inhibitors such as isoniazid, a phenomenon referred to as an ATP burst. This phenomenon has been proposed to contribute to drug-induced killing. In this study, we demonstrate that the ATP burst is not a biological response but rather an experimental artifact resulting from enhanced cell lysis induced by cell wall-targeting drugs. The addition of a bead-beating lysis step prior to luminescence measurement abolishes the ATP burst, enabling a more reliable assessment of intracellular ATP levels with this assay. Our findings thus establish a direct link between the ATP burst and the canonical mechanism of action of cell wall inhibitors. We further demonstrate the utility of this approach as a functional readout for identifying compounds that disrupt the mycobacterial cell wall and for screening synergistic or antagonistic interactions with known cell wall-targeting agents.

Single-cell analyses established a direct link between thiol oxidation and drug survival, indicating that redox imbalance drives persistence. Whereas depletion of coenzyme A (CoA), a central thiol-containing metabolite, scaled with tolerance, restoring CoA using engineered catalysts from Staphylococcus aureus abolished tolerance, establishing a causal relation between CoA availability and drug susceptibility.

However, their widespread use has led to decreased efficacy due to intrinsic or acquired resistance. FQs exhibit antimicrobial activity by stabilizing type II topoisomerases-generated DNA breaks, thereby inducing lethal double-strand breaks (DSBs) and leading to bacterial death. Escalating resistance among mycobacterial pathogens highlights the need to elucidate resistance mechanisms and identify novel strategies to restore or enhance the drug activity. Here, we revealed homologous recombination (HR) as a key determinant of FQ tolerance in Mycobacterium abscessus, a notoriously drug-resistant pathogen. Through a transposon mutagenesis screen, we identified that disruption of adnB - an HR-associated gene, markedly sensitized M. abscessus to FQs. This finding prompted a systematic dissection of DSB repair pathways in M. abscessus. Targeted deletion of HR core components (adnB, recO, recA, recR, ruvB) significantly increased FQ susceptibility in vitro, while inactivation of alternative DSB repair pathways - single-strand annealing (SSA) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) - had no effect, revealing a unique reliance on HR for FQ tolerance. Furthermore, the complementation of gene knock-out M. abscessus strains {Delta}adnB, {Delta}recO, {Delta}recA, {Delta}recR or {Delta}ruvB with the corresponding genes from M. abscessus, as well as homologous genes from Mycobacterium tuberculosis restored the resistance phenotype, indicating a conserved HR-dependent tolerance mechanism in M. abscessuss. In a murine infection model, genetic abrogation of HR significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy of FQs against M. abscessus, demonstrating translational relevance. Collectively, our findings position HR as a conserved and actionable vulnerability in M. abscessus, and provide a compelling rationale for developing HR-targeted adjuvant therapies to resensitize drug-refractory strains to FQ treatment.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

During infection by non-segmented negative-sense viruses, viral entry into cells recruits the large ribosomal subunit protein rpL40 to a noncanonical site on the small subunit of 80S ribosomes near the mRNA entry site. These specialized ribosomes preferentially bind viral mRNAs to drive enhanced viral protein synthesis that is critical for replication under host pressures. Unexpectedly, we find that viruses have co-opted this translation pathway from a previously unrecognized endogenous ribosome remodeling program in which metabolic stress alters ribosome structure to promote mRNA translation required for cell survival.

M.; Burgos-Andrade, K.; Escares-Aguilera, V.; Gutierrez, B.; Valdivia, N.", "abstract": "Balancing sample sizes between infected and uninfected hosts is a common challenge in ecological parasitology, particularly when dealing with intermediate hosts involved in complex life cycles. In these life cycles, common in nature, the intermediate hosts accumulate parasites across their ontogeny, making it difficult to obtain similar numbers of naturally infected and uninfected individuals across full host body-size spectra. Here, we present a standardized and repeatable method to experimentally infect and re-infect intermediate hosts using parasite eggs derived directly from the fresh faeces of definitive hosts. We tested this methodology in a marine host-parasite system involving the acanthocephalan Profilicollis altmani, the mole crab Emerita analoga, and the grey gull Leucophaeus modestus. Crabs were raised in controlled laboratory conditions from early juvenile stages, ensuring no prior infections, and exposed to parasite eggs through filtered faecal suspensions. Larval development was tracked across two inoculation events. The first larval stage (acanthellae) appeared six days after inoculation and matured into cystacanths within the following week. After the first exposure, 55% of inoculated hosts were infected; after the second, infection prevalence reached 100%. Larger crabs acquired more parasites than smaller ones, likely due to higher filtration rates. The method closely mimics natural faecal-oral transmission while avoiding the need to isolate or handle parasite eggs directly. It also overcomes the common issue of parasite overdispersion in natural populations by enabling controlled infections across host size classes and experimental replicates. This technique is particularly useful in species with opaque cuticles, where internal parasites cannot be visually identified in vivo. Additionally, it can be extended beyond acanthocephalans to other helminth taxa (e.g., nematodes, cestodes, and digeneans) whose eggs are also shed in vertebrate faeces.

This study addresses this methodological gap by developing and applying a dual-source bibliometric framework to the interdisciplinary field of medical genomics data science, aiming to map its complete knowledge lifecycle. Methods: We analyzed two corpora from 2015 to late 2025; academic literature from Dimensions (n=825 publications) and practical challenges from Kaggle (n=15 competitions). The analysis employed co-authorship, co-citation, and keyword co-occurrence network analysis to map social and intellectual structures. Science mapping techniques, including LDA-based thematic analysis with a strategic diagram (Callon's map) and Kleinberg's burst detection algorithm, were used to model the field's evolution and identify emerging research fronts. Results: Publication growth follows a logistic (S-shaped) model (AIC=60.35, R2=0.998), indicating field maturation. The co-authorship network exhibits a high average clustering coefficient (0.946), confirming a \"small-world\" structure. Thematic analysis identified 10 distinct topics, with \"Core Machine Learning Models\" acting as the primary motor theme. A key integrative finding is a measurable diffusion lag for novel architectures like Transformers, where their popularization on Kaggle precedes widespread academic adoption (p<0.05 in lead-lag analysis). Furthermore, open data sharing was found to have a statistically significant positive effect on citation impact (p=0.047).

Centric diatoms showed lineage-specific expansion of flotation-associated microtubule genes, while pennate diatoms expanded motility-related actin and myosin genes. At the intra-species level, distinct Phaeodactylum tricornutum strains revealed genomic adaptations correlated with their unique features, including strain-specific expansion and contraction in the cruciform strain's morphological genes and the Baltic Sea isolate's amine metabolism genes. Our estimates of major lineage divergence times in diatoms (~202 Ma and ~173 Ma) were highly consistent with the two deep WGD events (~200 Ma and ~170 Ma). At these evolutionary nodes, gene families showed extensive lineage-specific expansions and contractions, likely linking ancient polyploidy to subsequent gene content evolution. Substantial TE expansions occurred more recently (0.5-5 Ma), with most diatoms showing recent bursts of Long Terminal Repeat Retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) and araphid pennate diatoms displaying more ancient TE insertion peaks. This likely reflects the progressive loss of ancient TE copies, leaving only recent TE insertions detectable.

Current dogma holds that collective and mesenchymal invasion programs trigger the mobilization of proteinases that digest structural barriers dominated by type I collagen, while amoeboid activity allows cancer cells to marshal mechanical forces to traverse tissues independently of ECM proteolysis. Here, we use cancer spheroid-3-dimensional matrix models, single-cell RNA sequencing, and human tissue explants to identify the mechanisms controlling mesenchymal versus amoeboid invasion. Unexpectedly, collective/mesenchymal- and amoeboid-type invasion programs, though distinct, are each characterized by active tunneling through ECM barriers, with expression of matrix-degradative metalloproteinases. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeting of a single membrane-anchored collagenase, MMP14/MT1-MMP, ablates tissue-invasive activity while co-regulating cancer cell transcriptional programs. Though changes in matrix architecture, nuclear rigidity, and metabolic stress as well as the presence of cancer-associated fibroblasts are proposed to support amoeboid activity, none of these changes restore invasive activity of MMP14-targeted cancer cells. While a requirement for MMP14 is bypassed in low-density collagen hydrogels, invasion by the proteinase-deleted cells is associated with nuclear envelope and DNA damage, highlighting a proteolytic requirement for maintaining nuclear integrity. Nevertheless, when cancer cells confront explants of live human breast tissue, MMP14 is again required to support invasive activity.

Despite the frequent use of traditional reference genes for gene expression normalization by RT qPCR, their stability can vary across genotypes and stress conditions. Here, we evaluated the stability of seven commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, SAMDC, UBQ, 25S rRNA, TUB, SARMp1, and ACAD) and two additional candidates (EF5A 1 and SDH1 1) identified from RNA-Seq data in two contrasting energy cane genotypes (Vertix 1, smut-susceptible; Vertix 2, smut-resistant). Stability was assessed at three infection time points (12 hours post inoculation, 48 hpi, and 5 days post inoculation) separately and also on a combined dataset comprising all time points, under mock and smut inoculated conditions. Gene stability, evaluated through multiple approaches (coefficient of variation, RefFinder, GeNorm) and consolidated using RankAggreg, revealed genotype and condition dependent variability, with no universal reference gene set for most conditions. GAPDH, commonly used in sugarcane studies, showed the highest variation in our experiments, reinforcing the need for genotype and condition specific validation. The best ranked reference genes were used to quantify ROS related defense responses. Vertix 2 (Vx2) exhibited coordinated induction of SOD, POX5, and CATB, whereas Vertix 1 (Vx1) showed delayed or reduced activation of these genes alongside a compensatory up regulation of GSTt3. By validating reliable endogenous genes from literature and RNA Seq data, this study ensures accurate gene expression quantification under biotic stress and highlights antioxidant mechanisms as contributors to smut resistance in S. scitamineum energy cane interactions.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

However, developmental relationships between DA, neurocognitive control, and the emergence of substance use are poorly understood. Here, we tested the role of basal ganglia tissue iron, reflecting DA neurophysiology, as well as impulsivity and inhibitory control in longitudinal developmental trajectories of substance use. We leveraged the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence and Adulthood (NCANDA-A) cohort, a large, multisite longitudinal neuroimaging study of 807 participants (baseline ages 12-22 years old, 50% female, 1-9 annual visits per participant, 6164 sessions total). Substance use, inhibitory control, and tissue iron increased non-linearly during adolescence into young adulthood, concurrent with decreases in impulsivity. Non-linear Growth Mixture Models identified four common trajectories of substance use: low (no- or low levels of use across visits; 30% of participants), youth peak (peak use in adolescence/young adulthood followed by declines; 26%), adolescent increasing (early, steep linear increases in use from adolescence into adulthood; 17%), and adult increasing (low use in adolescence, followed by late linear increases into adulthood; 26%). We show that increased substance use was associated with a phenotype of high impulsivity, low inhibitory control, and low basal ganglia tissue iron, particularly in early adolescence in individuals who displayed youth peak patterns in substance use trajectories. These findings highlight that early developmental differences in DA-related neurobiology and associated impulsivity and cognitive control shape distinct trajectories of adolescent substance use, underscoring adolescence as a critical window for the early identification and implementation of neurodevelopmentally sensitive interventions for substance use disorders.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

We systematically study the activity of RNNs with random weights drawn from biologically plausible Levy alpha-stable distributions. While mean-field theory for the infinite system predicts that the quiescent state is always unstable---implying ubiquitous chaos---our finite-size analysis reveals a sharp transition between quiescent and chaotic dynamics. We theoretically predict the gain at which the finite system transitions from quiescent to chaotic dynamics, and validate it through simulations. Compared to Gaussian networks, finite heavy-tailed RNNs exhibit a broader gain regime near the edge of chaos, namely, a slow transition to chaos. However, this robustness comes with a tradeoff: heavier tails reduce the Lyapunov dimension of the attractor, indicating lower effective dimensionality. Our results reveal a biologically aligned tradeoff between the robustness of dynamics near the edge of chaos and the richness of high-dimensional neural activity. By analytically characterizing the transition point in finite-size networks---where mean-field theory breaks down---we provide a tractable framework for understanding dynamics in realistically sized, heavy-tailed neural circuits.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Although Caulobacter is widespread and has long served as a model for the study of bacterial cell biology, our understanding of the diversity of viruses that infect Caulobacter species is limited. Here, we describe the discovery and characterization of Circe, a freshwater N4-like podophage belonging to the Schitoviridae family that infects C. crescentus. We isolated two variants, CirceC and CirceH, that differ by a single nucleotide resulting in an F91I substitution in Gp063, an uncharacterized protein found in diverse bacteriophages and bacteria. While both Circe variants adsorb to C. crescentus with similar efficiency, they produce morphologically distinct plaques and display different infection dynamics. Through forward genetic selection and genome-wide transposon fitness profiling, we identified C. crescentus genes involved in cell envelope assembly, membrane sphingolipid biosynthesis, and envelope polysaccharide biosynthesis that influence susceptibility to Circe infection. Loss-of-function mutations in a predicted nucleoside diphosphate sugar epimerase and multiple genes required for smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS) biosynthesis and export conferred strong resistance to infection. These results support a model in which S-LPS functions as a receptor for phage Circe. Our study expands the known repertoire of Caulobacter phages and adds to a growing understanding of the role of envelope polysaccharides in bacterial infection by N4-family phages.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

J.; Yla\u0308nne, J.", "abstract": "Mechanosensing involves proteins detecting mechanical changes in the cytoskeleton or at cell adhesion sites. These interactions initiate signaling cascades that produce biochemical effects such as post-translational modifications or cytoskeletal rearrangements. Filamin is a ubiquitous mechanosensing protein that binds actin filaments and senses pulling forces within the cytoskeleton. Drosophila Filamin (Cheerio) is structurally similar to mammalian Filamin, with roles in egg chamber development, embryo cellularization, and integrity of muscle attachment sites and Z discs in Drosophila indirect flight muscles (IFMs). Here we report a potential novel mechanotransduction pathway involving Filamin and Drak, a death-associated protein kinase that functions as a myosin light chain kinase. We found that Drak biochemically binds mechanically activated Filamin. During embryo cellularization, Drak-GFP localization followed that of Filamin and myosin at the initiation of the cellularization furrow. During indirect flight muscle development at the pupal stage, Drak was expressed in the tendon cells and in the developing myotubes. Drak co-localized with Filamin in the tendon cells at the time of myotube attachment site maturation and Drak expression peaked in the myotubes at the compaction stage. Drak null mutant and a Filamin mutant with reduced Drak binding caused an epistatic effect on the adult muscle attachment site morphology. These results suggest that Filamin may have a role in the regulation of Drak function in response to mechanical forces.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

M.; Van Doren, E.; Kirshen, K.; Keles, E.; Avalos, K.; Khetani, R. S.; Rosen, V.", "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a chronic age-related condition in which imbalanced activities between bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts lead to the progressive loss of bone volume and quality. While drugs that target osteoclastic activity have been developed, there remains a lack of efficient therapies that increase osteoblast number and function in aging bones. Here, we investigated if Activin, known to increase in the circulation with age, plays a primary role in bone loss associated with aging. We showed that, in mouse femurs, levels of Activin signaling progressively increased with age and strongly correlated with the loss of trabecular bone. Furthermore, mice lacking the type I receptor for Activin, namely Alk4, in osteoblast progenitors (Alk4 cKO mice) had increased trabecular bone acquisition, osteoblast number, and bone formation rate. In addition, Alk4 cKO male mice were protected against early age-related trabecular bone loss observed at 1 year of age. These results indicate that Activin signaling inhibits bone formation and osteoblast activity and is likely associated with osteoporosis. To further test this, we injected 2-year-old male mice with a ligand trap (Alk4-Fc) to capture circulating Activin. Alk4-Fc protected against loss of trabecular bone in femurs and L5 vertebrae. Interestingly, Alk4-Fc also prevented a decrease in muscle mass in gastrocnemius, quadriceps, and triceps suggesting that circulating Activins also play a role in sarcopenia. In summary, our preclinical mouse models reveal that circulating Activins play a primary role in age-related bone loss and can be efficiently targeted to alleviate osteoporosis and sarcopenia in aging mice.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

V.; de Lange, F.", "abstract": "Humans make over a hundred thousand eye movements daily to gather visual information. But what determines where we look? Current computational models typically link gaze behaviour to visual features of isolated images, but we know that eye movements are also strongly shaped by cognitive goals: Observers gather information that helps them to understand, rather than just represent, the world. Within this framework, observers should focus more on information that updates one's understanding of the environment, and less on what is purely visually salient. Here we tested this hypothesis using a free-viewing paradigm of narratives where we experimentally manipulated the meaningfulness of temporal context by either presenting pictures in a coherent, i.e. correct, order, or in a temporally shuffled order. We developed a novel approach to quantify which visual information is semantically salient (i.e., important for understanding): we separately obtained language narratives for images in stories, and computed the contextual surprisal of visual objects using a large language model. The ability of this semantic saliency model in explaining gaze behaviour was compared to a state-of-the art model of visual saliency (DeepGaze-II). We found that individuals looked relatively more often and more quickly at semantically salient objects when images were presented in coherent compared to shuffled order. In contrast, visual salience did not better account for gaze behaviour in coherent than shuffled order. These findings highlight how internal contextual models guide visual sampling and demonstrate that language models could offer a powerful tool for capturing gaze behavior in richer, meaningful settings.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

Technologies using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have been developed to model human brain cells with the goal to understand their function. To effectively study neuro-immune crosstalk and investigate microglial contributions to neuronal network development and function, both microglia and neurons should co-mature allowing for long-term interactions throughout their differentiation. Here, we present a co-maturation protocol that robustly generates glutamatergic neuronal networks containing human iPSC-derived microglia. We validated the long-term co-cultures using single-cell transcriptomics, imaging and neuronal activity readouts. We show that astrocytes were required for long-term survival of microglia and for their integration into neuronal networks. Our co-maturation approach induced the typical ramified microglia morphology and characteristic microglia-neuron interactions. Homeostatic markers like P2RY12 and TMEM119 and neuronal remodeling associated genes were upregulated compared to microglia monocultures, highlighting the necessity of the environment to generate and maintain the context-dependent microglia signature in vitro.

We recorded neuronal spike rates in an audio-vocal specialist, the bat Carollia perspicillata, which emits vocalizations to echolocate and for social communication. We found distinct spike patterns encoding echolocation and communication calls several hundred milliseconds before vocal onset. Neuronal activity not only contained information about the vocalization category, but also reflected temporal complexity, specifically the syllable amount in a communication sequence. These vocalization-specific firing patterns were dependent on the neuron's frequency receptive field. Our results indicate that single neurons in the auditory cortex not only process acoustic information but also encode the class and temporal structure of future vocal output.", "date": "2025-10-24", "journal": ""}

APOE3, but not APOE4 or APOEKO, astrocytes prevented cholesterol and lipid induced neurite damage in APOE4 neurons. In the media of APOE3 co-cultured astrocytes with neurons the HDL-like particles were larger and presumably more lipidated than equivalent APOE4 co-cultures.
