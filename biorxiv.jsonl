L.", "abstract": "While wetlands represent a small fraction (~5-10%) of the world's land surface, it is estimated that one-third of wetlands have been lost due to human activities. Wetland habitat loss decreases ecosystem benefits such as improving water quality and mitigating climate change. These microbially mediated functions are dependent on redox conditions, which are altered by soil hydrology and the presence of plants. In this study, we hypothesized that redox status due to continuous flooding would support greater abundance of microbial taxa involved in methanogenesis (obligate anaerobes), but plant-mediated oxygen transport would decrease methane emissions. Using a mesocosm design, we manipulated the duration of hydrologic conditions (i.e., stable dry, stable flooding, and alternating wet/dry) and presence of plants to induce soil redox changes in wetland soils. We measured soil redox status, used targeted amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to characterize microbial communities, and measured greenhouse gas production to assess microbial function. Results showed that hydrologic history influenced microbial community composition while plant presence and hydrologic treatment altered microbial functional gene composition to a lesser degree. Plant presence decreased carbon dioxide fluxes, while differences in the community composition of functional genes related to carbohydrate metabolism, denitrification, and methanogenesis also explained variation in emissions of carbon dioxide and, to a lesser extent, methane. While previous studies do not often include plants when assessing greenhouse gas emissions, this study highlights that plant-mediated decreases in greenhouse gas emissions are important, and plant-mediated effects should be considered when estimating the carbon balance of ecosystems.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

All these interactions are affected by the molecules' localization within the cell, i.e., their compartmentalization. Such, in cellula, compartment-specific dynamics is difficult to measure, because of limitations in instrumentation, autofluorescence of cells, and the necessity to track diffusing molecules. Here, we present a bottom-up engineering approach, which allows us to track transfected proteins in cellula and to analyze timeresolved single-molecule FRET efficiencies. This has been achieved by alternating laser excitation (ALEX) based three-channel (donor, acceptor and FRET) tracking with a live-cell HILO microscope. We validate our strategy by characterizing long-term static-FRET traces of customized DNA with known dye positions. We utilize two different transfection strategies, namely a biological (Streptolysin-O toxin protein) and a physical one (Microinjection). By comparing in vitro and in cellula measurements we show that the cellular environment in this case changes the FRET efficiency by about 25%. In addition, we evaluate single-molecule FRET traces for the heat shock protein Hsp90 in cellula. The obtained FRET efficiency distribution is largely consistent with known Hsp90 structures and in vitro distributions, but also shows some clear differences. Altogether, we show that FRET-TTB (Foerster Resonance Energy Transfer-Tracking of Transfected Biomolecules) opens the path to study protein state changes of transfected biomolecules in cellula, including time-resolved cellular localization.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

S.; Nag, S.; Dey, S.", "abstract": "A classic result in theoretical ecology states that an increase in the proportion of cooperative interactions in unstructured ecological communities leads to a loss of stability to external perturbations. However, the fate and composition of the species that constitute an unstable ecological community following such perturbations remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we use an individual-based model to study the population dynamics of unstructured communities following external perturbations to species abundances. We find that while increasing the number of cooperative interactions does indeed increase the probability that a community will experience an extinction following a perturbation, the entire community is rarely wiped out following a perturbation. Instead, only a subset of the ecological community is driven to extinction, and the species that go extinct are more likely to be those engaged in a greater number of competitive interactions. Thus, the resultant community formed after a perturbation has a higher proportion of cooperative interactions than the original community. We show that this result can be explained by studying the dynamics of the species engaged in the highest number of competitive interactions: After an external perturbation, those species that compete with such a 'top competitor' are more likely to go extinct than expected by chance alone, whereas those that are engaged in cooperative interactions with such a species are less likely to go extinct than expected by chance alone. Our results provide a potential explanation for the ubiquity of cooperative interactions in nature despite the known negative effects of cooperation on community stability.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

In the mammalian retina, divergence of cone signals into multiple feedforward bipolar cell pathways forms the initial basis for parallel retinal circuits dedicated to specific visual functions. Here, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology, electron microscopy and two photon imaging of a fluorescent glutamate sensor to examine how kinetically-distinct responses arise in transient versus sustained ON alpha RGCs (ON-T and ON-S RGCs) of the mouse retina. We directly compared the visual response properties of these RGCs with their presynaptic bipolar cell partners, which we identified using 3D electron microscopy reconstruction. Different ON bipolar cell subtypes (type 5i, type 6 and type 7) had indistinguishable light-driven responses whereas extracellular glutamate signals around RGC dendrites and postsynaptic excitatory currents measured in ON-T and ON-S RGCs in response to the identical stimuli used to probe bipolar cells were kinetically distinct. Anatomical examination of the bipolar cell axon terminals presynaptic to ON-T and ON-S RGCs suggests that bipolar subtype-specific differences in the size of synaptic ribbon-associated vesicle pools may contribute to transient versus sustained kinetics. Our findings indicate that feedforward bipolar cell synapses are a primary point of divergence in kinetically distinct visual pathways.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

The study included cattle of all ages and both sexes, with the aim of assessing the prevalence of bovine fasciolosis and identifying associated risk factors in Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. To detect fluke eggs, fecal tests were performed, and the data was analyzed using a descriptive statistics. The overall prevalence of fasciolosis was 49.21%.

Statistical analysis revealed significant disparities in occurrence among areas. Cattle in poor condition had the largest prevalence (64%), followed by medium condition (50%) and fat cattle (26.96%). This variation was statistically significant. Age-group analysis revealed comparable prevalence rates, with young cattle at 50.38%, adults at 47.33%, and elderly cattle at 50.47%, with no significant differences found. There were no significant sex variations in prevalence, with males exhibiting a prevalence of 49.73% and females 48.73%.

First, neuronal responses are very diverse -- specific stimuli or behaviors prompt some neurons to emit many action potentials, while other neurons remain relatively silent. Second, the trial-to-trial fluctuations of neuronal response occupy a low-dimensional space due to correlated activity across the population. We link these two aspects of population response using a randomly coupled recurrent circuit model and derive the following relation: the more diverse the firing rates of neurons in a population, the lower the effective dimension of population trial-to-trial covariability. We tested our prediction using simultaneously recorded neuronal populations from numerous brain areas in mice, non-human primates, and in the motor cortex of human participants. Surprisingly, when populations are restricted to a single brain area our result holds, but when a population is composed from neurons spanning multiple brain areas the relation breaks down. This reflects the fact that the macroscopic connectivity structure at the multi-regional level is significantly more pronounced than the local wiring within a brain area. Finally, using our result we present a theory where a more diverse neuronal code leads to better fine discrimination performance from population activity. In line with this theory, we show that neuronal populations across the brain exhibit both more diverse mean responses and lower-dimensional fluctuations when the brain is in more heightened states of information processing. In sum, we present a key organizational principle of neuronal population response that is widely observed across the nervous system and acts to synergistically improve population representation.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Most tailed phages that have been structurally characterized to date infect Gram-negative bacteria, but those targeting Gram-positive bacteria, many of which are important human pathogens, are less well understood. Here, we show that the baseplate of phage phi812, which infects Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, is formed of a core, wedge modules, and baseplate arms carrying receptor-binding proteins type 1 and 2 and tripod complexes. The baseplate of phi812 with extended tail has threefold symmetry, but after tail contraction, it transforms to sixfold symmetry. In this process, the receptor-binding proteins re-orient to bind to the host cell. The conformational changes to the tripod complexes trigger the release of the central spike and weld proteins from the baseplate, which exposes peptidoglycan-degrading domains of the hub proteins. Changes in the positions of baseplate arms are transmitted through wedge modules to tail sheath initiator proteins. The ring formed by the tail sheath initiator proteins expands in diameter and triggers the contraction of the tail sheath. The tail sheath of phi812, shortens from 200 to 96 nm, which pushes the tail tube 10-30 nm into the cytoplasm, depending on the local thickness of the S. aureus cell wall.

We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing to characterize the molecular diversity of brain cells across six developmental stages and four brain regions in the mouse and marmoset brain. Our analysis of over 170,000 single astrocyte nuclei revealed striking regional heterogeneity among astrocytes, particularly between telencephalic and diencephalic regions, at all developmental time points surveyed in both species. At the stages sampled, most of the region patterning was private to astrocytes and not shared with neurons or other glial types. Though astrocytes were already regionally patterned in late embryonic stages, this region-specific astrocyte gene expression signature changed dramatically over postnatal development, and its composition suggests that regional astrocytes further specialize postnatally to support their local neuronal circuits. Across mouse and marmoset, we found hundreds of species differentially expressed genes, as well as divergence in the expression of astrocytic region- and age-differentially expressed genes and the timing of astrocyte maturation relative to birth between the species. Finally, we used expansion microscopy to show that astrocyte morphology is also regionally specialized across cortex, striatum, and thalamus in the mouse.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Brain age models are typically trained on large datasets to predict chronological age, which may offer advantages in predicting specific health outcomes, much like the success of finetuning large language models for specific applications. However, it is also well-accepted that machine learning models trained to directly predict specific outcomes (i.e., direct models) often outperform those trained on surrogate objectives. Therefore, despite their much larger training data, it is unclear whether brain age models outperform direct models in predicting specific brain health outcomes. Here, we compare large-scale brain age models (pretrained on 53,542 participants) and direct models for predicting specific health outcomes related to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia. Using anatomical T1 scans from three continents (N = 1,848), we find that summarizing brain age with a single scalar (i.e., brain age gap) led to poor prediction performance. Using higher-dimensional intermediate representations of brain age models led to better prediction, but was still worse than direct models without finetuning. Using intermediate representations of finetuned brain age models was necessary to achieve similar performance as direct models. Overall, our results do not discount brain age as a useful marker of general brain health, but suggest that using chronological age as a pretraining target might be suboptimal for predicting specific health outcomes.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Addressing this challenge critically depends on linking neural dynamics to circuit structure within the same brain. Here, we combine functional calcium imaging with large-scale ultrastructural electron microscopy (EM) to uncover the wiring logic of visual evidence accumulation in larval zebrafish. In a functionally imaged EM dataset of the anterior hindbrain, we identify conserved morphological cell types whose activity patterns define distinct computational roles. Bilateral inhibition, disinhibition, and recurrent connectivity emerge as key circuit motifs shaping these dynamics. To generalize our findings across animals, we develop a photoconversion-based pipeline to label and reconstruct functionally characterized neurons, enabling us to train a classifier that predicts functional identity from morphology alone. Applying this classifier to a second, whole-brain EM dataset lacking functional data reveals matching connectivity patterns, significantly augmenting its applicability for detailed circuit dissections. Based on these results, we develop and constrain a biophysically realistic neural network model that captures observed dynamics and yields predictions we tested and confirmed experimentally.

The high-frequency gamma frequency band remains to be investigated. This study applies novel noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, namely phase-locked 40-Hz intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), and explores gamma oscillation changes in the brain. Thirty healthy young participants randomly underwent 40-Hz tACS (1), 40-Hz iTBS (2), two combined interventions (phase-locked iTBS to tACS peak sine wave or tACS trough sine wave) (3-4), and a sham condition (5). The target regions were the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and were stimulated by simultaneous tACS and iTBS. Gamma oscillatory activities (for 2 hours after intervention) were monitored following each intervention. Our results show that all stimulation protocols enhanced 40-Hz oscillatory power. The iTBS-tACS Peak shows the most significant and stable increase in gamma oscillatory activities (up to 2 hours) followed by 40-Hz tACS and 40-Hz iTBS. The 40-Hz tACS and 40-Hz iTBS protocols showed the strongest acute effects (up to 30 min) on induced gamma oscillations.

We further investigated whether tumor-specific tdLN T cells were altered by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) locally and systemically. We performed single-cell TCR lineage tracing and transcriptomic profiling on 672,886 CD8 T cells from 41 tumor, benign tdLN, and blood samples in 14 patients treated with or without neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (ChemoIO). Using deep-integrating clonal tracking with machine learning-based transcriptional analysis, our findings revealed that benign tdLNs locally and independently orchestrate two transcriptionally distinct tumor-specific memory CD8 T cell populations: one with ZNF683+ CXCR6+ tumor tissue-residency potential, and another with cytotoxic memory potential. Furthermore, tdLN-derived clones not only constitute the dominant tumor-infiltrating (75%) and circulating (>90%) tumor-specific expanded T cell populations but also preserve their transcriptionally distinct subset identities within the tumor T cell effector state. ChemoIO selectively increased the clonal diversity and cytotoxic memory/TEMRA programs of tdLN-derived clones locally and systemically, both of which remained unchanged in clones lacking tdLN TCR lineage. In conclusion, the tdLN locally orchestrates tumor-reactive and ChemoIO-reactive transcriptional distinct T cell subsets that shape the circulating blood and tumor T cell environments.

Yet, the mechanisms that transform hedonic values into motivated behaviour remain poorly understood, and key questions remain unanswered. How do habits, wanting, and liking or disliking interact to generate behaviour? Do common principles govern behaviour across species and cognitive systems, from basic survival mechanisms to complex cultural endeavours? We propose a unifying theory of motivated behaviour that integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference, a framework in which perception, action and cognition emerge from the imperative to minimise free energy. We argue that variational free energy provides a natural measure of liking and disliking, while expected free energy encodes wanting, the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes. This synthesis, which we term hedonic foraging, offers a principled explanation for how organisms navigate their environments based on pleasure-driven learning and decision-making. It posits that motivated behaviour emerges from the fundamental pursuit of maximising reward, with hedonic evaluation motivating and monitoring actions through wanting and liking mechanisms. We demonstrate that hedonic foraging captures a wide range of behaviours, from allostatic processes common to all animals to sophisticated human activities such as art appreciation and cultural exploration. Crucially, our integrative perspective fosters mutual enrichment between hedonic evaluation and active inference, two fundamental approaches to behaviour. Ultimately, hedonic foraging reinforces the view that cognition is essentially about purposive engagement in adaptive interactions with the environment and its affordances and offers a unified framework for investigating cognition and behaviour.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

If so, as female post-fertile years increased, older years increased in males too. Those still-fertile old males in the paternity competition pushed average male reproductive success below the female average. According to R. A. Fisher, Mendelian inheritance requires equal contributions from both sexes to descendant gene pools. Higher average reproductive success in one sex makes tendencies to overproduce it pass to more grandchildren, equalizing averages in descendant generations. Yet, men's lower average reproductive success persists, their fertility lasting decades longer than women's. Here, we present a simple mathematical model to investigate this phenomenon. We show that a male-biased adult sex ratio is consistent with an offspring sex ratio of 1:1. Assuming a stable age distribution, we show that if male fertile careers are twice as long as those of females, the corresponding reproductive value of males is larger than that of females, which acts to balance the effect of higher female reproductive success.

Increasingly, neuroscientists use interpersonal \"neural synchrony\" within the default mode network (DMN) to measure when two or more people subjectively experience something in similar ways. DMN synchrony as \"seeing eye-to-eye\" is typically observed when multiple people are passively observing the same stimulus. In this study, we tested whether the same DMN synchrony as \"seeing eye-to-eye\" pattern holds during social interactions. We conducted a between-subject naturalistic experiment with 70 pairs of strangers engaged in either shallow or deep conversations while brain activity was measured with functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Stranger dyads successfully formed connections, as indicated by composite connection scores. Replicating Kardas et al.

DMN neural synchrony significantly predicted self-reported connection, with synchrony in the DMN subregions of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) each correlating significantly with connection. Using machine learning classification, we distinguished high- versus low-connection dyads based on DMN neural synchrony and the perceived depth of conversation with 64.5% accuracy across 1,000 iterations. This effect was primarily carried by right TPJ, which alone classified connection strength at 62.6% accuracy.

Treatment of hiPSCs (30M, 5 days) or primary cells (30M, 3 days) with CHPG increases the percent of MBP+O4+ mature oligodendrocytes relative to total O4+cells, without affecting survival. When effects of CHPG were evaluated on proliferating OPCs, effects on proliferation are observed. In contrast, when CHPG was evaluated in young oligodendrocytes, effects on proliferation were gone, suggesting that in this population CHPG is influencing differentiation. Interestingly, in contrast to observations in mice, mGluR5 expression in humans is localized on PDGFR+ oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and O4+ immature oligodendrocytes, but not astrocytes. Moreover, using purified human OPC cultures, we show a direct effect of CHPG in enhanced differentiation. To identify potential cellular targets of CHPG in the adult human brain, we analyzed postmortem tissue from individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy controls. In contrast to the hiPSCs or fetal cells, demyelinated white matter from MS patients showed elevated mGluR5 mRNA expression in astrocytes. Taken together, our findings suggest that CHPG enhances the differentiation of human OPCs during development through a mechanism distinct from that observed in adult cuprizone-treated mice. Moreover, astrocytes in MS pathology upregulate mGluR5, suggesting they may become responsive to CHPG under disease conditions.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Much effort has been devoted to understanding TF activity in different tissues and how tissue-specificity is achieved. However, ultimately gene regulation occurs at the single cell level and the recent explosion in the availability of single cell gene expression data now makes it possible to understand TF activity at this granular level of resolution. Here, we leverage a large collection of Human Cell Atlas (HCA) single cell data to explore TF activity by examining cell-type and tissue-specific sets of target genes, or regulons. We compile a regulon atlas, CellRegulon, and map the activity of TFs in an extensive set of healthy adult and foetal tissues spanning hundreds of cell types. Using CellRegulon, we describe dynamic patterns of co-regulation, associate TF-modules with different cellular functions and characterise the distribution of active TFs and TF families across cell types. We show that CellRegulon can link disease gene expression signatures to cell types and TFs relevant to the disease. Finally, using a newly generated multiome dataset of the adult lung, we show how CellRegulon can be extended into an enhancer-gene regulatory network (eGRN) to improve cell-type associations with genetic risk loci for diseases, such as childhood onset asthma, COPD and IPF, and to identify high risk gene modules. Our database for easy download and interactive exploration allows researchers to understand key gene modules activated at cell type transitions and will therefore be valuable for tasks such as cell type engineering (https://www.cellregulondb.org).", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Current technologies to study cell-type-specific somatic mutations within tissues are low-throughput. We developed Duplex-Multiome, incorporating duplex consensus sequencing to accurately identify somatic single-nucleotide variants (sSNV) from the same nucleus simultaneously analyzed for single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) and RNA-seq (snRNA-seq). By introducing strand-tagging into the construction of snATAC-seq libraries, duplex sequencing reduces sequencing error by >10,000-fold while eliminating artifactual mutational signatures. When applied to 98%/2% mixed cell lines, Duplex-Multiome identified sSNVs present in 2% of cells with 92% precision and accurately captured known sSNV mutational spectra, while revealing unexpected subclonal lineages. Duplex-Multiome of > 51,400 nuclei from postmortem brain tissue captured sSNV burdens and spectra across all major brain cell types and subtypes, including those difficult to assay by single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS). This revealed for the first time that diverse neuronal and glial cell types show distinct rates and patterns of age-related mutation, while also directly discovering developmental cell lineage relationships. Duplex-Multiome identified clonal sSNVs occurring at increased rates in glia of certain aged brains, as well as clonal sSNVs that correlated with changes in expression of nearby genes, in both neurotypical and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) individuals, directly demonstrating that somatic mutagenesis can contribute to gene expression phenotypes.

This study investigates whether pupil dynamics to social stimuli are associated with concurrent adaptive behavior in typically developing infants. To accomplish this, we developed and assessed pupillary responses to Stimuli for Early Social Arousal and Motivation in Infants (SESAMI). Methods: A sample of forty-six typically developing children aged six to twenty-four months were exposed to SESAMI. Infants were presented with either dynamic social faces or non-social stimuli that controlled for luminance, motion, and auditory exposure. A multi-level mixed effects model was used to fit pupillary response functions (PRFs) that measure the change in pupil size over time as the infants fixate on either a socially dynamic face or a non-social control. This model produces separate social and non-social PRFs for both the population and each individual. An average individual deviation score from the population PRF was calculated separately for social and non-social trials yielding the pupil response index (PRI). Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS) were regressed on social and non-social individual PRIs while controlling for age and average fixation time. We tested whether the social PRI was a statistically significant predictor of adaptive behavior by comparing the model predicted VABS scores with observed scores. Results: An increase in PRI to social stimuli was significantly associated with better adaptive behaviors in typically developing children between 6 and 24 months of age. Conclusions: SESAMI combined with pupillometry and multi-level mixed effects modeling, provides a novel and scalable framework for quantifying individual differences in pupil changes in response to social stimuli relative to a population-level baseline. By demonstrating that pupil response indices during social fixations predict adaptive behaviors, we lay the foundation to test how these measures may help identify infants with intellectual and developmental disorders.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

M.; Chavlis, S.; Hammond, L.; Katz, Y.; Losonczy, A.; Polleaux, F.; Poirazi, P.", "abstract": "The synaptic mechanisms driving feature selectivity in specific neuron types remains a fundamental and unresolved challenge in neuroscience. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs), the development of place selectivity, manifested as place fields, is believed to result from dendritic integration of spatially distributed inputs combined with behavioral time scale plasticity (BTSP). BTSP involves dendritic spikes that temporally regulate synaptic potentiation and depotentiation. However, the role of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) synaptic distributions in the emergence of place specificity in CA1 PNs remains unclear, due to the lack of detailed synaptic reconstructions in vivo. Here, we present full synaptic reconstructions from individual CA1 PNs in the mouse hippocampus, revealing that these neurons receive approximately 10,000-15,000 E synapses and 900-1,400 I synapses. Computational modeling of biologically relevant E and I synaptic distributions shows that spatial tuning is preserved with co-tuned, spatially clustered E synapses, but disrupted when E distributions are randomized. Moreover, synapse clustering has a different contribution to spatial tuning in apical vs. basal domains. Our results reveal a complex and finely-tuned interplay between presynaptic input patterns and the spatial organization of their postsynaptic targets in dictating neuronal output in CA1 PNs.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Neuronal firing rates modulated strongly in vPCG as a function of attempted mimed, whispered, normal or loud speech. At the neural ensemble level, mode/loudness and phonemic content were encoded in distinct neural subspaces. Attempted mode/loudness could be decoded from vPCG with an accuracy of 94% and 89% for two participants respectively, and corresponding neural preparatory activity could be detected hundreds of milliseconds before speech onset.

S.", "abstract": "Understanding how the brain integrates multisensory information during detection and decision-making remains an active area of research. While many inferences have been drawn about behavioural outcomes, key questions persist regarding both the nature of environmental cues and the internal mechanisms of integration. These complexities make multisensory integration particularly well suited to investigate through mathematical modelling. In this study, we present three models of audio-visual integration within a biologically motivated mean-field recurrent framework. These models extend a non-linear system of differential equations originally developed for unisensory decision-making. The OR and SUM models represent opposing ends of the integration spectrum: the former simulates independent unisensory processing using a winner-take-all (WTA) strategy, while the latter implements a linear summation model for full integration. A third model, the REPEAT Model, incorporates switch and repeat costs observed in multisensory tasks. We simulate 121 participants with varying unisensory evidence accumulation rates, capturing behavioural diversity from modality dominance to balanced integration. Model outputs (reaction time and accuracy) were compared with empirical results from audio-visual detection tasks. We further fit the outputs to a drift diffusion model, allowing comparison between simulated and theoretically optimal multisensory drift rates. The OR and SUM Models reproduced established unisensory response patterns. Drift diffusion analysis revealed suboptimal integration in the OR Model and optimal integration in the SUM Model. However, the SUM Model also produced supra-optimal responses under certain conditions, inconsistent with behavioural data. The REPEAT Model successfully captured the role of priming in sensory repetition effects, distinguishing it from true multisensory integration. Overall, these models highlight how biologically grounded mathematical frameworks can shed light on the mechanisms underlying multisensory integration, particularly the nuanced contributions of modality repetition and integration efficiency.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Dexmedetomidine is a selective 2-adrenergic agonist used as an anesthesia adjunct to produce a state of sleep-like sedation. However, how brain activity compares quantitatively during dexmedetomidine anesthesia to that during natural sleep, and thus just how \"sleep-like\" dexmedetomidine anesthesia is, remains unclear. Previously, we showed that the general anesthetic propofol is associated with changes in connectivity and cortical network structure comparable to those observed during sleep. Here, we compare the effects on brain activity of dexmedetomidine, propofol, and sleep quantitatively using intracranial encephalographic (iEEG) recordings in human research participants. Methods. iEEG recordings were obtained in 34 epilepsy patients being evaluated for potential seizure resection surgery. Band power and functional connectivity (alpha weighted phase lag index, gamma envelope correlations) and network entropy were measured in recordings during task-free (\"resting state\") periods just prior to surgery during anesthesia with either dexmedetomidine or propofol, and during overnight sleep. Anesthesia stage (wake, sedated, unresponsive) was determined using the Observer's Assessment of Arousal and Sedation. Sleep was staged using standard polysomnography. Results. As expected, significant differences in delta power were observed during dexmedetomidine and propofol as well as during sleep. However, the magnitude of changes in delta power were smaller and regionally heterogeneous for propofol compared to dexmedetomidine and sleep. Functional connectivity changes were comparable between dexmedetomidine, propofol, and natural sleep. Significant changes in network entropy were observed for dexmedetomidine, propofol, and sleep, but changes were larger for propofol compared to dexmedetomidine and sleep. Quantitative comparisons between changes in delta power and network entropy suggest that unresponsiveness under dexmedetomidine produces a similar brain state to that observed during N2 sleep. Conclusions. While delta power, functional connectivity, and network entropy all showed changes during propofol, dexmedetomidine, and sleep, the magnitudes of these changes suggest that dexmedetomidine is more similar than propofol to sleep, specifically to N2 sleep.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Early symptoms are often linked to dysfunctions in the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe. This study aims to clarify WM alterations in early-stage psychosis and elucidate the role of structural connectivity (SC) in its pathophysiology. STUDY DESIGN: We analysed SC derived from diffusion MRI in 127 patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia (FES group), compared with healthy controls. Focusing on the fronto-parietal-temporal network, we examined SC across three hierarchical levels: network, node, and connection. SC metrics were compared between groups using 3-factor ANCOVA, accounting for relevant covariates. We also investigated associations between SC metrics and core positive symptoms using non-parametric correlations. RESULTS: The FES group showed significantly reduced average SC strength and global efficiency within the fronto-parietal-temporal network. At the nodal level, SC strength was significantly lower in the left inferior and middle temporal gyri (L.ITG, L.MTG), and in the right inferior parietal gyrus (R.IPG) and temporal pole (R.TP). No significant group differences emerged at the connection level. Notably, SC strength in the R.IPG was negatively correlated with Conceptual Disorganisation scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal global and regional SC disruptions in early psychosis, particularly in areas supporting cognitive, language, and executive functions. The observed association between R.IPG connectivity and Conceptual Disorganisation supports the link between disrupted SC and formal thought disorder, reinforcing the role of impaired structural integration in early psychosis.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Two protein-based vaccines and one mRNA vaccine have been approved, all targeting the prefusion conformation of the fusion (F) glycoprotein. However, it has been reported that the F protein transitions to the post-fusion state during storage, resulting in a reduction of the vaccines' immunogenicity. Methods: In this study, we engineered novel pre-F-based antigens to preserve pre-F-specific immunodominant epitopes while eliminating sub-potent ones. Based on this, we constructed a series of single-chain dimers and selected the one with the highest expression yield and melting temperature (Tm). Next, we created a heterodimer, scDimer AB. Structural and protein characterization analyses were conducted to verify our design. All monomeric and scDimer antigens were used to immunize rodent models. Additionally, we prepared the antigens in mRNA form and immunized BALB/c mice. Finally, we combined both antigen forms, administering intramuscular mRNA priming followed by intranasal protein delivery in mice. In all immunization strategies, viral challenges were performed in animals to evaluate the immunologic protective effects. Findings: Through rational design, we developed a monomeric and two single-chain dimeric (scDimer) proteins with the expected characteristics, including complete II, V, and 0; epitopes and a partial III epitope. The scDimers elicited stronger binding and neutralizing antibody responses in rodent models compared to the monomer, and they also boosted T cell responses when combined with appropriate adjuvants. After three doses of scDimer immunization, live RSV was barely detectable in the tissues of infected animals. The copies of RNA encoding N-gene were significantly reduced in the immunized groups compared to the PBS-injected control groups. We also engineered mRNA versions of the antigens and verified their protective efficacy in mice. Notably, there were no significant differences between intranasal boost and intramuscular two doses after RSV challenged, suggesting that intranasal boost provided equivalent protection to intramuscular vaccination and could reduce the risk of vaccine-enhanced disease (VED) potentially. Interpretation: The scDimer-based RSV vaccines effectively protected rodents from RSV infections, highlighting their clinical potential. Our antigen design removed certain suboptimal epitope regions, enhancing the efficiency of antigen presentation and increasing the proportion of the most potent pre-F-specific neutralizing antibodies. This approach provides a novel perspective for future vaccine design.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Although mouse models have aided understanding of some pacemaker genes and arrhythmias, mice are not known to naturally acquire arrhythmias, and the substantial differences between mouse and human cardiac anatomy and physiology have limited their utility in preclinical studies and pharmacological testing (2-6). To establish a primate genetic model organism for arrhythmias, we carried out an electrocardiographic (ECG) screen of over 350 lab and wild mouse lemurs (Microcebus spp.), an emerging model organism that is among the smallest, fastest-reproducing, and most abundant primates (7). Twenty-two lemurs (6.2%) were identified with eight different naturally-occurring arrhythmias resembling human ECG pathologies (SSS, PACs, Afib, PVCs, NSVT, STD, iTWs, STE). Pedigree construction showed two were familial, premature atrial contractions (PACs)/atrial fibrillation (Afib) and sick sinus syndrome (SSS), an episodic bradycardia. Genome sequencing of the SSS pedigree mapped the disease locus to a 1.4 Mb interval on chromosome 7 and supported autosomal recessive Mendelian inheritance. The most appealing candidate gene in the interval was SLC41A2, a little studied magnesium transporter. SLC41A2 is expressed in human iPS-derived sinoatrial node cells (SANC) and localizes to the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Although mouse SLC41A2 knockouts do not show a cardiac pacemaker phenotype, CRISPR-mediated SLC41A2 knockout altered human SANC magnesium dynamics and slowed their calcium transient firing rate. The results suggest SLC41A2 functions cell autonomously and primate-specifically in cardiac pacemaker cells, and that intracellular magnesium dynamics have a crucial but previously unappreciated role in setting pacemaker rate. Thus, mouse lemur is a valuable model for discovering new genes, molecules, and mechanisms of the primate pacemaker, and for identifying novel candidate genes and therapeutic targets for human arrhythmias.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

However, the mechanisms underlying sarcomere formation and assembly in vivo, which are critical for the formation of functional myofibers in vertebrates, remain poorly understood. Defects in sarcomeres contribute to muscle dysfunction in numerous genetic and acquired myopathies, yet the lack of a clear understanding of specific sarcomeric defects has hindered the development of effective therapies. Nemaline myopathy (NM) is caused by mutations in genes that primarily affect sarcomere structure and function. The disease is clinically heterogeneous, with the congenital form being the most severe. Using zebrafish models of congenital forms of NM, we investigated sarcomere assembly in vivo during skeletal muscle development to identify key steps contributing to myofibril formation and muscle growth under both normal and disease conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the gene encoding the sarcomeric protein KLHL41 plays a critical role in the formation and directional organization of new sarcomeres within developing myofibrils, facilitating both radial and longitudinal muscle growth. Dysregulation of sarcomeric proteins and impaired protein turnover in the KLHL41-NM zebrafish model resulted in the development of sarcomeric defects. Moreover, we show that the interaction between the KLHL41-troponin complex is essential for muscle growth and cross-bridge regulation in developing muscle.

However, ruminant production is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, particularly with respect to methane (CH4), with ruminants contributing 33% of all anthropogenic CH4 emissions. CH4 is produced due to the natural fermentative processes undertaken by the complex rumen microbiome, primarily via the utilisation of hydrogen by rumen archaea to form CH4. Previous studies have shown that feeding the red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis (ASP) to ruminants can reduce CH4 emissions from beef cattle by up to 80% (Roque et al., 2021). Nevertheless, the mechanism of action of this seaweed in terms of effects on the rumen microbiome is largely unknown, which is the main focus of this study. Six Nordic Red cows at 122 +/- 13.7 (mean +/- SD) days in milk were divided into 3 blocks by milk yield in Latin square design and fed grass silage and a commercial concentrate (60:40) either with or without 0.5% ASP on an organic matter basis. Rumen fluid was collected 19 days into each experimental period, with a holistic approach using both assembly and read mapping based approaches to interrogate taxonomic, functional, and ecological shifts applied to metagenomic data. We show that ASP reduces methane production not only through direct inhibition of methanogens but also by disrupting cobamide-dependent metabolic pathways and redirecting carbon flow toward pyruvate and propionate rather than acetate and methane. For the first time, specific enzymes involved in vitamin B12 (cobamide) biosynthesis are identified as suppressed by ASP, and microbial taxa contributing to these functional changes are elucidated showing both niche displacement and resilience within the rumen microbiome.

We identified genomic features involved in replication (oriC), carotenoid synthesis (crt), and genome defence (CRISPR-Cas), and discovered four novel mobile elements (ISKrh4-7). Despite its environmental ubiquity and relevance to food production, bioremediation, and human medicine, there have been few genomic studies of the Kocuria genus. We conducted a comparative, phylogenetic, and pangenomic examination of all 257 publicly available Kocuria genomes, with a particular focus on the 56 that were identified as K. rhizophila. We found that there are two phylogenetically distinct clades of K. rhizophila, with within-clade ANI values of 96.7-100.0% and between-clade values of 89.5-90.4%. The second clade, which we refer to as K. pseudorhizophila, exhibited ANI values of <95% relative to TA68 and constitutes a separate species. Delineation of the two clades would be consistent with the rest of the genus, where all other species satisfy the 95% ANI threshold criteria. Differences in the K. rhizophila and K. pseudorhizophila pangenomes likely reflect phenotypic as well as evolutionary divergence. This distinction is relevant to clinical and industrial settings, as strains and genomes from both clades are currently used interchangeably, which may lead to reproducibility issues and phenotype-genotype discordance.

A.", "abstract": "Background In uncemented hip arthroplasty, achieving sufficient primary stability is essential for long-term implant success. However, objective intraoperative assessment of fixation quality remains challenging. Acoustic analysis of stem impaction sounds offers a promising tool for real-time evaluation, but its diagnostic accuracy and biomechanical correlation require further validation. Methods Twelve formalin-fixed human femora were implanted with cementless Metha short stems under three predefined anchorage conditions: loose, optimal (fit), and fracture-inducing press-fit. Impaction sounds were recorded using calibrated microphones and processed via frequency-domain analysis. Relative micromotions were quantified under torsional loading to biomechanically assess primary stability. Results Spectral markers reliably differentiated between anchorage states. The transition from loose to fit showed minimal spectral change, while fit-to-fracture was characterized by a significant increase in low-frequency energy (<2.5 kHz) and pronounced attenuation in high-frequency bands (>15 kHz). These acoustic signatures closely correlated with biomechanically measured micromotions, which showed a distinct hierarchy: fracture < fit < loose. Cluster permutation analysis confirmed statistically significant differences, particularly in the fracture group. Conclusion This in vitro study demonstrates that frequency-based acoustic analysis can distinguish between stable, insufficient, and over-press-fit conditions during stem implantation. The findings support the potential of intraoperative acoustic monitoring as a real-time, objective tool to enhance implant safety and detect cortical compromise before it becomes clinically apparent.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

The artificial tendon, woven by collagen threads derived from soluble collagen, is a biomimetic tendon with a composition, structure and function akin to natural tendons. The biomimetic tendon exhibits exceptional tensile strength of (43.4 MPa), surpassing that of the natural Achilles tendon (39.1MPa). The remarkable mechanical properties, coupled with its favorable biocompatibility and low immunogenicity, underscore the substantial clinical application potential of this biomimetic material. A biomimetic tendon was implanted to repair a rabbit model of a 2 cm tendon defect without employing exogenous cells or growth factors. Twenty weeks after transplantation, the mechanical properties of the regenerated tendon were restored to approximately 80.1% of those of the natural Achilles tendon. This biomimetic tendon not only provides mechanical support during the initial phase of cell recruitment but also sustains strength to facilitate functional tendon reconstruction until material degradation and complete tendon regeneration. The regenerated tendon tissue exhibited regularly arranged dense collagen fibers along the longitudinal axis of the natural tendons, demonstrating high mechanical strength and seamless integration. Histological analysis further revealed a progressive enhancement in collagen fiber diameter, density, and structural integrity within regenerated tendons over time, closely resembling the characteristics of natural Achilles tendons eventually. Notably, there were no apparent immune reactions or inflammatory responses during the experimental cycle. These findings unequivocally demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of biomimetic tendons in facilitating functional tissue regeneration, underscoring their significant medical and scientific value. This study not only presents a novel treatment approach for tendon injury repair but also establishes the foundation for future clinical tendon and ligament regeneration and repair, with extensive clinical application prospects.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Sequence screening is one component of a biosecurity protocol for preventing such harm and consists of differentiating Sequences of Concern (SOCs) from benign sequences that are not associated with pathogenicity or toxicity. There exist many fit-for-purpose tools that have been developed for DNA synthesis sequence screening. However, questions remain regarding their performance with respect to consistency of screening. To aid in determining if screening tools are harmonized in regard to baseline sequence screening, NIST constructed a test dataset based on current screening recommendations. NIST then sent blinded datasets to sequence screening tool developers for testing. Overall, there was a general agreement between the tools and NIST assignments of the sequences and all tools had a baseline performance of greater than 95% sensitivity and 97% accuracy. Disagreement on specific sequences largely arose from single tools and could be traced to differences in defining a SOC and/or methodological differences in screening algorithms.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

This study investigates the interaction between tumor emboli and the tumor immune microenvironment (TiME) that can foster survival signaling. Experimental Design: Spatial immunophenotyping was performed on clinical IBC samples. Ex vivo tumor emboli were generated from patient-derived cell lines cultured in a lymphatic-like platform and subjected to transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. A transgenic CX3cr1GFP murine model was generated for visualization of macrophages and tumor emboli within the TiME via a surgically implanted window chamber, enabling intravital imaging and targeting. Results: Gene and protein analysis of tumor emboli cultures compared to 2D monolayer cultures revealed upregulation of TNFR signaling networks, CXCL8, and immune cell chemotaxis genes. Spatial immunophenotyping of IBC patient tumors demonstrated high levels of CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Furthermore, intravital imaging of CX3cr1GFP mice confirmed macrophage movement toward tumor cell clusters. Finally, targeting macrophage-associated TNF--signaling using Birinapant, a SMAC mimetic, inhibited the tumor emboli phenotype in vivo. Conclusions: This study, the first to our knowledge, identifies TNF signaling and macrophage infiltration in IBC tumor emboli. Strategies targeting TNF signaling to induce cell death and reduce macrophage influence has the potential to improve IBC outcomes.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

As fasting is associated with a rise in circulating ketones, we decided to investigate the role of ketogenesis in CR using mice with whole-body ablation of Hmgcs2, the rate-limiting enzyme producing the main ketone body {beta}-hydroxybutyrate ({beta}HB). Here, we report that Hmgcs2 is largely dispensable for many metabolic benefits of CR, including CR-driven changes in adiposity, glycemic control, liver autophagy, and energy balance. Although we observed sex-specific effects of Hmgcs2 on insulin sensitivity, fuel selection, and adipocyte gene expression, the overall physiological response to CR remains robust in mice lacking Hmgcs2. To gain insight into why deletion of Hmgcs2 does not disrupt CR, we measured fasting {beta}HB levels as mice began a CR diet.

Prosopis cineraria is a leguminous phreatophyte distributed across arid and semi-arid regions of India and can tolerate very high temperatures due to its adaptive physiological and biochemical mechanisms. Therefore, P. cineraria represents a repository of genes for abiotic stress tolerance. Two-months-old P. cineraria plants were subjected to heat stress at two different temperature regimes and transcriptome sequencing was performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs).

In this work, we explore how a polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogel depot technology can be engineered to prolong protein delivery. In-vivo studies in mice and rats demonstrate prolonged protein release, and modeling efforts predict the impact of both the elimination half-life of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and hydrogel depot volume on overall pharmacokinetics. Moreover, flow cytometry characterization reveals that immune cell infiltration into the hydrogel depot can result in faster-than-expected release of antibody cargo on account of active transport via cellular uptake. We then demonstrate that co-formulation of antibodies with an anti-inflammatory agent reduces cellular infiltration and resulting active transport, further extending delivery and pharmacokinetics. Finally, multicompartmental modeling predicts the human PK profiles of clinically relevant HIV bnAbs delivered via subcutaneous hydrogel injection.

In this study, we conducted structure-function studies focused on the N-termini of these two chemokines to identify determinants of receptor activation, internalization and binding specificity. Deletion of two N-terminal residues of CCL27 resulted in a CCR10 antagonist, highlighting the critical roles of these residues in driving receptor pharmacology. Extension with a Phe produced a superagonist by occupying an available subpocket in the receptor binding site. Swapping the N-terminus of CCL28 onto the CCL27 globular domain (NT28-CCL27) also resulted in a superagonist of CCR10, but the opposite swap (NT27-CCL28) showed equivalent or reduced activity compared to WT CCL28, indicating that the CCL28 N-terminus is a stronger driver of CCR10 signaling. The effect of these and other mutations were rationalized by AlphaFold models of the CCR10 complexes. AlphaFold modeling also revealed that the reduced size of the binding pocket, and more basic nature of the N-terminus and extracellular loops of CCR3 compared to CCR10, contribute to its specificity for CCL28 while CCR10 accommodates both ligands. The overall basic nature of CCL28 also contributes to its high affinity for glycosaminoglycans, which is likely important for its retention in mucosal tissues. These data illustrate the modular compositions of these chemokines that has evolved to achieve overlapping but non-redundant functions, and the exploitation of this modular nature to produce engineered chemokines for probing or targeting CCR10 in disease contexts.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

The receptors for VEGF and PlGF, membrane-bound VEGFR, are expressed in placental trophoblast cells, but their functions are largely unknown. Placenta production of leptin significantly increases in preeclampsia, and we recently showed leptin induces placental and vascular endothelial dysfunction in pregnancy. We hypothesized that there is a mechanistic link in which inappropriately high sFlt-1 in preeclampsia leads to an increase in trophoblast leptin production. We treated human placental explants and trophoblast cells with sFlt-1 and show an increase in leptin peptide production, which is ablated by coadministration with either VEGF or placental growth factor (PLGF). We further demonstrate that VEGFR1 and 3, not R2, expressions are predominant in human trophoblasts and that reducing activation of these receptors mediates trophoblast leptin production. In pregnant mice, we show that sFlt-1 infusion induces vascular endothelial dysfunction in association with significantly elevated plasma leptin levels. In pregnant sFlt-1-infused mice treatment with leptin receptor antagonist significantly ablated vascular endothelial dysfunction. Collectively, these data indicate that angiogenic imbalance in preeclampsia impacts placental trophoblast endocrine function by suppressing VEGFR1 and 3 activation, resulting in leptin overproduction.

J.; Jones, S. T.; Savelli, F.", "abstract": "(Re)mapping of different environments by hippocampal place cells is thought to reflect incidental learning. Rat head scanning is a spontaneous and presumed investigatory behavior that can trigger the onset of firing locations in place cells. This behavior was studied on (quasi-)circular tracks, and it was speculated that off-track head scans might have been overlooked or inadvertently discouraged in studies employing more common apparatus. To better understand the general prevalence and significance of off-track scanning, we investigated it in rats running laps on linear tracks in rooms featuring visual landmarks. Rats scanned along the entire length of the track, even in highly familiar conditions and when they were rewarded only at the two ends of the track (albeit less than rats rewarded throughout the track), demonstrating that co-localized rewards are not necessary for the occurrence of this behavior. Scanning rate increased markedly in a novel room and then declined steeply during each daily session in this room over 3 days. Partial daily boosts transiently counteracted this decline, producing a seesaw profile that is reminiscent of previous observations on rat rearing or place cell plasticity. Moreover, the remapping that place cells are known to undergo in similar context changes could conceivably be facilitated by the putative surge of new place fields induced by increased scanning. Hence, investigatory behaviors could be causally involved in the representational and dynamic properties of hippocampal representations. Addressing these possibilities could help uncover the learning processes governing the incidental creation and update of a cognitive map.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

However, in hearing animals, it has been challenging to dissociate auditory feedback from other motor-related signals. In this study, to isolate non-auditory contributions, we recorded IC neural activity during locomotion in deafened mice, thereby eliminating all auditory feedback through both air and bone conduction. Even in the absence of auditory input, IC neurons exhibited robust, bidirectional modulation during locomotion. Timing analysis using electromyography revealed both predictive and feedback components relative to locomotion onset. Furthermore, the timing and direction of modulation varied considerably across different locomotion bouts, suggesting convergence of multiple non-auditory inputs. These findings demonstrate that non-auditory, movement-related signals significantly shape auditory midbrain activity through both predictive and feedback mechanisms.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Background: With current cochlear implant surgical techniques, placement of the EA is a blind maneuver in which the surgeon relies on tactile feedback as the EA advances through the cochlear lumen. Cochlear implant trauma is a leading factor for poor speech performance outcomes and loss of residual hearing following surgery. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging modality that provides real-time visualization of tissue microstructure at higher spatial resolutions compared to clinical CT and MRI. Already adopted as standard of care in ophthalmology, OCT has the potential to assist the surgeon in real-time visualization of the EA trajectory. Unlike commercial systems, our custom OCT system allows tailored wavelength, scanning geometry, and real-time processing, which are critical factors for navigating the compact anatomy of the facial recess to image the cochlea. Methods: A custom-built SD-OCT system was used to image cochlear microanatomy in mice and human cadaveric temporal bones. The OCT system was then used to guide a mock EA in human cadaveric temporal bones in real-time using individual B scans that were reviewed sequentially as the EA was being advanced through the round window. Results: Using our OCT system, high-resolution (< 5.0 m) images of cochlear microanatomy were obtained in both mice and cadaveric human temporal bones with an image sensitivity of ~104 dB. Following cochleostomy in cadaveric temporal bones, real-time sequential OCT B-scans were used to reliably guide placement of the EA through the scala tympani. Conclusion: Our custom-built SD-OCT platform can generate high-resolution real-time visualization and orientation of mammalian cochlear microanatomy that can be used to assist with real time guidance of a CI EA.

It is unclear how hallucinatory proneness changes across the lifespan, with prior questionnaire-based studies showing mixed results. As factors such as multi-sensory acuity loss and relatively increased reliance on prior knowledge may increase as we age, and these are considered risk factors for hallucination proneness, we hypothesised that reported decreases in hallucinations might reflect stigma-related underreporting. We therefore sought to measure hallucination proneness in 44 healthy adults spanning the adult lifespan (younger age group; n=22; age 19-39 years, mean: 27.2, SD: 5.5; older age group n=22; age 59-79 years, mean: 68.0, SD: 5.8), quantifying the tendency to experience complex and simple hallucinations in an experimental environment designed to elicit hallucinations. We find that reports of complex hallucinations (those representing objects, scenes, etc) are lower in older adults than in younger adults, both in real time and retrospectively. None of our measured cognitive or sensory measures (visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, perceptual reorganisation, imagery vividness, memory inhibition, and suggestibility) mediate this relationship. We conclude that reduced complex hallucination proneness appears normative in ageing, and that experiencing hallucinations in older individuals may signal underlying pathology.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

W.", "abstract": "Loss of distal hand and finger control is among the most disabling consequences of stroke. Functional outcomes are typically worse when infarcts involve subcortical white matter tracts, particularly the internal capsule, yet most preclinical stroke models target cortical regions. To address this gap, we developed a non-human primate model of internal capsule infarct using stereotactically guided endothelin-1 injections to disrupt descending fibers from the primary motor cortex hand area. Serial structural and diffusion MRI, along with histology, confirmed subcortical infarcts centered on the targeted white matter region with no apparent cortical involvement. Motor function was assessed pre- and post-infarct using a joystick-based center-out task (proximal forelimb control) and a Kluver board task (distal forelimb control). Animals exhibited variable impairments in proximal function and consistent post-infarct deficits in distal function, including reduced contralesional hand use, longer retrieval time, and increased in-well digit flexions. One animal showed mild post-infarct impairment and the smallest lesion, highlighting that this model reflects inter-individual differences in infarct size and functional outcome as seen in human subcortical stroke. In contrast, the other two animals developed a compensatory wrist-extended posture on the Kluver board task by 4 weeks post-infarct, which stabilized the hand and enabled improved digit flexion. Incorporating this behavioral adaptation into statistical models improved prediction of motor performance. The observed adaptation may have drawn on spared corticospinal output pathways, allowing animals to re-engage pre-existing motor routines to perform the retrieval. While future studies may benefit from ethologically relevant tasks to further elucidate such adaptations, findings from this study recapitulate key features of human subcortical stroke, including persistent distal motor deficits and emergence of adaptive motor strategies. By combining precise lesioning, longitudinal imaging, and detailed behavioral analysis, this model provides a translationally oriented platform for studying white matter stroke mechanisms and evaluating interventions that promote functional recovery.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

L.; Leclerc, S.; Veillette, M.; Duchaine, C.; Villarreal, J. C.", "abstract": "Background and Aims Antibiotics are natural compounds produced by microorganisms that have long existed in ecosystems. However, the widespread clinical and agricultural use of antibiotics has intensified selective pressures on bacteria, leading to the proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). The increasing prevalence of these genetic elements now poses a major global health threat. While ARGs are well documented in anthropogenically influenced environments, their distribution and origins in remote ecosystems, such as the boreal forests, remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the occurrence, diversity, and potential origins of ARGs in the boreal lichen Cladonia stellaris. Methods We conducted the first targeted assessment of ARGs in lichens by analyzing 42 C. stellaris samples from northern and southern lichen woodlands (LWs) in eastern Canada. Using high-throughput quantitative PCR, we screened for 33 ARGs and three mobile genetic elements (MGEs), quantifying their relative abundance. Bacterial community composition was characterized via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Statistical analyses evaluated geographical patterns, ARGs-taxa association, and the influence of latitude on ARG distribution. Key Results Ten ARGs conferring resistance to four antibiotic classes (aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, quinolones and sulfonamides), along with one MGE, were detected. Three ARGs, blaCTX-M-1, qnrB, and qepA, were highly prevalent, with qepA often surpassing 16S rRNA gene abundance. Latitude significantly influenced ARG profiles, whereas bacterial community composition did not. Network analysis identified Connexibacter, Granulicella, and Novosphingobium as potential hosts for qnrB, and Tundrisphaera and Terriglobus for qepA. To explain ARGs presence, we explored two hypotheses: bioaerosol dispersal from anthropogenic sources, and endogenous development through co-evolution between lichen-produced antimicrobial compounds and their associated bacterial communities. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that C. stellaris harbors diverse ARGs in remote boreal ecosystems, highlighting the ecological complexity of ARG persistence and the need to investigate not only ARG presence, but also the processes driving their distribution in natural environments.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Environmental variations introduce inconsistencies in color perception, affecting the reliability of automated image processing algorithms. In previous work, we developed a hybrid algorithm, AInsectID Version 1.1 Color Merge, to overcome challenges posed by over-segmentation and under-segmentation in insect wing color clustering. We achieved this by using color differences between superpixels to measure homogeneity during the superpixels segmentation process. Nevertheless, our algorithm remains sensitive to environmental effects, affecting its performance and accuracy in color analyses. Here, we introduce a standard imaging method for insect species, as a pre-requisite to analysis in AInsectID Version 1.1 Color Merge. We systematically examine the effects of varying lighting conditions, angle of observation, and working distance in a controlled environment to assess their impact on the performance of the algorithm. We find that by meticulously controlling lighting, working distance, and lighting angle, we develop an evidence-based standard approach to imaging colors that is robust and repeatable. By following our standardized procedure, consistent color analyses are possible under varying environmental conditions. The method was tested using the Delta E2000 ({Delta}E) color difference metric with a threshold of 1, demonstrating that our standard approach maintains perceptual accuracy within the Just Noticeable Difference (JND) range, while improving the reliability of color analyses of insect wings in diverse environments.

P.; O'Dell, R.", "abstract": "Background: The primary cholinergic input to the cerebral cortex arises from the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), a group of magnocellular neurons clustered within the posterior basal forebrain cholinergic system (BFCS). Postmortem and in vivo neuroimaging studies have demonstrated significant neuronal loss and BFCS atrophy, most prominently in the nbM, in both mild cognitive impairment and dementia due to Alzheimers disease (AD). However, less is known surrounding the relationship between accumulating Alzheimers pathology, BFCS atrophy, and cognition during early preclinical stages of AD. Methods: The current study investigates the relationship between sub-structural BFCS volume and cortical amyloid burden in cognitively unimpaired middle-aged individuals at varying genetic risk for AD. Cognitively unimpaired participants aged 50-65 with a first-degree family history for AD were genetically screened to select three groups: APOE genotype e4e4 (n=15), e3e4 (n=15), and e3e3 (n=15), matched for age and sex. Participants underwent imaging with [11C]PiB PET and structural 3T MRI. Distribution volumes ratios (DVR) with a whole cerebellum reference region were calculated for [11C]PiB PET analyses. BFCS sub-structural volumes were obtained from regions of interest generated from the SPM8 Anatomy Toolbox (Ch1-3, Ch4). Results: BFCS amyloid burden was highest among APOE e4e4 homozygotes (Ch1-3, F(2, 42)=3.26, P=0.048; Ch4, F(2, 42)=3.82, P= 0.03). Ch4(nbM), but not Ch1-3 volume, was found to be inversely associated with global amyloid burden (Pearson r=-0.40, P=0.007). Exploratory analyses in groups stratified by amyloid positivity demonstrated reduced Ch4 volume (P=0.032) and significant inverse associations between Ch4 volume and amyloid burden (Pearson r = -0.70, P=0.02) in amyloid+ participants. Medial temporal lobe (MTL) volumes were neither significantly different between amyloid+ vs. amyloid- participants nor were they associated with global amyloid burden in either amyloid+ participants, amyloid- participants, or the pooled sample. Conclusions: We observed nbM (Ch4), but not MTL volume, to be significantly inversely associated with cortical amyloid burden in cognitively unimpaired, amyloid+, older adults at varying genetic risk for AD. These findings provide further in vivo evidence suggesting BFCS (specifically nbM) atrophy may precede medial temporal atrophy in the preclinical stage of AD and that nbM atrophy is an early structural correlate of AD pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

We hypothesized that auditory-evoked emotions would influence the appraisal of textured surfaces, with corresponding changes reflected in cortical excitability. Participants actively rubbed two different textured surfaces (slippery and rough) either without movement sonification, or with pleasant or disagreeable movement sonification. We found that sounds, whether agreeable or disagreeable, did not change the texture appraisal. However, the less pleasant surface was associated with a stronger negative hedonic valence, particularly when paired with disagreeable movement sonification. Time frequency analyses of EEG activities revealed a significant reduction in beta-band power [15-25 Hz] within the source-estimated sensorimotor and superior posterior parietal cortices when contrasting both pleasant and unpleasant sound with the silent touch. This suggests that the primary somatosensory cortices together with the superior parietal regions participated in the audio-tactile binding, with both pleasant and unpleasant sounds. In addition, we observed a significant increase in beta-band power in medial visual areas, specifically when disagreeable movement sonification was paired with tactile exploration. This may reflect a disengagement of visual cortical processing, potentially amplifying auditory-driven emotional responses and intensifying the perceived unpleasantness of the explored surfaces.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Computational modelling and electrophysiological investigations have pointed to dynamic 'urgency' processes that serve to progressively reduce the quantity of evidence required to reach choice commitment as time elapses. To date, such urgency dynamics have been observed exclusively in neural signals that accumulate evidence for a specific motor plan. Across three complementary experiments, we show that a classic ERP component, the Contingent Negative Variation (CNV), also traces dynamic urgency but exhibits unique properties not observed in effector-selective signals. Firstly, it provides a representation of urgency alone, growing only as a function of time and not evidence strength. Secondly, when choice reports must be withheld until a response cue, the CNV peaks and decays long before response execution, mirroring the early termination dynamics of a motor-independent evidence accumulation signal. These properties suggest that the brain may use urgency signals not only to expedite motor planning but also to hasten cognitive deliberation. These data demonstrate that urgency processes operate in a variety of perceptual choice scenarios and that they can be monitored in a model-independent manner via non-invasive brain signals.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

It remains unclear whether autoinflammatory events precede or follow hyperkeratotic changes in hair follicle (HF) epithelia. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we characterized HF cell populations in HS patients and investigated their role in disease pathogenesis. We uncovered two distinct differentiation trajectories of HF stem cells (HF-SCs): one leading to interfollicular epidermis (IFE) basal cells enriched in inflammatory pathways, and another giving rise to outer root sheath (ORS) cells associated with keratinization. In HS lesions, both populations displayed altered inflammatory phenotypes and were closely linked to immune cell infiltration, pointing to a role in disease heterogeneity. By integrating clinical features with HF cell composition from 49 HS patients, we identified three major endotypes: (i) an inflammatory subtype, marked by T cell infiltration and an expansion of IFE basal cells; (ii) a keratinizing subtype, characterized by ORS enrichment and minimal inflammation; and (iii) a mixed subtype, exhibiting features of follicular remodeling, fistula formation, and variable immune involvement. These findings provide novel insights into the epithelial-immune interactions that drive HS and support a stratified therapeutic approach tailored to the specific HF dysfunctions of each patient subgroup.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

It is known that the hippocampus and cortex both play a pivotal role in memory processes and are affected by the neuroinflammation associated with cerebral malaria that causes long-lasting cognitive and behavioral sequelae. Since these sequelae are also associated with the non-severe form of malaria, it is important to correlate brain morphology, particularly glial cell involvement, and neuroimmune and neuroinflammatory features with memory acquisition and consolidation processes, in this clinical presentation of malaria, the most frequent worldwide. Here, we aimed to investigate cellular and molecular neuroimmune aspects of non-severe experimental malaria-associated cognitive dysfunction. Female C57BL/6 mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA and treated with chloroquine before any clinical signs of cerebral malaria emerged. No histopathological alteration, in hematoxylin-eosin staining, or axonal damage, in Bielschowsky's silver- impregnated brain sections, was observed. However, morphological alterations in GFAP+ and Iba-1+ cells suggest that: i) astrocytes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and the cornu Ammonis 1 regions and ii) microglia in the cornu Ammonis 1 region are responding to infection. Curiously, the effect persisted only in Iba-1+ cells up to 22 days post-infection. An increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines levels and expression was observed, in both the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Also, serum and spleen cytokine levels were increased at 4 days post-infection. At 22 days post-infection, infected and treated mice showed an increase in serum cytokine levels that had homeostatic levels at 155 days post-infection. This dynamic points to both an immune stimulus persistence and a cytokine autoregulation post-infection. Infected mice exhibited acquisition and consolidation memory deficits in behavioral tests early after treatment (22 days post-infection). In conclusion, in a context of sustained systemic inflammation, mild neuroinflammatory alterations of glial cells may be involved in cognitive sequelae following a single episode of non-severe experimental malaria.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Our data indicate that prolonged AHR activation caused toxic endpoints for liver and thymus but was not per se interfering with the host response to infection with the intestinal pathogen C.rodentium. Genetically driven constitutive AHR activation improved resistance to infection, whereas prolonged AHR activation by the pollutant TCDD resulted in delayed clearance of C.rodentium associated with a suppression in antibody production. Combined single cell RNAseq and ATAC-seq analysis provided evidence that TCDD, but not genetic AHR activation, negatively affected dendritic cell functions such as activation, maturation and antigen presentation.

While traditionally employed as an indicator of physiological status, emerging evidence suggests that natural chlorophyll fluorescence (ChlF) may also play unanticipated functional roles in the marine environment. Here, we examine the ChlF emission fields generated by pennate planktonic diatoms, a key phytoplankton group playing a critical role in global biogeochemical cycles. Using cell micromanipulation experiments, we demonstrate that the ChlF emitted by Pseudo-nitzschia fraudulenta (Bacillariophyceae) is markedly anisotropic, a feature attributed to both the cells' elongated morphology and the arrangement of chloroplasts within the cytoplasm. In these diatoms, fluorescence is preferentially emitted in the transapical direction, accounting for up to 35% of total emission. However, peak ChlF intensities occur at the cell apices, suggesting that the silica frustule focuses fluorescent light emission along the longitudinal axis. At elevated cell densities (~106 cells/L), the underwater light field is modulated by the combined effects of ChlF emission anisotropy and the preferential alignment of diatom cells within the water column. Numerical simulations indicate that ChlF intensity can vary by up to 15% depending on whether cells are predominantly aligned (commonly in stratified water columns) or randomly oriented. These results suggest that diatom-driven modulation of the light field through structured ChlF emission may influence microscale optical environments, with potential consequences for processes ranging from intercellular signaling to large-scale phytoplankton dynamics, including remote sensing based assessments of phytoplankton physiology.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Global epistasis was evident in these data, with more fit segregants within each environment exhibiting greater sensitivity to genetic perturbations than less fit segregants. We dissected the genetic basis of this global epistasis by scanning the genome for loci whose effects covary with CRISPRi-induced reductions in population fitness. This approach identified 58 loci that interact with fitness, most of which exhibited larger effects in the absence of genetic perturbations.

With the advent of the VisiumHD platform that measures the full cellular transcriptome in barcoded 2 m capture ''spots'', new approaches are urgently needed that faithfully assign transcripts to individual cells and enable the identification and analysis of cell type or gene expression gradients along complex tissue structures. Here we introduce the Segmentation and Manifold UnRolling Framework (SMURF), a computational tool for the analysis of high-resolution ST data. SMURF introduces a novel ''soft-segmentation'' approach that accurately aggregates and assigns the mRNAs captured and barcoded in each spot to nearby nuclei. mRNAs from multiple capture spots can be assigned to a single nucleus, and conversely, mRNAs from a single capture spot may be partitioned and assigned to multiple neighboring nuclei. We demonstrate that this algorithm achieves single-cell resolution of ST data without requiring single-cell reference data. SMURF is also able to ``unroll'' cells contained in complex tissue structures and place them on standard Cartesian coordinates, thus empowering studies of cellular organization and regional specification. We deployed SMURF in the complex mouse small intestine, revealing the functional organization of the ileal epithelium along the crypt-villus axis for all major epithelial cell types. We used SMURF to investigate an important outstanding question -- how are the functionally important proximal-to-distal gene expression gradients determined during development? Are the gradients hardwired into the stem cells at the base of the crypt, or do tip cells respond to external signals from their environments? We discovered that regionally specific gene programs along the proximal-distal axis accumulate in the epithelial villus tip and that tip cell gene expression is reprogrammed when a segment of the distal small intestine is surgically moved to a proximal location in an adult mouse. These results suggest that luminal environmental signals are a major determinant of regional transcriptional identity. SMURF promises to accelerate the effective use of high-resolution ST data by enabling more accurate segmentation and assignment of mRNAs to cells and by providing a unique toolbox for the analysis of regional transcriptional programs along tissue manifolds.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Both telomeric ends of Chr Y display extensive homology to Chr X, but no homology to the ancestral PAR of placental mammals. Using rat Y BACs probes for FISH on meiotic cells, we show that pairing almost always occurs between the tips of Yq and Xp, which are virtually identical in nucleotide sequence, but contain no protein-coding genes. Homology at the other ends of Chr X and Chr Y is likely the result of a recent transposition of five genes from Xq to Yp. These sequences are only 99.5% identical and pair infrequently, but show signs that it may have been pseudoautosomal in the ancestor of the rat genus. The rat Chr Y sequence presents opportunities for experimental studies of meiotic phenomena in a tractable model organism. The short PAR, with a correspondingly high recombination rate, represents a unique substrate for molecular studies of crossing-over. Likewise, the absence of extensively co-amplified testis gene families on the rat X and Y suggests they might serve as control for the intense competition between selfish elements that completely remodeled the mouse sex chromosomes.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

The vertebrate CarGAP (i.e., Cx-CarGAP), created by genetically fusing connexins with CarHC in mammalian cells, can efficiently block the gap junction channels through AdoB12-induced protein oligomerization, and subsequently reinstate them via green light-induced protein disassembly. We further introduced the CarGAP system (i.e., Inx-CarGAP) to the Drosophila ovary, enabling reversible control over the heterotypic gap junctions formed by innexin2 (Inx2) and innexin4 (Inx4, also known as zero population growth, Zpg), thereby uncovering the roles of gap junctions in stem cell-niche interactions.

Symbolic encoding methods offer a novel way to represent motion trajectories through discrete motifs. Objective: This study explores whether symbolic time-series representations can uncover latent structure in sperm motility data, focusing on patterns of symbolic monotony and entropy. Methods: We applied Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX) to 1176 sperm trajectories and computed motif entropy and dominance across multiple parameterizations (a = 3-7, k = 2-4). Trajectories were embedded using UMAP and evaluated for symbolic convergence. Results: A compact trajectory cluster (82 out of 1176; 7%) consistently emerged across SAX configurations, characterized by very low entropy (median: 0.00) and high motif dominance (median: 0.97), with more than 85% of motifs consisting of the \"DDD\" triplet. The cluster exhibited a markedly negative VSL slope (median: -0.00021), in contrast to non-clustered trajectories (median: +0.00002). No external labels were available to determine functional significance. Conclusions: Symbolic encoding revealed a highly consistent pattern of motion monotony. While these findings may reflect constrained or declining motility, their biological interpretation remains uncertain. Symbolic representations may serve as useful hypothesis-generating tools in the discovery of emergent sperm motility phenotypes.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Therefore, the searching space for immunopeptides is not limited by proteolytic specificity, requiring more sophisticated software algorithms to handle the increased complexity. Despite the widespread use of MS in immunopeptidomics, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of data processing software, making it challenging to identify the optimal solution. In this study, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking of the most widespread/used data-dependent acquisition (DDA)-based software platforms for immunopeptidomics: MaxQuant, FragPipe, PEAKS and MHCquant. The evaluation was conducted using data obtained from the JY cell line using the Thunder-DDA-PASEF method. We assessed each softwares ability to identify immunopeptides and compared their identification confidence. Additionally, we examined potential biases in the results and tested the impact of database size on immunopeptide identification efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that all software platforms successfully identify the most prominent subset of immunopeptides with 1% false discovery rate (FDR) control, achieving medium to high identification confidence correlations. The largest number of immunopeptides were identified using the commercial PEAKS software, which is closely followed by FragPipe, making it a viable non-commercial alternative. However, we observed that larger database sizes negatively impacted the performance of some software platforms more than others.

Although over 100,000 kinase inhibitors have been developed, only a small fraction has achieved FDA approval, primarily due to off-target effects stemming from the high conservation of kinase binding sites. To address this challenge, we present an ensemble learning framework that integrates both chemical and protein-level information to improve the prediction of selective kinase inhibitors. On the compound side, we construct a 1,048-dimensional feature representation encompassing topological fingerprints, drug-like moieties, atomic composition, and stereochemical descriptors. On the protein side, we develop a 1,700-dimensional representation of kinase binding site environments using multiple sequence alignment and evolutionary conservation information. Comprehensive evaluations across 131 human kinases show that the integration of these features significantly improves model performance, achieving 93.6% accuracy on an independent test set. Furthermore, SHAP-based model interpretation reveals that high-impact features correspond to known binding motifs, such as the P-loop, Hinge region, and DFG motif, as confirmed by crystal structure validation. Lastly, we apply the model to a curated dataset of flavonoid-like compounds, identifying potential natural product-derived kinase inhibitors.

Prostate cancer cells leverage this metabolic plasticity to evade therapies targeting the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. For example, nucleotide metabolism plays a critical role in treatment-resistant prostate cancer by supporting DNA replication, DNA damage response and cell fate decisions. Identifying novel regulators of nucleotide metabolism in treatment-resistant cancer that are dispensable for the health of normal cells may lead to new therapeutic approaches less toxic than commonly used chemotherapies targeting nucleotide metabolism. We identify the metabolic enzyme Oxoglutarate Dehydrogenase-Like (OGDHL), named for its structural similarity to the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme Oxoglutarate Dehydrogenase (OGDH), as a regulator of nucleotide metabolism, tumor growth, and treatment-induced plasticity in prostate cancer. While OGDHL is a tumor-suppressor in various cancers, we find that its loss impairs prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor formation while having minimal impact on TCA cycle activity. Loss of OGDHL profoundly decreases nucleotide metabolite pools, induces the DNA damage response marker {gamma}2AX, and alters androgen receptor inhibition-induced plasticity, including suppressing the neuroendocrine markers DLL3 and HES6. Finally, OGDHL is highly expressed in neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC).

We investigated how the cell wall of Arabidopsis rosettes is remodeled during periods of dark-induced starvation in the wild type and in plastidic phosphoglucomutase (pgm) mutants, which suffer from periodic starvation due to starch deficiency. Time-course analysis demonstrated that up to one fifth of the galactose present in leaf cell walls is reversibly released upon starvation, while other cell wall monosaccharides were less affected. An investigation of BETA-GALACTOSIDASE (BGAL) expression and the analysis of bgal mutants indicated that BGAL1 and BGAL4 contribute to the release of cell wall galactose upon starvation. Increased transcript abundance of UDP-GLUCOSE 4-EPIMERASE (UGE) 1 and 3 under starvation proposed an increased flux through the galactose salvage pathway, however an analysis of the UDP- galactose pool in mutant plants indicated redundancy with other UGEs. Simultaneously to galactan degradation, GALACTAN SYNTHASE1 (GALS1) expression was reduced, attenuating the synthesis of new galactan chains. We show that overexpression of GALS1 prevents depletion of the recyclable cell wall galactose pool and is sufficient to rescue impaired penetration resistance to the hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum upon dark-induced and periodic starvation.

In angiosperms, a double fertilization process results in the formation of a diploid embryo and a triploid endosperm, both of which develop within maternal sporophytic integuments. Thus, the seed of angiosperms is a combined structure of three genetically distinct components: embryo, endosperm, and maternal integuments. It has long been assumed that the maternal plant influences embryo development, but there is limited molecular evidence for a direct pathway through which the maternal sporophyte affects embryogenesis. Here we show that secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated upon exosome impairment lead to embryo abortion through a maternal sporophytic effect. Depletion of the core subunit of the RNA-processing exosome RRP45B (CER7) causes globular embryo arrest connected to ectopic post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Seed coat expression of CER7 suppresses seed abortion, demonstrating a maternal sporophytic control of embryo development through an RNA decay safeguard pathway. Our data support a model in which a primary siRNA trigger originates in the maternal integuments of the cer7 seed coat and drives PTGS amplification in reproductive tissues after fertilization, ultimately leading to seed abortion. In addition, our genetic and molecular data suggest that overloading of AGO1 with siRNAs impairs miRNA function, likely leading to embryo arrest.

However, the functional role of these morphologies in substrate-biting fish is not established. Here, we tested the hypothesis that these morphologies function as control surfaces that affect feeding kinematics during biting. To test this hypothesis, we used simplified physical models of substrate-biting fish and examined the role of head, body, and fin morphology in determining feeding kinematics that facilitate the removal of substrate-attached prey. Models simulated the swift lateral movement of the head, previously documented in species biting substrate-attached algae. Using models that capture the natural morphological variation of biters, we tested (i) how different head morphologies affect the speed of the head and (ii) how different body morphologies affect the stability of the body during head movements. We found that the moment of inertia (MOI) of the head and body explained most of the variation in head speed and body displacement. A decrease in head MOI resulted in faster lateral head movements, known to facilitate removal of attached prey. An increase in body MOI, relative to that of the head, stabilized the lateral displacement of the body during bites. Overall, our results suggest that the laterally compressed bodies and tapered snouts function as control surfaces during feeding in substrate-biting fish. We propose that a selective pressure to extend the lateral surface area underlies the prevailing morphological convergence of biting reef fishes.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

We analyzed Tbr1+/- mice, a well-established model of ASD, using proteomic approaches and in vivo calcium imaging. Synaptic and metabolic proteomes were found to be sensitive to Tbr1 haploinsufficiency. Our results also revealed that Tbr1 haploinsufficiency promotes hyperactivation and hyperconnectivity of basolateral amygdala (BLA) neurons, enhancing the activity correlation between individual neurons and their corresponding ensembles. Zinc, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and serine--all nutrients known to regulate synapse formation and activity--were then combined into supplement cocktails and administered to Tbr1+/- mice. This treatment altered synaptic and metabolic proteomes and normalized the activity and connectivity of the BLA in Tbr1+/- mice during social interactions. We further show that although a low dose of individual nutrients did not alter social behaviors, treatment with supplement cocktails containing low-dose individual nutrients improved social behaviors and associative memory of Tbr1+/- mice, implying a synergistic effect of combining low-dose zinc, BCAA, and serine. Moreover, the supplement cocktails also improved social behaviors in Nf1+/- and Cttnbp2+/M120I mice, two additional ASD mouse models.

However, the molecular link between hyperglycemia and axon injury remains unclear. Here, we identify pyruvate kinase M (PKM) as a direct metabolic activator of the NADase SARM1 under high-glucose conditions. Proteomic and biochemical analyses reveal that PKM binds the TIR domain of SARM1 via its C-terminal region, allosterically enhancing NADase activity independently of PKM's glycolytic role. In dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, hyperglycemia strengthens the PKM-SARM1 interaction, driving NAD+ depletion, axonal fragmentation, and sensory dysfunction. Genetic depletion of PKM protects against streptozotocin-induced neuropathy, preserving nerve fiber density, restoring NAD+ levels, and alleviating mechanical allodynia. Most notably, we developed Pep-SP1, a competitive inhibitory peptide derived from residues 645-655 of the SARM1 TIR domain, which selectively disrupts the PKM-SARM1 interaction without impairing PKM metabolism or SARM1 catalytic activity.

J.; Zovkic, I.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that disproportionately impacts women, but underlying mechanisms for sex-divergent outcomes are unknown. Here, we show that the histone variant H2A.Z is a novel sex-specific regulator of AD in human patients and AD model mice. Specifically, H2A.Z binding in chromatin declines in female and increases in male AD patients, indicating opposite patterns of AD-related H2A.Z dysregulation in each sex. These sex differences were recapitulated in the 5xFAD model of AD, in which females accumulated H2A.Z at early disease stages and lost H2A.Z as the disease progressed, suggesting that H2A.Z occupancy shifts with advancing disease. Males showed no change in H2A.Z binding in early disease, but exhibited increased binding as disease progressed, albeit to a lesser extent than females. Consistent with sex-specific H2A.Z dysregulation, H2A.Z depletion produced sex-specific changes in gene expression, whereby H2A.Z was more repressive in female than male mice and in 5xFAD than in WT males, suggesting that H2A.Z's role in transcription is altered with disease state. Moreover, H2A.Z depletion improved memory and AD pathology in females, while impairing memory and worsening pathology in male mice. Together, these data suggest that H2A.Z is protective in males and detrimental in females with AD, with key implications for sex-specific therapeutic targeting of chromatin factors.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

It primarily affects the motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and eventual death of patients. Various factors, such as genetics, environment, age, etc, are involved in the etiopathogenesis of ALS. As ALS is a highly challenging and complex disease that involves various pathogeneses linked with progressive motor neuron degeneration, it is difficult to have a single therapeutic target against this disease. ALS mutants of TDP-43 and FUS are showing slow growth as well as protein aggregation in the cytoplasm in yeast. Our study involves cloning of 38 Drosophila DnaJ domain chaperones and overexpressing them in a yeast ALS model. After the interaction of mutants TDP-43 and FUS with the DnaJ domain chaperones, they were categorized into suppressors and enhancers. The major hits on our screen were CG7872, Hsc70-4, and Mrj, which rescued TDP-43 toxicity by reducing the protein aggregation and slow growth in yeast cells. In the FUS, slow growth and protein aggregation is reduced with the chaperones CG32641 and CG6693, resulting in a lowering of the FUS toxicity. On the other hand, chaperones CG2911, CG2790, and CG8476 in the presence of TDP-43 overexpression, grow more slowly with increasing punctae in yeast cells. These chaperones increase the toxicity of TDP-43. Similarly, in FUS, Hsc20, CG7130, CG2911, and JdpC also showed a slow growth phenotype and increased protein aggregation in yeast cells. These chaperones enhance the toxicity of FUS. This screening will enhance our understanding of ALS, and the chaperones identified in this study can serve as neuroprotective agents for ALS.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

In this preclinical study, we investigated the time-dependent impact of oral nicotine pouch exposure on seizure susceptibility, glymphatic function, and neuroinflammation in mice, and evaluated the therapeutic potential of inhaled cannabidiol (CBD). Using the Racine scale, we found that acute nicotine exposure transiently reduced seizure severity, while chronic exposure significantly exacerbated seizures and impaired glymphatic integrity, as evidenced by downregulation of aquaporin-4 (AQP4). Chronic nicotine also elevated circulating levels of HMGB1 and IL-6, indicating sustained systemic inflammation. Notably, inhaled CBD reversed these pathological changes, reducing seizure severity, restoring AQP4 expression, and normalizing inflammatory markers. Molecular analyses further revealed upregulation of BDNF and c-FOS with chronic nicotine exposure, which was also mitigated by CBD. In conclusion, these findings suggest that while nicotine pouches may confer short-term neurophysiological modulation, chronic use poses significant risks for seizure vulnerability and glymphatic dysfunction. Inhaled CBD demonstrates strong neuroprotective potential and may serve as a promising therapeutic approach for individuals exposed to prolonged nicotine use.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Research has shown that the two stable Li isotopes, which differ in their mass and nuclear spin, can induce distinct effects in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Since sodium (Na+) channels are the primary pathway for Li+ entry into cells, we examined how Li+ affects the current of Na+ channels using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and human iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Our findings indicate that mammalian Na+ channels in both neuronal models studied here display no selectivity between Na+ and Li+, unlike previously reported bacterial Na+ channels. We observed differences between the two neuronal models in three measured parameters (Vhalf, Gmax, z). We saw no statistically significant differences between any ions in SHSY-5Y cells, but small differences in the half-maximum activation potential (Vhalf) between Na+ and 6Li+ and between 7Li+ and 6Li+ were found in iPSC-derived cortical neurons. Although Na+ channels are widely expressed and important in neuronal function, the very small differences observed in this work suggest that Li+ regulation through Na+ channels is likely not the primary mechanism underlying Li+ isotope differentiation.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Despite this potential, only one TCR-T therapy has received FDA approval to date. A key challenge lies in chain mispairing between exogenous therapeutic TCR chains and endogenous TCR chains, which compromises membrane localization efficiency and elevates off-target toxicity risks. While multiple engineering strategies have been developed to enhance TCR surface expression, our systematic evaluation using a novel mispairing assessment platform revealed that conventional approaches may paradoxically exacerbate chain mismatching. Through targeted cysteine mutations that disrupt the native interchain disulfide bonds in TCR constant domains, we achieved a substantial reduction in exogenous-endogenous TCR mispairing. Importantly, these structural modifications preserved both high surface expression level and potent tumor-specific cytotoxicity. This innovative engineering approach establishes a critical foundation for clinical- grade manufacturing of TCR-T therapies with enhanced safety profiles.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

We have recently described that CD20 is localized within a membrane nanocluster harboring the IgD class B cell antigen receptor (IgD-BCR) where it functions as a gatekeeper for the resting state of naive human B lymphocytes. How CD20 exerts its gatekeeper function is not yet known. Using Ramos and human peripheral blood B cells, we show here that the serine/threonine kinase PKC{delta}, constitutively phosphorylates serine residues at the cytosolic tails of CD20. The phosphorylated CD20 becomes a target for 14-3-3 adaptor proteins that link CD20 to the RhoA GDP/GTP exchange factor GEF-H1 and the microtubule (MT) network controlling the stability of the IgD-BCR nanocluster. Binding of anti-CD20 antibodies results in MT disassembly and the replacement of the GEF-H1/CD20 complex by a RhoA-GTP/ROCK1/CD20 complex which drives actomyosin contractility. Our study suggests that CD20 not only maintains the resting state, but also orchestrates the MT/actin switch in active B lymphocytes.

Sensitivity to temperature change varies across life stages, with embryos often being less tolerant to thermal perturbation than adults. Antarctic notothenioid fishes evolved to occupy a narrow, cold thermal regime (-2 to +2C{degrees}) as the high-latitude Southern Ocean (SO) cooled to its present icy temperatures, and they are particularly vulnerable to small temperature changes, which makes them ideal sentinel species for assessing climate change impacts. Here, we detail how predicted warming of the SO may affect embryonic development in the Antarctic bullhead notothen, Notothenia coriiceps. Experimental embryos were incubated at +4{degrees}, a temperature projected for the high-latitude SO within the next 100-200 years under high emission climate models, whereas control embryos were incubated at present-day ambient temperature, ~0{degrees}C. Elevated temperature caused a high incidence of embryonic morphological abnormalities, including body axis kinking/curvature and reduced body size. Experimental embryos also developed more rapidly, such that they hatched 68 days earlier than controls (87 vs. 155 days post-fertilization). Accelerated development disrupted the evolved timing of seasonal hatching, shifting larval emergence into the polar winter when food availability is scarce. Transcriptomic analyses revealed molecular signatures of hypoxia and disrupted protein-folding in near-hatching embryos, indicative of severe cellular stress. Predictive modeling suggested that temperature-induced developmental disruptions would narrow seasonal reproductive windows, thereby threatening population viability under future climate scenarios. Together, our findings underscore the vulnerability of Antarctic fish embryos to higher water temperature and highlight the urgent need to understand the consequences of disruption of this important trophic component on ecosystem stability in the SO.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

GC proliferation and apoptosis are influenced by several genes, with the Kruppel Like Factor 12 (KLF12) gene contributing to the modulation of several cellular activities. Nevertheless, the precise modulatory function of this gene within the context of ovarian GCs remains unelucidated. We cloned the KLF12 gene of New Zealand female rabbits, and evaluated its expression and localization in the ovaries of female rabbits of different ages by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In order to determine the role of KLF12 in ovarian GCs, we used qRT-PCR, WB, CCK-8 and Annexin V-FITC/PI to detect the effect of KLF12 on GCs proliferation and apoptosis. The coding sequence of KLF12 gene of New Zealand female rabbit was predicted and cloned for the first time in this study. The coding region was 1209 bp, encoding 402 amino acids. KLF12 overexpression has a negative effect on the proliferation and cell cycle progression of rabbit GCs. KLF12 knockdown partially rescues GCs proliferation, accelerates GCs cycle progression, and promotes Estradiol (E2) and Progesterone (P) secretion. In addition, KLF12 was also proved to be a key regulator of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in GCs. In conclusion, the study provides evidence that KLF12 plays a pivotal role in the maturation and proliferation of ovarian GCs in female rabbits.

Clonogenic survival assays and a mouse model of oral cancer were used to examine the impact of silenced SPP1 in vitro and in vivo on CDDP sensitivity and tumor progression. Western blotting, cell invasion, functional proteomics RPPA and spatial transcriptomic analyses were performed to identify molecular interactions and metastatic signaling pathways. Results: Targeted suppression of SPP1 improved cisplatin sensitivity, inhibited tumor invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo as well as several metastatic signaling proteins in NRF2-hyperactivated HNSCC. Spatial transcriptomic analysis revealed a potential mechanistic interaction between SPP1, integrins and CD44 receptors in primary and metastatic HNSCC. Spatial annotation and enrichment analyses using HALLMARK revealed gene set signatures of interferon and EMT present in cell clusters with SPP1 expression in both the primary tumor and lung metastases. Finally, increased expression of SPP1 was found to be poor prognostic factor and significantly correlated with NFE2L2/KEAP1 mutational status and higher tumor grade in HNSCC patients.

To investigate the mechanism of PAMD-Ch17 novel anti-leukemic effects, we tested PAMD-Ch17 against a panel of human leukemia cell lines and found that PAMD-Ch17 is effective against a variety of acute leukemias, with T-ALL cell lines being highly sensitive. Surprisingly, CXCR4 knock out T-ALL cells were equally sensitive to PAMD-Ch17. Using a fluorescently tagged PAMD-Ch17, we found that the drug colocalized to the mitochondria. We also found that PAMD-Ch17 induced changes in expression of genes related to mitochondrial function, increased levels of mitochondrial superoxide, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Using seahorse assays, we found that PAMD-Ch17 decreased baseline oxygen consumption, ATP production, and proton leakage. PAMD-Ch17 also decreased baseline extracellular acidification rate, indicating a decrease in overall metabolism. In mouse primary T-ALL but not healthy bone marrow cells, PAMD-Ch17 induced both mitochondrial superoxide and cell death.

This adaptivity can originate in clonal variation of the spreading tumor and is often empowered by epigenetic and molecular reprogramming of cell regulatory circuits. Related to organotropic colonization of metastatic sites are environmentally-sensitive, differential responses of cancer cells to therapeutic attack. Accordingly, understanding the organotropic profile of a cancer and probing the underlying driver mechanisms are of high clinical importance. However, determining systematically the organotropism of one cancer versus the organotropism of another cancer, potentially with the granularity of comparing the same cancer type between patients or tracking the evolution of a cancer in a single patient for the purpose of personalized treatment, has remained very challenging. It requires a host organism that allows observation of the spreading pattern over relatively short experimental times. Moreover, organotropic patterns often tend to be statistically weak and superimposed by experimental variation. Thus, an assay for organotropism must give access to statistical powers that can separate meaningful heterogeneity, i.e., heterogeneity that determines organotropism, from meaningless heterogeneity, i.e., heterogeneity that causes experimental noise. Here we describe an experimental workflow that leverages the physiological properties of zebrafish larvae for an imaging-based assessment of organotropic patterns over a time-frame of 3 days. The workflow incorporates computer vision pipelines to automatically integrate the stochastic spreading behavior of a particular cancer xenograft in tens to hundreds of larvae allowing subtle trends in the colonization of particular organs to emerge above random cell depositions throughout the host organism. We validate our approach with positive control experiments comparing the spreading patterns of a metastatic sarcoma against non-transformed fibroblasts and the spreading patterns of two melanoma cell lines with previously established differences in metastatic propensity. We then show that integration of the spreading pattern of xenografts in 40-50 larvae is necessary and sufficient to generate a Fish Metastatic Atlas page that is representative of the organotropism of a particular oncogenotype and experimental condition. Finally, we apply the power of this assay to determine the function of the EWSR1::FLI1 fusion oncogene and its transcriptional target SOX6 as plasticity factors that enhance the adaptive capacity of metastatic Ewing sarcoma.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

In certain species classified within Pleocyemata, experimental manipulation of IAG signaling has successfully altered both internal and external sexual characteristics, leading to sex reversal. Therefore, IAG is considered a key regulator of male sexual differentiation and maturation and is thought to be a crustacean androgen. In the kuruma prawn Marsupenaeus japonicus (Dendrobranchiata), an important fishery species in Japan, a homologous molecule known as Maj-IAG has been identified. However, its physiological function in males remains poorly understood. In this context, we conducted Maj-IAG knockdown (KD) via RNA interference in juvenile male M. japonicus. Over a 9-week period, Maj-IAG KD significantly inhibited the development of the petasma, male-specific external copulatory structure, and parts of the internal reproductive organs, such as the vas deferens and seminal vesicles. In contrast, somatic growth and testicular development were unaffected by Maj-IAG KD. Histological analysis of the testes revealed no evident abnormalities such as degeneration of testicular structures or abnormal arrest of germ cell differentiation. These findings indicate that Maj-IAG partially governs the development of male secondary sexual characteristics in juveniles and further suggest that once testicular differentiation is initiated, the maintenance and development of the testis proceeds without dependence on Maj-IAG.

Here we extend an existing dynamical model of binocular rivalry to encompass two novel experimental paradigms: a threshold detection variant of binocular rivalry, and tracking continuous flash suppression. Together, these tasks provide complementary measures of the dynamics and magnitude of perceptual suppression.

Little is known about repair of pathways/circuits after traumatic brain injury (TBI), which results in disruption of connectivity. Here we utilize a mouse model of diffuse traumatic axonal injury (Impact-acceleration TBI) in order to explore, for the first time, the evolution of structural and functional changes in the terminal fields of the injured visual system. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons and synapses were genetically labeled via AAV transduction, while anterograde and transsynaptic tracers were used to mark terminals and postsynaptic cells. Functional connectivity and visual integrity were assessed by monitoring c-Fos expression following light stimulation and visual evoked potentials (VEPs). Our findings demonstrate that, although TAI results in approximately a 50% loss of RGC axons and terminals, surviving RGCs generate collateral sprouting, a form of compensatory branching of surviving axons, that restores terminal density to pre-injury levels. Transsynaptic tracing and c-Fos mapping confirmed the reestablishment of connectivity, which was also associated with significant improvements in visual function as measured by pVEPs. Interestingly, the recovery process exhibited sexual dimorphism, with female mice showing delayed or incomplete repair. Moreover, collateral sprouting proceeded normally in Sarm1 knockout mice, evidence of some independence from Wallerian degeneration. Our findings show that collateral sprouting may be an important mechanism of circuit repair in TAI independent of Wallerian degeneration and may represent a promising target for therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

L.; Kurhanewicz, N. A.; Wilson, H. R.; Berg, V.; Libuda, D. E.", "abstract": "Germ cell proliferation and proper genome inheritance are critical for maintaining fertility through generations. To promote proper germ cell development, small RNA pathways employ Argonaute proteins (AGOs) to modulate gene expression and protect against deleterious genomic elements while not silencing against self. Here we identify sexual dimorphisms in localization and function of protein structural features of the Argonaute WAGO-1 that affects sex-specific gene regulation during C. elegans germ cell development. During meiotic prophase I progression, we find that germ granule structural proteins and the PIWI AGO, PRG-1, display dynamic and distinct localization patterns between egg and sperm development which coincide with differential WAGO-1 localization and biophysical properties. Sexually dimorphic functions of specific WAGO-1 protein structural domains underpin these differences. Disruption or modification to the N-terminus intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of WAGO-1 leads to loss of PGL-1 phase separation only during spermatogenesis. Further, we find that these germ granule disruptions are likely due to prolonged association of the IDR with the RNA-binding pocket of WAGO-1. In addition, deletion of the MID and part of the PIWI domains causes male-specific sterility and disruption to WAGO-1 localization with PGL-1 during oogenesis. Finally, we demonstrate that these disruptions to WAGO-1 protein structure dynamically change the mRNA and sRNA landscape of adult males and hermaphrodites, in which the AGOs ALG-3/4 and VSRA-1 are misregulated. Together, these data suggest that WAGO-1 differentially regulates genes during oogenesis versus spermatogenesis, and that these differences in gene regulation may be due to the sex-specific configuration and biophysical properties of WAGO-1 within the germ granule.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

In mice, SHOC1 forms a trimeric complex with the other two ZMM proteins, SPO16 and TEX11, to bind recombination intermediates after strand invasion. Although genetic variants of SHOC1 are clinically associated with meiotic arrest and male infertility, their precise molecular mechanisms and evolutionarily conserved functions in human gametogenesis remain enigmatic. Here, we delineated species-specific divergences between human and mouse SHOC1 complex, and identified a missense variant within the XPF-like domain in SHOC1 (c.A1769G:p.Q590R) that was associated with meiotic arrest and non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). The disorder of the XPF-like domain in SHOC1 impaired DNA double-strand breaks repair by compromising its ability to bind branched DNA structures and the recruitment of M1AP, REDIC1, and ZMM factors to recombination intermediates, ultimately abolishing CO formation. Furthermore, the variant disrupted dynamic 3D chromatin structure in pachytene spermatocytes and induced defects in homologous chromosome synapsis. More importantly, the XPF-like domain in SHOC1 was revealed to prevent autosome intrusion into the sex body compartment, thereby safeguarding critical autosomal loci from meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromatin (MSUC).

Genomic offset approaches aim to predict climate maladaptation by characterising the genomic changes required for populations to maintain their fitness under changing climates. In this study, we assessed the risk of climate maladaptation in European populations of English yew (Taxus baccata), a long-lived tree with a patchy distribution across Europe, the Atlas Mountains, and the Near East, where many populations are small or threatened. We found evidence suggesting local climate adaptation by analysing 8,616 SNPs in 475 trees from 29 European T. baccata populations, with climate explaining 18.1% of genetic variance and 100 unlinked climate-associated loci identified via genotype-environment association (GEA). Then, we evaluated the deviation of populations from the overall gene-climate association to assess variability in local adaptation or different adaptation trajectories across populations and found the highest deviations in low latitude populations. Moreover, we predicted genomic offsets and successfully validated these predictions using fitness proxies assessed in plants from 26 populations grown in a comparative experiment. Finally, we integrated information from current local adaptation, genomic offset, historical genetic differentiation and effective migration rates to show that Mediterranean and high-elevation T. baccata populations face higher vulnerability to climate change than low-elevation Atlantic and continental populations. Our study demonstrates the practical use of the genomic offset framework in conservation genetics, offers insights for its further development, and highlights the need for a population-centred approach that incorporates additional statistics and data sources to credibly assess climate vulnerability in wild plant populations.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Yet, the overall performance of these approaches remains constrained by limitations in prediction accuracy and compatibility with specific data types. Here, we introduce the third version of the KODAMA algorithm, specifically tailored for spatial transcriptomics analysis.

Mitochondrial haplotype analysis confirmed that the patterns aligned with those reported in previous studies, thereby reflecting the diverse genetic composition of this pathogen. The genetic variability of P. infestans, including its reduced sensitivity to fungicides such as metalaxyl, and its ability to overcome host resistance, underscores the importance of understanding its population dynamics. Approximately 61% of the genetic variation was observed between lineages, likely because of the introduction of genetically distinct propagules into infected seeds.

Fibronectin, a provisional extracellular matrix protein enriched at atheroprone sites, enhances endothelial activation and inflammation triggered by oxLDL and disturbed flow. Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to vascular dysfunction, the role of matrix composition in regulating ER stress remains unknown. We show that oxLDL and disturbed flow induce ER stress selectively in endothelial cells adhered to fibronectin, whereas both stimuli fail to induce ER stress in cells on basement membrane proteins. This matrix-specific ER stress response requires integrin activation, as endothelial cells deficient for integrin activation (talin1 L325R mutation) fail to activate ER stress in response to disturbed flow and oxLDL and direct stimulation of integrin activation using CHAMP peptides is sufficient to trigger ER stress. Blunting endothelial expression of fibronectin-binding integrins (5, v) using siRNA prevents ER stress in response to atherogenic stimuli in vitro, whereas endothelial 5 and v deletion reduces ER stress at atheroprone sites in vivo. The mechanisms driving integrin-dependent ER stress remain unclear, since matrix composition does not affect protein translation, unfolded protein accumulation, or superoxide production, and scavenging superoxide (TEMPOL) does not reduce integrin-dependent ER stress. Inhibiting ER stress with TUDCA reduces proinflammatory and metabolic gene expression (bulk RNAseq) but does not prevent NF-{kappa}B activation, a classic proinflammatory transcription factor. Rather, TUDCA prevents activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and c-jun activation, and blocking JNK (SP600126) or c-Jun activity (TAM67) prevents proinflammatory gene expression following both stimuli. Together, these findings offer new insight into how the arterial microenvironment contributes to atherogenesis, with fibronectin-binding integrin signaling promotes ER stress in response to mechanical and metabolic stressors, thereby amplying proinflammatory endothelial activation through JNK-c-Jun signaling.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

These spatial tools, i.e. heuristics, range from everyday practices, such as directional hand gestures to indicate past or future events, to more abstract scientific conceptualizations such as the curving of space-time in the theory of relativity. Despite this widespread spatialization of time, it remains unclear to what extent space is an inherent component of the neural representation of time and its role in monitoring temporal durations. Here, we combine EEG-behavioral methods and neural network models of optimal decision-making to show that space is a late compensatory mechanism of time representation recruited when faster and non-spatial timekeeping mechanisms are suboptimally engaged. EEG analyses reveal a cascade-like process: spatial engagement in timekeeping follows the insufficient non-spatial encoding of time intervals, leading to delayed decisions on their length and slower response selection. Computational modelling further indicates that trial-by-trial fluctuations in the spatialization of time are explained by stochastic variations in the activity of the dopaminergic/noradrenergic (DA/NE) system and its interaction with the anterior cingulate cortex. These findings provide the first clear evidence of when, why, and how the brain recruits spatial mechanisms in the service of temporal processing and demonstrate that non-spatial and spatial timekeeping systems can be dissociated at both behavioural and electrophysiological levels.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

This circulation depends on the anterograde kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 motors and the retrograde dynein-dynactin motor. While kinesin-3 is recruited to DCVs with the aid of the small GTPase Arl8, it is unclear how dynein and kinesin-1 are recruited and regulated. Here we show that DCV motility in Drosophila (fruit flies) depends on the dynein and kinesin-1 adaptor Sunday Driver/dJIP3/4(Syd) and the novel dynein adaptor RUFY. Syd and RUFY bind each other; moreover, Syd binds the DCV-located GTPase Rab2 that controls retrograde DCV transport, and RUFY binds Arl8. Disruption of Rab2, Syd, RUFY, dynein, and the Arl8 activator BORC all produce a similar DCV axonal transport phenotype characterized by axonal accumulation of immobile DCVs and a selective reduction in retrograde DCV flux. Our data suggest a model where dynein is recruited and activated by a complex of Syd and RUFY, which is anchored to DCVs by a Rab2- and Arl8-dependent mechanism. Lastly, we show that loss of Rab2 results in missorting of the DCV membrane proteins VMAT and Synaptotagmin-, similar to the reported effect of Rab2 deletion on the sorting of synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins.

Furthermore, total cell-cell interaction strength increased while the AD risk gene Apoe expression decreased in the specific oligodendrocyte subtype of peptides-treated AD mice. Thus, our findings revealed that the peptides could improve cognition and memory capabilities and serve as promising structural templates for potential drugs against AD.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Typically, rust fungi have narrow host specificity however the pandemic biotype of Austropuccinia psidii has an unusually broad host range causing disease on over 480 myrtaceous species globally. We assembled and analysed a fully phased chromosome-level genome for the pandemic A. psidii and addressed key outstanding questions of its infection biology. Our research revealed a conserved rust fungal karyotype of 18 haploid chromosomes, in line with fungi for distantly related cereal rusts. We observed chromosomal re-assortment between the two nuclei, with one nucleus carrying 19 and the other 17 chromosomes. The synteny of universal single-copy orthologs is mostly maintained with the distantly related rust fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. In contrast, nucleotide composition and methylation profiles of A. psidii are distinct compared to rust fungi with smaller genome sizes that have not undergone massive transposable element expansions. Our analysis of mating type loci supports a tetrapolar mating system for A. psidii with a novel finding of expanded numbers of pheromone peptide precursors. We show that infection dynamics of A. psidii are consistent on four different susceptible host species separated by 65 mya of evolution and that transcriptional regulation during infection reveals two distinct waves of gene expression in early and late infection, including allele-specific expression of candidate effectors. Together, these findings enhance the understanding of the genome biology and pathology of A. psidii, while also providing a valuable resource for future research on this serious rust pathogen.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

To explore its physiological responses to extreme cold, uncover functional genes, and clarify their ecological roles, efficient genetic tools are essential. However, existing genetic manipulation methods in Pseudoalteromonas rely on traditional homology-based recombination, which is inefficient and time-consuming. Consequently, improving editing efficiency is crucial for advancing both basic research and applied potential. Here, we introduced the CRISPR/Cas9 system into Pseudoalteromonas for the first time, and conducted an extensive investigation into the application of the Type II CRISPR/Cas9 system for gene editing in Pseudoalteromonas fuliginea, a representative species thriving in the frigid polar oceans. To validate the feasibility of the CRISPR/Cas system in P. fuliginea, multiple genes were selected as targets and confirmed the gene editing effects through phenotypic changes or gene expression. We have successfully achieved both gene knockouts and insertions in P. fuliginea, encompassing the deletion of genes such as fliJ, indA, and genes encoding Pf sRNAs, as well as the in vivo insertion of 3xflag and the gfp gene. The average CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing efficiency in P. fuliginea exceeded 70% (range: 73.3%-95.8%), which is significantly higher than the traditional homology-based approach (less than 0.1%). In summary, we developed an efficient CRISPR/Cas9-based editing system in P. fuliginea, which can be utilized to accelerate the development of Pseudoalteromonas as a model system for addressing fundamental questions related to extreme environmental adaptation and to fulfill its potential biotechnological applications.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

This study aims to develop a quantitative, high-throughput system to assess EMT-mediated plasticity, which can inform therapeutic strategies for metastatic cancers. To accomplish this, we developed Plastimos, a semi-automated imaging analysis pipeline. This framework utilizes time-series images to track live cells through deep learning-based segmentation and employs a greedy algorithm to map cell trajectories, enabling the extraction of cellular phenotypic features. These features are used to study the EMT-mediated plasticity state of cells in response to the well-known EMT-inducing factors EGF and TGF-{beta}1. We selected two breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, representing classical epithelial-like and mesenchymal-like cell. The pipeline assigns a Plasticity Index based on various parameters, including motility, morphology, and proliferation, thus providing a quantitative estimate for the plasticity of deviating from the epithelial state.

J.; Sheridan, S. D.; Perlis, R.

In particular, there has been little investigation of how medications like clozapine and olanzapine modulate human non-neuronal cells, including astrocytes and microglia. Recent postmortem and serum-based studies suggest that schizophrenia etiology involves dysregulated cellular communication through extracellular vesicles (EVs). Astrocytes are a major source of these EVs and are strongly implicated in the etiology of schizophrenia by convergent data from human postmortem, brain imaging, RNA-sequencing, and genome-wide association studies. We hypothesized that clozapine and olanzapine can affect microglia biology indirectly via astrocytic secretion of EVs. We used in vitro cellular models with primary human astrocytes and PBMC-derived microglial-like cells to investigate the downstream impact of isolated astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs) on microglial phenotypes relevant to schizophrenia, including microglial phagocytosis, motility, and morphology. To model microglia-mediated synaptic pruning in vitro, we utilized image-based quantification of microglia engulfment of isolated human synaptosomes. We found that treatment with ADEVs reduced microglial synaptosome phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner. This reduction was reversed upon addition of ADEVs isolated from astrocytes treated with norclozapine or olanzapine. ADEVs isolated from clozapine-treated astrocytes increased microglial motility, indicating that clozapine alters microglial surveillance activity without affecting phagocytosis through these ADEVs. Together, these results suggest that atypical antipsychotics have distinct and indirect impact on microglia biology mediated by ADEVs. These results highlight a potentially critical role for ADEVs in regulating glial cell communication and suggest they may be promising therapeutic targets for next-generation antipsychotic development.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Understanding these interactions is essential for developing sustainable fertilization strategies that balance agricultural productivity with environmental protection. This study examined the effects of mineral and organic fertilizers (OFs) on N transformations and evaluated the efficiency of the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP) in mitigating N2O losses. Results showed that OFs exhibited variable impacts on N2O emissions depending on their composition and C/N ratio. DMPP effectively reduced nitrification-driven N2O emissions, particularly in treatments with high ammoniacal N content. However, its efficiency was limited with animal-based OFs, suggesting a complex interaction between fertilizer properties and inhibitor effectiveness. DMPP had not direct impact on soil microbial diversity but specifically targeted the Nitrosomonaceae family and Nitrospira class. Beyond synthetic inhibitors, biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) emerged as a promising alternative, which we explored using rhizospheric soils from wheat landrace Persia 44 and white mustard (cv.

Surprisingly, genome analysis revealed that these six strains each carry an 80-kbp linear plasmid. Linear plasmids were so far not identified in this bacterial family or other bacteria within the class Alphaproteobacteria. The ends of all six plasmids identified in this study have a hairpin structure with covalently closed ends. The plasmid sequences showed a high degree of homology, clearly indicating their common ancestry. Database searches led to the identification of additional linear plasmids in previously published Rhizobiaceae genome assemblies that were not previously recognized to have linear plasmids, suggesting that these replicons may be more widespread.

We aimed to evaluate the efficiency of whole exome sequencing (WES) and single-cell DNA sequencing (scDNA-seq) for determining clonal heterogeneity and evolution in AML induced by treatment, assessing strengths and limitations of each technology. Methods We conducted WES and scDNA-seq on samples from 6 patients with AML, including sequential samples from four patients. We identified somatic variants, clonal composition and phylogeny using both technologies and compared the results. Results WES detected more variants and clones due to broader coverage, while scDNA-seq provided clonality results for targeted genes revealing zygosity and rare clones. Both techniques missed clinically important variants, posing challenges for clinical application. However, they identified similar founding clones and strong correlation of variant allele frequencies and clonal prevalences. Conclusions As both technologies can overlook variants, multiple technologies should be utilized to understand clonality in heterogeneous diseases such as AML.

However, current mutational signatures do not distinguish the two independent steps that generate SBSs: the initial DNA damage followed by erroneous repair. To address this modelling gap we developed DAMUTA, a hierarchical Bayesian probabilistic model that infers separate signatures for each process, and captures their sample-specific interaction. We applied DAMUTA to 18,974 pan-cancer whole genome sequencing mutation catalogues from 23 cancer types and show that tissue-specificity in mutation patterns is driven largely by variability in damage processes. We also show that misrepair processes are predictive of DNA damage response deficiencies, and unlike existing approaches, DAMUTA distinguishes damage from misrepair contributions, and we demonstrate significant improvements over a mutational-burden baseline or signatures from the COSMIC database. Our analysis reveals a shared pan-cancer pattern of early clonal transition-mutations which shifts to a more uniform substitution pattern consistent with increased reliance on translesion synthesis for damage tolerance. DAMUTA thus generates a compact set of signatures which resolves redundancies of current signature models, disentangles the effects of DNA damage and misrepair processes, and facilitates improved stratification of tumours, while providing a framework towards a unified pan-cancer model of the cellular response to DNA damage.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Recent advancements in protein language models have paved the way for significant progress across various domains, including protein function and structure prediction, multiple sequence alignments and mutation effect prediction.

However, biological understanding reveals that protein-protein interactions span entire genomic regions, underscoring the limitations of focusing solely on individual proteins. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that extends the context size of transformer models across the entire viral genome. By training on large genomic fragments, our method captures long-range interprotein interactions and encodes protein sequences with integrated information from distant proteins within the same genome, offering substantial benefits in various tasks. Viruses, with their densely packed genomes, minimal intergenic regions, and protein annotation challenges, are ideal candidates for genome-wide learning.

This local mimicry phase propagates region-specific epithelial signaling into the mesenchyme, producing distinct boundaries that anchor mesenchymal cell condensations. As NCM cells accumulate, cells within condensations undergo morphological and molecular homogenization, erasing regional differences in protein expression and restoring cellular multipotency. These cycles of transient specialization and homogenization - driven by universal processes of cell proliferation and migration - enable NCM cells to reconcile location-specific anchoring signals with stemness needed for ongoing regional specification of growing beak.

How this profound change in axial patterning evolved and what it implied for BMP's developmental role remains elusive. Here, we studied four annelid species and combined disruption of the BMP and Activin/Nodal pathways with transcriptomics and blastomere deletions to demonstrate that BMP is ancestrally downstream of ERK1/2 and promotes dorsoventral development in Spiralia. Importantly, this signalling hierarchy is lost in annelids that secondarily transitioned into a maternally controlled, autonomous development. While some, like Capitella teleta, use Activin/Nodal, Platynereis dumerilii relies on BMP to establish dorsoventral polarity only in the head.

We therefore estimated the safe concentration (SC) of linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS) by investigating the relationship between benthic communities detected via environmental RNA (eRNA) and environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding and the water quality in a river contaminated with LAS. Non-metric multidimensional scaling of benthic communities detected via eRNA indicated significant differences between contaminated and non-contaminated sites, and redundancy analysis showed significant correlation between the benthic communities and LAS concentration. These results demonstrate that eRNA is more sensitive than eDNA for capturing the community changes that result from LAS contamination. No significant differences were observed in biodiversity indices between the highest LAS concentration site and non-contaminated site; thus, the SC was estimated at >47 ug/L. The results suggest that, although hazard assessment using the assessment factor (AF) leads to conservative estimation of the effects of chemicals because the predicted no-effect concentration in previous studies is lower than the SC, hazard assessment based on the response of biological communities using eRNA metabarcoding can refine such ecological assessments, developing the environmental management standards to achieve nature-positive goals.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Solving three core challenges in transient dynamics analysis of matrix population models", "doi": "10.1101/2025.05.29.656837", "authors": "Hinrichsen, R. A.", "abstract": "1. Populations are at the mercy of random disturbances large and small and rarely, if ever, converge on predicted long-term behaviours. Therefore, when using matrix population models, ecologists study the dynamics of populations that depart from stable distributions. Necessary for such studies are indices that gauge transient dynamics, which are short-term population fluctuations away from asymptotic trajectories. Conventional indices of transient dynamics present three core challenges: they are distorted by abundant stages of low value (usually immature stages), they are scale dependent, and they conflate transient and asymptotic responses. 2. I develop a new analytical framework for transient dynamics that overcomes these challenges. To solve distortion and scale dependence, I balance a population projection matrix (PPM) by its reproductive values ('Fisher balancing') or, alternatively, its stable stage distribution ('Demetrius balancing'). To disentangle transient and asymptotic dynamics, I strip a PPM of its output in the direction of its stable stage distribution, resulting in a 'transient' PPM. I develop indices of transient dynamics that gauge the 'size' of a transient PPM using reactivities defined by matrix norms. Among these indices is a new 'coefficient of transient response' (COTR) that represents the fraction of the sum of squares of the total response that is explained by the transient response. In addition to the indices of transient dynamics that apply directly to PPMs, the framework also includes case-specific indices of transient dynamics that arise from a specified initial stage vector. 3. Using a dataset of 6,332 PPMs retrieved from the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database, I compared the new analytical framework with the conventional framework without balancing, focusing mainly on transient responses estimated by COTR. The new framework dramatically changed the rankings of PPMs from the least to the greatest transient dynamics. Spearman correlation between COTR of standardised PPMs and that of balanced PPMs was weak (less than or equal to 0.25). This change in rankings led to new inferences about which taxonomic orders were least or most prone to transient dynamics. 4. By solving three core challenges, the new framework produces a clearer and more robust portrait of transient dynamics.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Members of Siphisia serve as larval hosts for endangered Lepidoptera and are widely used in traditional medicine. Despite its ecological and ethnobotanical significance, Siphisia systematics remains unresolved due to limited genomic resources and insufficient phylogenetic signal across previously sampled loci. Here, we present a phylogenomically informed framework for Siphisia, integrating 46 newly collected accessions and seven public datasets across 44 taxa. Using genome skimming (30 times coverage) and HybPiper, we recovered Angiosperms353 nuclear loci, including supercontigs, for phylogenetic reconstruction via concatenation and coalescent approaches. The resulting species trees resolve seven strongly supported monophyletic clades, each defined by distinct biogeographic patterns and morphological synapomorphies. Comparative plastome analyses from de novo assemblies explored quadripartite structure, plastid phylogeny, GC content, and gene synteny. Cytonuclear discordance was concentrated in species-rich Asian clades, while hybridization signals were rare and limited to deep backbone nodes in North American lineages. These results indicate that incomplete lineage sorting, rather than introgression, accounts for most gene species tree conflicts and likely reflects strong reproductive isolation following speciation. We also revise a previously taxonomically ambiguous complex, the now well-supported A. versicolor species group: based on integrated phylogenomic and morphological evidence. Within this group, we describe five previously unrecognized cryptic species and identify a novel pollination syndrome involving floral adaptations for pollinator filtering. This syndrome may contribute to prezygotic isolation and recent diversification, and it challenges the prevailing assumption that Aristolochia pollination is universally governed by a trapping and release mechanism, suggesting this model may not apply to subg.

Beta cells demonstrated pronounced stress-induced reprogramming, with the emergence of proliferative and dysfunctional subsets. Alpha and delta cell fractions declined under HFD, despite increased polyhormonal biosynthesis, suggesting functional rather than numerical adaptation. Immune profiling showed robust expansion of proinflammatory M1 macrophages and upregulation of NF-{kappa}B and chemotaxis pathways, particularly at 16 weeks. Notably, cell-cell communication analyses revealed diet-specific disruption in signaling networks. Under HFD conditions, intercellular communication among beta cells, macrophages, and delta cells was markedly altered, leading to the disruption of key signaling pathways such as the gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) and major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC-I). Notably, C-C motif chemokine ligand 27A (Ccl27a) expression and chromatin accessibility were significantly altered in a distinct subpopulation of beta cells under HFD condition, indicative of a niche-specific regulatory mechanism.

Trypsin is the gold-standard protease for bottom-up proteomics, though its cleavage specificity limits peptide identification, depending on the protein sequence. In addition, its optimal pH is weakly alkaline, which can cause modification artifacts such as deamidation. We hypothesized that these limitations might be overcome by using protease type XIII (P13ase) from Aspergillus saitoi, which is active at low pH. P13ase has been used for protein structural analysis by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, but its cleavage preferences have not been clarified. Here, we show that P13ase primarily cleaves the C-terminal side of Lys, Arg, and Leu, and the optimal P13ase digestion conditions for bottom-up proteomics are pH 3.5, 37C for 60 min. Under these conditions, sequence coverage of more than 90% was achieved for several proteins in HeLa cell extracts, which is unachievable with trypsin.

Since T cell states did not define resistance (GvL-r), we hypothesized that leukemic molecular pathways determine resistance. Here, we link ASXL1 mutation status through whole exome and targeted mutation panel sequencing in two independent cohorts (78% (7/9) of non-responders and 0% (0/10) of responders) to HLA-I suppression through scRNA-seq of 138,152 myeloid cells. We identify enrichment in progenitor cell identities, notably cells enriched in the LSC17 signature in non-responders and HLA-I but not HLA-II suppression. This was confirmed in two external single cell cohorts in CMML and AML. To directly test the hypothesis that ASXL1 mutations may suppress HLA-I, we CRISPR corrected the endogenous ASXL1 mutation, Y591X, in K562 (K562m). Wildtype reversion (K562c) increased HLA-I expression at the RNA and protein level. Epigenetic profiling by CUT&RUN demonstrated increased presence of H3K4me3, but no change in H3K27me3. Prolonged treatment with EZH2i could restore HLA-I levels in K562m cells. K562c and K562m were also used to prime antigen specific T-cells to test T-cell cytotoxicity. Primed T-cells preferentially killed K562c vs K562m without and with IFN{gamma} pre-treatment, though EZH2i rendered K562m equally susceptible to T cell killing as K562c. In summary, we integrated molecular analyses with immuno-functional studies to define a novel oncogenetic pathway of immune evasion.

Therefore, the search for new therapeutic targets is essential to enhance patient prognosis. There is evidence suggesting that Hook2, an adaptor protein involved in microtubule transport, may play a role in cancer, particularly ovarian cancer. This study examines the role of HOOK2 in the progression of ovarian tumors. The findings reveal that a decrease in HOOK2 levels leads to diminished growth and cellular migration in ovarian cancer cells, impeding the in vivo formation of tumors. The reduction of HOOK2 is associated with both an increase in endoplasmic reticulum stress and an elevation in cell death, the latter likely caused by the activation of the unfolded protein response. Moreover, the study observes that the decrease in HOOK2 diminishes the properties of cancer stem cells in ovarian cancer, possibly due to the increase in cell death specifically found within these stem cells. Given the profound impact of reduced HOOK2 levels on ovarian cancer cells, this gene emerges as a promising therapeutic strategy for treating ovarian cancer patients.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is thought to play an important role in M{Phi} phenotype and functionality, but studies report conflicting net influences suggesting dependence on disease context and downstream signaling. Here, we tested the impact of M{Phi} with constitutive mTORC1 activation induced by targeted deletion of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) on cardiac responses to I/R injury. Methods/Results: Myeloid TSC2 depleted (M{Phi}TSC2-/-) mice were generated by crossing Lys2Cre x TSC2flx/flx. Bone-marrow derived M{Phi}TSC2-/- vs control M{Phi} had basal increased mTORC1 and reduced mTORC2 activity. M{Phi}TSC2-/- were differentially responsive to stimulation by lipopoly-saccharide/IFN-{gamma} or IL-4 in vitro, and all disparities were prevented by rapamycin confirming the model. In vivo, M{Phi} TSC2-/- mice were strongly protected against I/R injury, with minimal change in ejection fraction, less LV dilation, hypertrophy, lung edema, or activation of stress/pro fibrotic genes. Mice pre-treated with anti-LY6G Ab to deplete neutrophils were still similarly protected, suggesting that the impact was primarily related to M{Phi}. M{Phi}TSC2-/- mice had less myocardial pro-inflammatory macrophages (CCR2+MHC-IIhi), LY6C+ monocytes, neutrophils, and CD8+ T cells 5 days post-I/R, and fewer CCR2+ but more CCR2- M{Phi} 2 weeks post I/R. Both M{Phi}TSC2-/- in vitro and in vivo post I/R phenotypes were converted to WT by rapamycin, supporting mTORC1 dependence. Lastly, synthesis of glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), a principally M{Phi} anti-inflammatory secreted protein protective against myocardial infarction was enhanced in M{Phi}TSC2-/- macrophages and hearts following I/R in an mTORC1 dependent manner. Conclusion: Constitutive macrophage-specific mTORC1 activation via TSC2 deletion reduces pro-inflammatory cell infiltration, increases GPNMB protein expression and preserves heart function following I/R injury. Rapamycin eliminates these effects. These results identify a cardioprotective mTORC1-GPNMB signaling nexus in M{Phi} in vivo.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

We previously characterized a GxxxG motif in the CD225 domain of human IFITM3 that mediates its multimerization, which is essential for the reduction of membrane fluidity by IFITM3 and for its antiviral activity against Influenza A virus. Here, using an unbiased approach coupling immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry, we show that the GxxxG motif is also important for the interaction of IFITM3 with other proteins, including IFITM1. While IFITM1 is primarily regarded as a cell surface protein that restricts the entry of viruses fusing at the plasma membrane, this model is based mostly on overexpression studies and is at odds with some studies showing that it can restrict endocytic viruses. Here, we show that endogenous IFITM1 and IFITM3 co-reside in membranes of acidic late endosomes and lysosomes (endolysosomes) and form a protein-protein complex as determined by co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. Knockdown of endogenous IFITM3 resulted in enhanced localization of IFITM1 at the plasma membrane, indicating that IFITM3 promotes IFITM1 localization to endolysosomes. To assess the antiviral protection conferred by endogenous IFITM1 and IFITM3 against viruses fusing at endolysosomal membranes, we measured cell entry mediated by the Influenza A fusogen hemagglutinin (HA). While knockdown of IFITM3 significantly boosted HA-mediated entry, combined knockdown of both IFITM3 and IFITM1 boosted entry even further.

In compulsive mice, morphine fragmented the microbiota networks which subsequently reorganized to form robust novel connections.

In the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, the rhythm generated by a molecular pacemaker is converted into a global transcriptional oscillation by the central regulator RpaA. Mutants in RpaA and other components have been instrumental in elucidating the clock's molecular architecture and physiological role. Extensive evidence suggests that one of the central functions of circadian regulation is to prevent the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during nighttime. However, circadian mutants are unable to grow under natural day/night cycles and require constant illumination, hindering our ability to study the clock function during the night, a phase where circadian regulation is critical for redox homeostasis. Here, we show that the darkness lethality phenotype of circadian mutants can be overcome by high CO2 levels. When grown under a 3% CO2 atmosphere, RpaA-null mutants exhibited growth rates similar to the wt. An analysis of the ROS levels under different CO2 and light intensity conditions revealed carbon scarcity to be the most significant contributor to redox stress. Nighttime ROS accumulation can be modulated by CO2 abundance, an observation that will allow the characterization of heretofore lethal mutants in circadian regulation. The dispensability of the circadian clock in a high CO2 environment suggests that the clock may have evolved as an adaptation to the decrease in atmospheric CO2 levels that occurred after the Great Oxygenation Events, in the Paleoproterozoic era.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

The nuclear receptor NR1D1 is pivotal in regulating circadian rhythms and plays a significant role in inflammation and metabolism. This study investigates the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of the NR1D1 agonist SR9009 on obesity-related UC. Methods: We established a mouse model of obesity-induced UC utilizing a high-fat diet alongside dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). 32 male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: control (DZ), high-fat diet (GZ), obesity associated UC model group (UC), and SR9009 intervention group (JD), with eight mice each. We evaluated body weight, blood lipids, colonic tissue alterations, IL-1{beta}, IL-18, macrophage polarization, and NR1D1 expression levels. Results: Mice in the UC group demonstrated significantly elevated body weight, spleen index, TG, CHOL and inflammatory markers (P<0.01). Pathological scores of colonic tissues increased markedly (P=0.000), with a rise in M1 macrophages (CD68?) and a decline in M2 macrophages (CD206+) (P<0.001). NR1D1 expression was notably downregulated (P<0.01). Post-SR9009 intervention, the JD group showed significantly reduced serum TG and CHOL levels (P=0.001, 0.011), IL-1{beta} and IL-18 (P<0.001), improved colonic pathology (P=0.000), a decrease in M1 macrophages, an increase in M2 macrophages, and an enhanced M1/M2 ratio (P<0.001).

We hypothesized that this would enable more comprehensive and less error-prone analysis of immunopeptidomes at minimal costs in duty-cycle. First, we optimized ETD/EThcD methods using an elastase-digested cell lysate, as this contains peptides of similar length and charge distributions to immunopeptides. Next, we compared HCD and EThcD on immunopeptidomes originating from three cell lines with distinct HLA-I complexes that present peptides with varying physicochemical properties. We demonstrate that the new instrument not only enables efficient and fast ETD reactions, but when combined with collision-based supplemental activation, i.e. EThcD, also consistently increases the sequence coverage and identification of peptide sequences, otherwise missed by using solely HCD. We reveal several of the biochemical properties that make HLA peptides preferably identifiable by EThcD, with internal Arg residues being one of the most dominant determinants. Finally, we demonstrate the power of EThcD for the identification and localization of HLA peptides harboring post-translational modifications, focusing here on HLA Arg mono-/di-methylation. We foresee that this new instrument with efficient EThcD capabilities enhances not only immunopeptidomics analysis, but also analysis of peptides harboring post-translational modifications and de novo sequencing.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

We use X-ray crystallography for structure determination of Rbr to probe the capacity and specificity of metal binding. BpRbr lacks the rubredoxin moiety found in canonical Rbrs from anaerobic lineages, and we demonstrate that BpRbr also possesses a domain-swapped dimer, which has functional implications for its putative role in oxidative stress response. We also carry out in crystallo spectroscopic assessment of BpRbr with various metals, using energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. We observe that samples can contain metals other than those supplied in crystallization conditions, and developed a strategy of utilizing EDX spectroscopy to select those samples with single metal incorporation for downstream diffraction data collection.

S.; Hullfish, T. J.; Baxter, J. R.", "abstract": "The Achilles tendon is composed of three distinct fascicle bundles, or subtendons, each originating from the head of one of the three triceps surae muscles. In a healthy tendon, these subtendons slide relative to each other during muscle contractions. This subtendon sliding is reduced in older adults and younger adults who suffer an Achilles tendon injury. However, subtendon sliding is challenging to quantify in low-load scenarios that are critical for monitoring subtendon biomechanics in patients with mechanically compromised tendons, like following an Achilles tendon rupture and repair surgery. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable method to characterize subtendon behavior in vivo using combined transverse plane ultrasound imaging and neuromuscular electrical stimulation of individual gastrocnemii. We used a Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi point tracking algorithm to quantify tendon displacement during isolated muscle stimulations. Next, we applied k-means clustering to characterize heterogeneous subtendon behavior within the tendon cross section. The tendon cross section displayed differential displacement patterns depending on the stimulated muscle (p<0.0001), and these displacements differed along the free tendon during lateral gastrocnemius stimulations (p=0.004). These results reflect possible differences in load-sharing between adjacent subtendons and differing muscle-tendon dynamics among the triceps surae muscles. Finally, this method confirmed bilaterally symmetric subtendon behavior and demonstrated high inter-session reliability (ICC>0.83). Overall, this study furthers our understanding of differential muscle-tendon dynamics of individual Achilles subtendons both within the tendon cross section and along the free tendon. Future work will apply this method to injured populations to develop biomarkers of altered subtendon function.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Adipocyte hypertrophy is a hypothesized driver of insulin resistance, but current methods for quantifying adipocyte size are invasive.

Monte Carlo simulations confirmed the method's accuracy across a physiologic range of adipocyte sizes (20 - 150 m) and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR > 40). We applied this technique to the epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of rats using in vivo 4.7T and ex vivo 11.7T MRI. Adipocyte sizes derived from diffusion MRI showed good agreement with histology, with minor systematic underestimation corrected by empirical factors. This approach does not require complex modeling or high diffusion weighting, increasing its translatability to the laboratory and clinical settings.

Aim: To develop a multimodal system capable of simultaneous phosphorescence lifetime imaging scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (PLIM-SLO) and visible light optical coherence tomography (VIS-OCT) to capture capillary-level oxygen partial pressure (pO2) and structural volumes in rodents. Approach: C57BL/6 mice were imaged by VIS-OCT with high-definition (10 kHz raster) and Doppler (100 kHz circular) protocols. Phosphorescent probe Oxyphor 2P was retro-orbitally injected to enable intravascular PLIM-SLO imaging (200 s pixel dwell time), while a tunable lens was used to adjust the focal depth. The extracted phosphorescence lifetimes were used for pO2 calculation. Simultaneous imaging utilized a shared imaging path and synchronized data collection. Results: VIS-OCT images revealed detailed anatomy and Doppler shifts, while PLIM-SLO provided capillary pO2 at multiple depths. A hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve related retinal arterial pO2 to systemic oxygen saturation as inhaled oxygen was varied. Registered simultaneous images were captured and pO2 was empirically adjusted for the combined excitation.

Imaging approaches that can accurately and simultaneously track primary tumor growth, metastatic dissemination, and host cachexia over time are lacking. Here, we report an optimized dual-contrast micro-computed tomography (microCT) protocol for longitudinal imaging in orthotopic murine models of PDAC. This method enables high-resolution, volumetric quantification of orthotopic primary tumors, liver and lung metastases, and paraspinal skeletal muscle, providing a dynamic view of both tumor and host physiology. MicroCT primary tumor measurements strongly correlated with endpoint tumor weights and outperformed 2D ultrasound in early detection and volumetric accuracy, particularly for small or irregularly shaped tumors. This platform revealed heterogeneous metastatic kinetics across PDAC models and uncovered early, heterogeneous onset of skeletal muscle wasting, a hallmark of cancer cachexia. Notably, this protocol mimics clinical CT surveillance by enabling opportunistic cachexia assessment from tumor imaging datasets and offers substantial advantages over destructive endpoint analyses. Further, microCT radiation had no effect on our model endpoints. By capturing the temporal dynamics of tumor progression and host response, dual contrast microCT serves as a powerful translational platform for preclinical PDAC research and therapeutic testing.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Many methodologies have improved the quality of biomarker research toward this aim; however, few capture whether checkpoint proteins and genes are actively functioning, termed checkpoint interactions, in an individual. Our team has created novel methodology to directly quantify checkpoint interactions in the tumour-immune microenvironment (TiME) and have early data supporting that this approach better predicts patients outcomes in melanoma. We performed digital spatial profiling (DSP) with Lunaphore-COMET of PD1 in pre- and post-treatment melanoma tumours from patients undergoing standard neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Three treatment response categories were utilised: responder, partial-responder and non-responder. The functional oncology mapping (FuncOmap) of the PD1-PDL1 interactions of the same tissue sections revealed, via their individual violin plots, the heterogeneity of the interactive states of PD1-PDL1. FuncOmap, significantly enhances spatial resolution to 30^106 PD1-PDL1 interactive state data points to produce global violin plots pre-and post-neoadjuvant ICB. The global plots show significantly higher checkpoint interaction, ie. failed checkpoint blockade, in non-responder tissue post-treatment. The co-expressions of PD1 versus PDL1 did not show any correlation pre- or post- treatment. By exploiting an entirely new computational framework and a pattern matching algorithm, we directly mapped, the interactive states of PD1-PDL1 on the COMET PD1 expression image, demonstrating no correlation between high expression of COMET-PD1 and the corresponding interactive states. Our new computational spatial platform, FuncO:TiME, successfully maps functional states of immune checkpoints directly onto expression-based DSP of the tumour-immune microenvironment (TiME).

H.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of pain and disability worldwide, there is a lack of models to probe the separable mechanism of OA structural damage and knee pain. We previously identified that deletion of complement factor D (FD) results in increased pressure-pain hyperalgesia despite cartilage protection after destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery. However, how these discordant OA phenotypes manifest is not understood. We employed a novel targeted lipidomics approach to elucidate the role of eicosanoids in FD-mediated pain. We hypothesize that the absence of Cfd (FD-/-) will protect cartilage but cause increased pressure-pain hyperalgesia and eicosanoid dysregulation that persists throughout OA development. METHODS Male and female FD-/- and wild-type (WT) mice were challenged with DMM or remained naive (n=5-11/group) at 16 weeks old. Pressure-pain hyperalgesia was measured bi-weekly for 8 weeks post-DMM. A second cohort was evaluated at 2 weeks post-DMM (n=6-10/group) to investigate DMM injury response. Structural damage was scored using the Modified Mankin system. To determine changes in eicosanoid profiles, serum and synovial fluid samples were analyzed via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Statistical analysis was performed with unpaired t-test, two-way, or three-way ANOVA with Sidaks posthoc test. Statistical significance is defined as p<0.05. RESULTS In contrast to WT mice, FD-/-showed no significant differences in Modified Mankin scores 8 weeks post-DMM. As expected, FD-/- hyperalgesia levels persisted until 8 weeks post DMM, similar to WT. Changes in eicosanoid profiles of pain-associated factors in FD-/- when compared to WT were found in the synovial fluid at 2 weeks and the serum at 8 weeks post-DMM. CONCLUSION The absence of Cfd drives knee hyperalgesia in male and female mice at 2 weeks-post DMM and persists through an 8-week observation period despite observing cartilage protection. Changes of eicosanoid profiles at both time points suggest that FD drives pain acutely, and the hyperalgesia phenotype emerges early in response to DMM injury, elucidating the role of the alternative complement in mediating OA pain and structural damage.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

The SA-JA pathways often interact antagonistically with the induction of one, leading to the suppression of the other. However, the effect of combined SA/JA concentrations on plant responses is unknown. Here, we show transcriptional responses specific to combinations of SA and JA concentrations and develop transcriptomic biomarkers to estimate SA/JA response states. Combinatorial treatments with eight concentrations of SA and JA, combined with large-scale transcriptome analysis, revealed 43 different expression patterns, including not only well-known antagonistic responses but also responses specific to combinations of SA/JA concentrations. Notably, the expression of CYP94B3, a key enzyme involved in JA-Ile turnover, was finely tuned by specific SA/JA concentration combinations being induced under high SA conditions in a JA dose-dependent manner. In addition, the expression peaks of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis genes were found at approximately 30-fold higher JA concentrations than aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes. Furthermore, to quantitatively estimate SA/JA response states, we developed transcriptomic biomarkers using a machine learning approach. The marker specifically estimated response states to target phytohormones. Through analysis of npr3/4 double mutants, we confirmed that the biomarkers were applicable to the analysis of mutants. The biomarkers will allow us to extract insights into phytohormone responses from various large-scale transcriptome data, e.g., field transcriptomics and single-cell RNA-Seq.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

To maintain a healthy population of mitochondria, dysfunctional and excess mitochondria are selectively removed through an autophagic process known as mitophagy. Over the past few decades, various autophagy-related (ATG) proteins involved in mitophagy have been well characterized in yeast and mammalian cells since it has significance to the survival of eukaryotes. While the core autophagy machinery responsible for autophagosome formation is conserved among eukaryotes, the homologs of key regulators of mammalian system is absent in plant. In this study, we identified a unique mitophagy mechanism in plant, that three voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) family proteins in the mitochondria outer membrane - specifically VDAC1, VDAC2, and VDAC3 - as mitophagy receptors in Arabidopsis. These proteins were required for translocation of ATG8 from the cytosol to the mitochondria surface, when Arabidopsis cells were treated with an uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP). The VDACs interacted directly with ATG8 through an ATG8-interacting motif (AIM) located in their amino (N) termini. Furthermore, vdac mutants exhibited impaired uncoupler-induced mitophagy and accumulated damaged mitochondria. These mitophagy-related phenotypes were more pronounced in vdac double and triple mutant lines. Altogether, our results indicated that VDAC1, 2, and 3 recruit ATG8 to depolarized mitochondria, facilitating the formation of mitophagosomes, presenting a distinguishing mitophagy pathway with mammalian system.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

Long-term autophagy inhibition results in altered pyruvate metabolism likely regulated by lower pyrimidine pools. Cells adapting to loss of autophagy preferentially salvage pyrimidines to replenish these pools instead of synthesizing them de novo. Exploiting this metabolic vulnerability, we found that acquired resistance to autophagy inhibition promotes increased salvage and therefore sensitivity to pyrimidine analogues, including gemcitabine and trifluridine/tipiracil leading to combinatory effects with autophagy inhibitors and pyrimidine analogs.

Soybean transcriptomics previously identified a GATA transcription factor, involved in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, as responsive to elevated [CO2]. Supported by in silico modeling, we therefore hypothesized that this gene plays a previously unrecognized role in responding to elevated [CO2]. Wildtype and a T-DNA insertion line of Arabidopsis thaliana for GNC (GATA, Nitrate Inducible, Carbon Metabolism Involved) were grown under three treatments: sustained ambient [CO2], sustained elevated [CO2], and transfer from ambient to elevated [CO2], to assess changes in their physiology, biochemistry, and transcriptome. Photosynthetic and biomass responses to elevated [CO2] and transfer [CO2] in plants lacking GNC were significantly weaker than WT. A lag of 25-73 hrs in transcriptomic responses after transfer to elevated [CO2] was consistent with indirect sensing, presumably via sugar signals. The breakdown of the gene expression network around GNC was most pronounced in the transfer treatment and suggests targets for further study of interactions between elevated [CO2] and sulfur and nitrogen metabolism. This work provides a case study of a CO2-responsive transcription factor that may be a compelling target for adapting crops to future growing conditions after further characterization.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Peripheral anatomy and central connectivity of proprioceptive sensory neurons in the Drosophila wing", "doi": "10.1101/2025.05.29.656810", "authors": "Lesser, E.; Moussa, A.; Tuthill, J. C.", "abstract": "Recent advances in electron microscopy (EM) and automated image segmentation have produced synaptic wiring diagrams of the Drosophila central nervous system. A limitation of existing fly connectome datasets is that most sensory neurons are excised during sample preparation, creating a gap between the central and peripheral nervous systems. Here, we bridge this gap by reconstructing wing sensory axons from the Female Adult Nerve Cord (FANC) EM dataset and mapping them to peripheral sensory structures using genetic tools and light microscopy. We confirm the location and identity of known wing mechanosensory neurons and identify previously uncharacterized axons, including a novel population of putative proprioceptors that make monosynaptic connections onto wing steering motor neurons. We also find that proprioceptors of adjacent campaniform sensilla on the wing have distinct axon morphologies and postsynaptic partners, suggesting a high degree of specialization in axon pathfinding and synaptic partner matching. The peripheral location and central projections of wing sensory neurons are stereotyped across flies, allowing this wing proprioceptor atlas and genetic toolkit to guide analysis of other fly connectome datasets.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

While transcriptional adaptations in NAc medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes, those enriched in dopamine receptor 1(D1) or dopamine receptor 2 (D2) and adenosine 2a receptor (A2A) are well characterized in socially stressed male rodents, there is less knowledge of MSN subtype adaptations in socially stressed females. Methods: Chronic witness defeat stress (CWDS) was performed in female D1-Cre-RiboTag and A2A-Cre-RiboTag mice. After stress, mice were separated into high- and low-social interactors with a three Chamber Social Interaction test. Following isolation of ribosome-associated mRNA, MSN subtype-specific gene expression profiles were determined with RNA sequencing followed by differential gene expression analysis (DEG) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Consensus WGCNA with male mouse social defeat stress and clinically relevant human transcriptomic datasets was performed to examine the translational sex-specific molecular signatures. Results: 9 DEGs in D1-MSNs and 630 in A2A-MSNs were identified in female stress groups (FDR < 0.05). D1-MSN DEGs were mostly upregulated in CWDS low vs high interactors and were enriched for functions related to energy homeostasis and cell adhesion. A2A-MSN DEGs upregulated in low interactors involved structural molecules while downregulated genes involved neurotransmission. WGCNA identified 9 significant D1- and 5 significant A2A-MSN modules related to cell structure, protein synthesis, synapse and mitochondria. The most impacted modules from each subtype (based on DEG count) were enriched for PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway and regulated by the Nf1 transcription factor. Consensus module analysis identified a module significantly associated with social stress in a sex- and subtype-specific manner in both mice and humans enriched for genes involved in the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. Conclusion: Chronic social stress-induced sex-specific molecular signatures were uncovered in female subjects. Consensus modules across stress and clinical populations implicate alterations in MSN subtypes could contribute to MDD signatures among female populations.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

S.; Sajikumar, S.", "abstract": "Hippocampal area CA2 plays an important role in social memory formation. However, CA2 is characterised by plasticity-resistant Schaffer collateral-CA2 (SC-CA2) synapses and highly plastic entorhinal cortex-CA2 (EC-CA2) synapses. Despite abundant dopaminergic input, the relationship between dopamine signalling and area CA2 synaptic plasticity remains unexplored. Here, we show that SKF-38393-mediated Dopamine D1-like receptor (dopamine D1 and D5 receptors) activation differentially primes CA2 inputs in an NMDAR and protein synthesis-dependent manner. We defined an inverted-U shape relationship between SKF-38393 concentration and EC-CA2 potentiation. Additionally, we observed a priming effect on SC-CA2 plasticity with 50M SKF-38393, relieving plasticity resistance. We also demonstrated that this effect follows canonical protein kinase A (PKA) signalling. Collectively, our results show that D1R activation primes the CA2 for synaptic plasticity. Thus, we propose a link between neuropsychiatric diseases related to impaired dopamine transmission and deficits in hippocampus-dependent social memory.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

C.", "abstract": "Adaptation is a fundamental aspect of motor learning. Intelligent systems must adapt to perturbations in the environment while simultaneously maintaining stable memories. Classic work has argued that this trade-off could be resolved by complementary learning systems operating at different speeds; yet the mechanisms enabling coordination between slow and fast systems remain unknown. Here, we propose a multi-region distributed learning model in which learning is shared between two populations of neurons with distinct roles and structures: a recurrent 'controller' network which stores a slowly evolving memory, and a feedforward 'adapter' network that rapidly learns to respond to perturbations in the environment. In our model, supervised learning in the adapter produces a predictive error signal that simultaneously tutors consolidation in the controller through a local plasticity rule. Our model offers insight into the mechanisms that may support distributed computations in the motor cortex and cerebellum during motor adaptation.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Semantic Memory Traces Reflect How They Were Last Retrieved", "doi": "10.1101/2025.05.30.657135", "authors": "Qi, X.; Coutanche, M. N.", "abstract": "Episodic memories are known to change with each act of retrieval. We hypothesize that semantic memories are altered in a similar way when retrieval draws on a core dimension of conceptual knowledge: semantic granularity. Each level, from accessing a concept via unique perceptual features to its thematic context, shapes the retrieval route used to access semantic memories. This study tests whether semantic granularities used to retrieve a concept influences its reactivation during later recognition. Human participants learned and retrieved novel word-image pairs while undergoing fMRI. Following encoding, items were retrieved via one of three semantic levels: item, category, or theme. Later, participants accessed the memories in recognition and cued recall tests. Although behavioral memory performance was matched across conditions, neural activity during recognition varied based on prior retrieval history. Recognition patterns could be classified according to prior retrieval granularity in ventral temporal cortex for both remembered and non-remembered concepts, and in the hippocampus for remembered concepts only. A whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed bilateral clusters along the ventral visual stream, from early visual cortex to fusiform gyrus, where retrieval history was decodable. Representational similarity analyses showed that category-level retrieval increased pattern consistency in early visual cortex and pattern reactivation in ventral temporal cortex, while item-level retrieval enhanced memory trace distinctiveness in visual word form area. Theme-level retrieval increased activity in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings show that how we access a concept leaves a detectable trace on subsequent neural reactivation, subtly shaping how conceptual knowledge is organized in the brain.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Redundancy masking and the compression of information in the brain", "doi": "10.1101/2025.05.30.657088", "authors": "O\u0308ztas, D. N.; L-Miao, L.; Sayim, B.; Alp, N.", "abstract": "The visual world is inherently complex, presenting far more information than a human visual system can process in full. To manage this overload, the visual brain employs several mechanisms. One mechanism that possibly contributes to the reduction of information is redundancy masking (RM): the reduction of the number of perceived items in repeating patterns. For example, when three identical lines are presented in the periphery, observers often perceive only two. The underlying neural mechanisms of RM remain unclear. Here, we use steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) to examine whether redundancy-masked items are neurally suppressed or integrated with neighboring items. Three identical arcs (quarter-circles; 0.44{degrees} line width) were presented in the periphery (eccentricities: 17.3{degrees}, 19.5{degrees}, and 21.7{degrees}), each tagged with a unique frequency. Participants maintained central fixation, monitored via a gaze-contingent control, and reported the number of arcs they predominantly perceived after each 10s trial. We analyzed baseline-corrected amplitudes at each tagged frequency and calculated signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for fundamental and intermodulation (IM) components, separating trials by behavioral responses (RM: 2 items perceived, non-RM: 3 items perceived). Fundamental frequency comparisons revealed that the outer arc elicited higher SSVEP responses than the inner and middle one under RM, with no significant differences between arcs under non-RM. However, fundamental frequency SNRs did not differ between RM and non-RM perceptions. When we compared IM SNRs, the middle and outer arc's combination was significantly higher during RM compared to non-RM, suggesting increased neural integration between them. These results indicate that RM involves a loss of conscious access to visual information, yet corresponding neural signals are not entirely suppressed. Instead, the neural signatures we found suggest the integration with neighboring elements across space and time. We suggest that redundancy-masked items - although unavailable for conscious report- are still observed in the neural signatures of RM.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "Objective: Skeletal muscle myogenesis, during development and regeneration, are primarily facilitated by the progeny of resident muscle stem cells, the muscle progenitor cells (MPCs). Intriguingly, extracellular glutamine (Gln) is required by MPCs. Disruptions in Gln availability or metabolism, impair MPC function and hinder skeletal muscle regeneration. Gln, a nutritionally non-essential amino acid (NEAA), which is most abundant in skeletal muscle, becomes conditionally essential during advancing age and catabolic states like sepsis, trauma, and strenuous situations. The intracellular mechanisms through which extracellular Gln availability affects MPC proliferation are poorly understood. Therefore, this study was aimed to examine how extracellular supply of Gln influences myogenesis through the spatial distribution of TCA-cycle enzymes. Methods: Human primary muscle myoblasts (HSKM2) and murine MPCs (C2C12) were utilized for in-vitro experiments. To investigate the impact of Gln availability on MPC proliferation, proliferation assays, confocal imaging, succinyl-proteomics, and single-cell nuclei ATAC sequencing were used. Results: Gln (2 mM) significantly enhanced MPC viability and cell cycle progression, while Gln depletion (0 mM) reduced cell number and induced G0/G1 arrest. Gln deficiency downregulated MyoD expression, impairing myogenic potential. Inhibiting intracellular Gln metabolism also limited proliferation, indicating the necessity of Gln catabolism for cell proliferation. Gln deficiency increased nuclear localization of TCA cycle enzymes (DLST, OGDH), elevated histone succinylation, and restricted chromatin accessibility of the myogenic regulatory factor, MyoD1, highlighting a Gln dependent metabolic-epigenetic nexus in myogenic regulation. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that extracellular Gln availability is a key regulator of myogenesis through its influence on metabolism, epigenetic modifications, and chromatin accessibility.

Here, we combine massively parallel enhancer assays with chromatin structure and transcriptome profiling to functionally annotate enhancers genome-wide in human induced pluripotent stem cells. We find that a substantial fraction (~40%) of accessible chromatin regions with enhancer function lack key features associated with active enhancers, including the active enhancer mark histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation and enhancer-associated RNAs. Perturbation of this class of non-canonical enhancers by CRISPR-mediated epigenome editing results in decreased levels of target gene expression and, in one instance, loss of pluripotent stem cell characteristics.

By modeling stress-induced changes in animals, we may improve diagnosis or treatment of these disorders. Successful translation benefits from studies with sufficient statistical power and outcome measurements that can be directly compared across species. We performed a meta-analysis to examine the impact of chronic stress on the whole blood transcriptome. Methods: Datasets were systematically identified in Gemma, a database of reprocessed public transcriptional profiling studies; datasets GSE68076, GSE72262, and GSE84185 met inclusion/exclusion parameters. Each study exposed eight-week old mice to chronic stress (5-10 days social defeat stress or 6-8 weeks chronic mild stress). The final sample size was n=92 (n=45 Non-Stress/n=47 Stress). Stress-related differential expression in each dataset was quantified using the Limma pipeline followed by empirical Bayes moderation. For the 9,219 genes represented in all three datasets, we ran a meta-analysis of Log(2) Fold Changes using a random effects model and corrected for false discovery rate (FDR). Functional patterns were assessed with fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Cell type specific enrichment for each of the differentially expressed genes was further explored using a public 10x genomics scRNA-Seq dataset from mouse peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Results: Findings included 23 downregulated and 16 upregulated transcripts in stress-exposed mice (FDR<0.05). Results indicated a down-regulation in gene sets related to B cells, immune response, DNA and chromatin regulation, ribosomal activity, translation, and catabolic cellular processes.

These protein accumulations are thought to be caused by impaired waste removal. In an alternative hypothesis, we have proposed the existence of an extensive glial canal system that is likely formed by myelinated aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-expressing tanycytes and removes cellular waste from the hippocampal formation. Here, we demonstrate that tanycyte-derived waste-internalizing receptacles are immunoreactive for A{beta} and emanate from specialized nucleus-like organelles in the following referred to as 'tanysomes.' Utilizing RNA-scope in situ hybridization, we demonstrate that these receptacle-forming tanysomes express RNA for AQP4 and the A{beta}-related genes, amyloid precursor protein, and presenilin 1. These findings suggest that A{beta} is likely synthesized where receptacle formation is observed and that A{beta} may play an important structural role in receptacle formation. In AD-affected hippocampus excessive amounts of A{beta}-immunoreactive waste receptacles emerge from tanysomes and have the appearance of plaques in A{beta}-immunolabeled hippocampus. Moreover, we demonstrate that the same receptacle-forming organelles exhibit strong immunolabeling for hyperphosphorylated tau protein in AD-affected tissue. We postulate that both proteins may play important structural roles in waste uptake and that hypertrophic swelling of impaired tanycytes in AD-affected brain may be due to obstructions of this extensive interconnected glial canal system.", "date": "2025-06-01", "journal": ""}
