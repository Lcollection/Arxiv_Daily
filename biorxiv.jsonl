I analyze a spatially explicit model that incorporates all three processes, tracking propagules subject to habitat filtering and conspecific density dependence. The model shows that dispersal limitation and habitat filtering interact with JC-effects in qualitatively different ways. Aggregation driven by dispersal limitation weakens the ability of JC-effects to maintain coexistence, whereas when JC-effects and HP operate together in spatially autocorrelated habitats, richness increases with conspecific aggregation. JC-HP interactions strongly depend on habitat spatial structure. If habitats are not spatially autocorrelated, JC-effects and HP minimally interact (or act antagonistically when coupled with dispersal limitation) and do not maintain high species richness. However, when habitats are positively autocorrelated the two mechanisms act synergistically. To explain these patterns, I introduce a novel metric -- the spatial JC-HP covariance -- which quantifies how strongly JC-effects are concentrated in favorable versus unfavorable environments, providing a direct measure of the extent to which JC-effects and HP synergistically promote coexistence.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Ablation of Tbx5+/Mef2cAHF+ progenitors cause IVS disorganization, right ventricular hypoplasia and mixing of IVS lineages. Reduced dosage of the CHD transcription factor TBX5 disrupts boundary position and integrity, resulting in ventricular septation defects (VSDs) and patterning defects, including misexpression of Slit2 and Ntn1, which encode guidance cues. Reducing NTN1 dosage partly rescues cardiac defects in Tbx5 mutant embryos. Loss of Slit2 or Ntn1 causes VSDs and perturbed septal lineage distributions. Thus, we identify Tbx5 as a candidate selector gene, directing progenitors and regulating essential cues, to pattern a compartment boundary for proper cardiac septation, revealing mechanisms for cardiac birth defects", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

To make progress, we recorded auditory cortex activity from behaving mice during passive tone presentation and simultaneously monitored pupil-indexed arousal. In these experiments, neural discriminability of tones was maximized at intermediate arousal, revealing a neural correlate of the inverted-U. We explained this arousal-dependent sound processing using a spiking model with clusters. In the model, stimulus discriminability peaked as the network transitioned from a multi-attractor phase exhibiting slow switching between metastable cluster activations (low arousal) to a single-attractor phase with uniform activity (high arousal). This transition also qualitatively captured arousal-induced reductions of neural variability observed in the data. Altogether, this study elucidates computational principles to explain interactions between arousal, neural discriminability, and variability, and suggests that transitions in the dynamical regime of cortical networks could underlie nonlinear modulations of sensory processing.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

It is uncontroversial because reproductive isolation may readily emerge as a by-product of evolutionary divergence during allopatry unopposed by gene flow. Recent genomic studies have found that gene flow between species is common, but whether allopatric speciation is common has rarely been systematically tested across a continuum of closely-related species. Here, we fit a range of demographic models of evolutionary divergence to whole-genome sequence data from 93 pairs of Drosophila species to infer speciation histories and levels of post-divergence gene flow. We find that speciation with gene flow is common, even between currently allopatric pairs of species. Estimates of historical gene flow are not predicted by current range overlap. Whilst evidence for secondary contact is generally limited, a few sympatric pairs showed strong support for a secondary contact model. Our analyses suggest that most speciation processes involve some long-term gene flow, perhaps due to repeated cycles of allopatry and contact, without requiring an extensive allopatric phase.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Ciliates have major advantages for such studies due to their easily visible surface patterning, that is highly consistent among cells of the same species, and their dramatic and complex behaviors that can be easily analyzed. Among the ciliates, the genus Stentor epitomizes the features that are useful for studying evolution: they are widespread in freshwater environments, easy to visualize because of their large size, and capable of complex behaviors such as learning, decision-making, and phototaxis. Here, we introduce the discovery of a new species within this genus: Stentor stipatus, so named for their distinctive cytosolic dark brown aggregates which surround the macronucleus and are present alongside cortically distributed green microalgae. We present morphological, phylogenetic, ecological, and behavioral characterizations of these cells. The S. stipatus clade has a bootstrap value of 93 and is phylogenetically distinct from S. amethystinus, the closest related species.

Occluding junction components further regulate signaling pathways in a cell-type specific manner.

Under unstructured inputs, our recurrent networks developed strong unidirectional connections, resulting in spontaneous repeating sequences of spikes. During ongoing plasticity these sequences repeated despite turnover of individual synaptic connections, a process reminiscent of synaptic drift. The turnover process occurred over different timescales, with sequence-promoting connectivity types and motif structures being strengthened while others weakened, leading to sequences with different degrees of volatility. Structured inputs could reinforce or retrain the resulting connectivity structures underlying sequences, enabling stable yet flexible encoding of inputs.

However, SBDD for RNA faces a technical challenge, a paucity of available tertiary structures of RNA-ligand complexes. We addressed this problem by theoretically generating RNA conformations with cryptic binding sites from apo RNA conformations. Recalling that molecular dynamic simulation studies have not resulted in RNA conformations with the cryptic binding site, even for the paradigmatic RNA-ligand complex, HIV-1 Transactivation Response Element (TAR) binding to MV-2003, we leveraged sampling performance of apo RNA conformations by using a generative deep learning model (DL), Molearn.

Here, we analyzed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets of mouse and human CREB and the synaptonuclear factor CREB-regulated transcription coactivator1 (CRTC1) to identify relevant target genes and biological pathways coupling neuronal activity to synaptic function/plasticity. Our analyses indicate that CRTC1 specifically couples neuronal activity with synaptic plasticity by binding to conserved promoters of CREB target genes comprising inducible transcription factors (including c-fos, Crem, Npas4 and Nr4a1-3), and neuronal excitability and plasticity genes, including Ntrk2, Homer1, Dlg4 (PSD-95) and the NMDA receptor subunit Grin1 (GluN1). CRTC1/CREB target genes were highly enriched in gene ontology (GO) nuclear terms, including several members of the CREB family, and transcriptional modulators and repressors. Interestingly, GO enrichment and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses revealed that genes mediating synapse-to-nucleus signaling (including most known synaptonuclear factors and direct interacting modulators) are collectively regulated by CREB/CRTC1, and that protein kinase C (PKC) is a key interactor of the CRTC1/14-3-3 complex at synapses. In agreement with these in silico analyses, we show that CRTC1 regulates synaptic activity-dependent phosphorylation and synaptic recruitment of GluN1 mediated by PKC in hippocampal neurons, and that PKC activation reverses NMDA receptor-mediated currents and long-term potentiation (LTP) deficits caused by CRTC1 silencing in the hippocampus. Consistent with genomics and functional data, morphological and behavioral analyses show crucial roles of CRTC1 on dendritic spine structure, plasticity, and hippocampal-dependent associative memory.

We find evidence that grouping can indeed improve the performance (as judged by AICc) of species-interaction models, but we also observe that there is no single optimal grouping. Further, those groupings that did prove beneficial could not have been easily predicted from available species attributes, calling into question the prevailing method of a priori species grouping.

To address this, we investigated goddard (gdrd), an orphan gene essential for spermatogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. Within the Drosophila genus, Gdrd proteins retain a conserved core structure but display substantial variation in length and primary sequence. Here we perform cross-species gene-swap assays in D. melanogaster testes to examine how these lineage-specific changes affect Gdrd function. Strikingly, the highly divergent D. mojavensis ortholog fully rescues fertility in gdrd null flies, suggesting that ancestral Gdrd acted within a conserved spermatogenesis pathway. By contrast, several orthologs, including one from a more closely related species, cannot substitute for the melanogaster gene. Cytological analysis shows that all divergent Gdrd orthologs retain some ability to interact with axonemes and ring centrioles, consistent with the protein's structural conservation, but many non-complementing orthologs display weaker axonemal binding. Furthermore, all tested orthologs exhibit divergent localizations to organellar structures. Using computational analyses and molecular dynamics simulations, we identified intrinsic protein qualities that may account for several observations made in the gene swap assays. Rescuing orthologs bear motifs with shared physicochemical properties in their intrinsically disordered regions, while non-rescuing variants exhibit structural instabilities.

While scalable, automated methods are subject to assumptions that often fail to account for biophysical changes in action potential waveforms, leading to systematic errors. Consequently, manual curation of these errors, which is both time-consuming and lacks reproducibility, remains necessary. To improve efficiency and reproducibility in the spike-sorting pipeline, we introduce here the Spike-sorting Lapse Amelioration System (SLAy), an algorithm that automatically merges oversplit spike clusters. SLAy employs two novel metrics: (1) a waveform similarity metric that uses a neural network to obtain spatially informed, time-shift invariant low-dimensional waveform representations, and (2) a cross-correlogram significance metric based on the earth-movers distance between the observed and null cross-correlograms. We demonstrate that SLAy achieves ~ 85% agreement with human curators across a diverse set of animal models, brain regions, and probe geometries.

T.", "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) models may perform inconsistently on individual classes on nominal outputs or ranges on continuous outputs, collectively referred to here as bins. Models should be assessed through metrics that consider each bin individually, called bin metrics. Inconsistent model performance is often due to model fitting with imbalanced data. Towards improving modelling of imbalanced data, novel model fitting methods are proposed including using bin metrics as loss functions and the use of Epoch sampling. Imbalanced data also poses a challenge for appropriate data splitting. Akin split is a novel method proposed that objectively yields the most appropriate data split(s). Existing and novel model fitting methods were used to fit models, and the models were assessed by a bin metric in two case studies. The first case study used synthetically generated datasets with different levels of noise and imbalance. On datasets with noise and greater levels of imbalance, Epoch sampling significantly improved the model performance by up to 23.6% while significantly using less resources (computation and time) by up to 57.7% compared to a standard model fitting method. The second case study used protein-genome interactions data that are often severely right-skewed. Akin split was used to split the data more appropriately than traditional methods. Model fitting methods were tried on two model configurations. The effects of the model fitting methods varied by the model configuration, but all models were significantly improved by up to 57.7% compared to the standard model fitting.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Even though SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have reduced the speed of the infection significantly, they could not fully stop it. On the contrary, the World Health Organization has recently published cautionary statements that infection counts are on the rise, and a huge wave is expected in winter. Vaccines mostly target specific regions of the virus. The high mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is one essential tool that the virus exploits to escape from the available vaccines. Therefore, researchers have been working on designing next-generation vaccines against the new variants of the virus. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 acquires new mutations faster than we can adapt our vaccines due to long clinical trial periods. Hence, there is a need for computational tools that can predict future SARS-CoV-2 mutations before they even emerge. In this paper, we propose several deep-learning-based methods to estimate the possible future mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome. We design and evaluate various ensemble and bagging architectures enriched with a large set of genomic, biochemical, and phylogenetic features.

Using the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model, we prove that the consumer's maximum output power lies exactly on the Hopf boundary that separates stable points from cycles; at that point, the resulting power efficiency is intermediate. In the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model the Hopf is supercritical, so a stable limit cycle appears smoothly as the equilibrium loses stability. We treat the Hopf onset of time-periodic population oscillations as a population-level analogue of sustained cycling under energy flux. We then embed these energetic statements in adaptive dynamics: with convex trait costs, evolutionary singular strategies exist and are locally stable, but they coincide with the maximum-power state only under explicit marginal-cost conditions. Together, these results unify classic ideas in the concrete setting of consumer-resource systems and suggest measurements to evaluate when bifurcations, energetics, and evolution can converge.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we conduct a pilot study examining the extent of archaeological metadata reporting in 30 peer-reviewed human paleogenomic studies, based on genetic sequences from 3911 ancient humans predominately from Western Eurasia, published between 2013 and 2024. We show inconsistent reporting of archaeological data across studies, and have sought to identify the driving factors. Overall, we found no strong explanatory variables, though some metadata fields - like Geolocation - have improved in completeness over time. These inconsistencies mean that metadata reporting is often insufficient to directly investigate the relationship between patterns of cultural and genetic change on the basis of published data alone.

We examine how the amount and within-plant damage spatial uniformity (i.e., dispersed and concentrated damage) affect EFN production and ant-mediated defence in wild cotton (Gossypium hirsutum). Previous work suggests that severe and concentrated damage is costliest to plants, leading us to hypothesise that such damage would induce greater EFN production and, consequently, stronger ant attraction and protection. We conducted a greenhouse experiment in which plants were subjected to one of the following mechanical damage treatments: control (no damage), low damage (two damaged leaves, 30% of area removed each), high concentrated damage (two damaged leaves, 60% each), and high dispersed damage (four damaged leaves, 30% each; i.e., same total area than concentrated damage). The day after treatments, we measured EFN volume and sugar content from one nectary per plant (a per-nectary EFN response), and the number of secreting nectaries per plant (a proxy for whole-plant level EFN response). Subsequently, we performed a field experiment using the same treatments to evaluate EFN-mediated ant recruitment and ant-provided protection by placing caterpillars on plants. Both high-damage treatments increased EFN volume per nectary, whereas low damage did not. However, against our prediction, dispersed damage was the only treatment that increased the number of secreting nectaries. Consistently, once placed in the field, plants with dispersed damage recruited more ants and caterpillars on them were more likely to be attacked by ants. Contrary to expectations, plants subjected to dispersed damage exhibited a greater total investment in EFN, presumably via local induction of more nectaries per plant, and thereby enhancing ant-mediated defence. This study highlights the importance of herbivory intensity and within-plant spatial uniformity in shaping ant-plant interactions.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate how different biophysical parameter sets can lead to equivalent bifurcation sequences. Using a minimal neuron model with three variable conductances, we systematically explore how changes in extracellular potassium, mimicking physiological and pathological conditions, affect neuronal dynamics. Our results reveal that neurons with distinct intrinsic properties can traverse the same bifurcation pathways, entering regimes of bursting, seizure-like activity, and depolarization block.

However, it remains unclear whether eye movements also reflect the meaning or behavioral relevance of remembered stimuli. Here, we show that human gaze behavior encodes abstract categorical information independent of physical stimulus features. In three experiments, participants learned to classify oriented stimuli according to an arbitrary rule while their eye movements were recorded. Category identity could be reliably decoded records of gaze position, particularly on trials with accurate categorization. Control experiments confirmed that these effects were not driven by low-level visual or motor factors.

Here, we report the characterization of a novel cross-talk mechanism by which CDK1 and Aurora B (AURKB) kinases regulate the distribution and interactions of Citron kinase (CIT-K). We show that CDK1 and AURKB phosphorylate two serine residues, S440 and S699, located adjacent to or within CIT-K coiled coil domain. S440 and S699 temporal phosphorylation profiles reflect the activity of the kinases responsible for their phosphorylation. Functional analyses using phospho mutants indicate that S699 phosphorylation is important for CIT-K localization and successful cytokinesis, while perturbing S440 phosphorylation leads to abnormal midbody formation and accumulation of post-mitotic midbody remnants (MBRs). Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation at either residue reduces the ability of CIT-K to interact with its midbody partners AURKB, KIF14 and KIF23/MKLP1. Together, our findings indicate that phosphorylation of CIT-K by CDK1 and AURKB regulates midbody formation and MBR stability by controlling the association of CIT-K with its partners.

Here, we present BOGO (Bxb1-landing pad human ORFeome-integrated system for a proteome-wide Gene Overexpression), a robust, scalable, and reproducible screening platform that enables single-copy, site-specific integration and overexpression of ~19,000 human ORFs across cancer cell models. Using BOGO, we identified drug-specific response drivers for 16 chemotherapeutic agents and integrated clinical datasets to uncover proliferation and resistance-associated genes with prognostic potential. Drug response similarity networks revealed both shared and unique mechanisms, highlighting key pathways such as autophagy, apoptosis, and Wnt signaling, and notable resistance-associated genes including BCL2, POLD2, and TRADD.

Recent studies also showed that UPR signaling has important roles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell biology. However, whether UPR signaling regulates hematopoietic lineage fate decision remains elusive. Here, we found that Fc{gamma}R- MPP3 generates erythroid lineage and Jak2V617F mutation leads to overproduction of erythroid cells by expanding Fc{gamma}R- MPP3. We showed that UPR signaling increases myeloid cell production through promoting Fc{gamma}R- MPP3 transition to granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) producing Fc{gamma}R+ MPP3 at the expense of erythroid lineage via the XBP1 pathway. Under a disease condition, UPR signaling cooperates with Jak2V617F mutation and exacerbates disease phenotype as increasing red blood cells in a mouse model of polycythemia vera (PV) through the ATF4 pathway. Activation of UPR signaling also increased myeloid output in healthy donor bone marrow MPP cells while skewing the output towards erythroid lineage in PV patient bone marrow MPP cells.

We find that these residues are highly conserved in present-day Old-World alphaviruses but are divergent in New-World lineages. This suggests that the common ancestor of both groups likely assembled cores using the same molecular interactions seen in present-day Old-World viruses. We propose that early divergence in these interactions weakened core assembly efficiency, potentially contributing to the attenuation observed in encephalitic New-World alphaviruses. This attenuation may reflect an adaptive trade-off, in which reduced assembly efficiency lowers viral replication and virulence, supporting long-term persistence in enzootic cycles.

To address this, we generated multiomic datasets, including RNA-seq and proteomics, from human iPSC-derived neurons depleted of TDP-43.

However, accurate strain-level analysis remains challenging due to limited linkage information, ambiguous read mapping, and complicating factors such as genome similarity, sequencing depth, and community complexity. These challenges are especially pronounced for short-read metagenomic data when estimating the relative abundances of multiple strains, a task critical for genotype-phenotype association studies. Results: To address this gap, we present Strainify, which enables accurate strain-level abundance estimation from short-read metagenomes with as little as 1% genome coverage. Specifically, Strainify combines (1) identification of informative variants via core genome alignment, (2) filtering of confounding variants via a window-based test, and (3) maximum likelihood estimation of strain abundances. A Shannon entropy-weighted version of the model further improves robustness in noisy, low-coverage settings by downweighting sites with low information content. Across simulated communities of varying complexity, Strainify consistently outperformed existing approaches. On mock community sequencing data, the estimates produced by Strainify aligned more closely with reference abundances. When applied to a longitudinal gut microbiome dataset, Strainify successfully recapitulated the reported temporal dynamics of Bacteroides ovatus strain groups, demonstrating its ability to recover biologically meaningful patterns from real-world metagenomes.

DPCs, isolated and expanded under differentiation-suppressive conditions, showed strong tumor-homing ability when injected intraperitoneally into a mouse model of gastric cancer dissemination. Fluorescent imaging and histological analysis confirmed selective accumulation of DPCs within tumor lesions through CXCR4/SDF1 mediated chemotaxis. Introduction of the NIS gene markedly increased SLC5A5 expression and enabled efficient uptake of At-211. High resolution alpha particle imaging visualized alpha ray emission specifically from NIS-DPCs, confirming intracellular retention of the radionuclide. In vivo, sequential administration of NIS-DPCs followed by Na[At-211] led to pronounced regression of peritoneal tumors and significant survival extension compared with controls. The therapeutic mechanism involves three coordinated steps: tumor-directed migration of NIS-DPCs, At-211 uptake via NIS transporters, and localized alpha particle mediated cytotoxicity.

It involves Pol{delta}-mediated DNA strand displacement synthesis that produces 5' flaps, FEN1-mediated 5' flap cleavage, and LIG1-catalyzed nick ligation. Recently, we discovered that under stress conditions, yeast cells convert 5' flaps into 3' flaps, which are degraded by 3' flap nucleases to produce ligatable DNA nicks. However, little is known about this stress-induced, 3' flap-based OFM in human cells. Here, we report that 3' flaps frequently form in various human cancer cells, and that FEN1 deficiency significantly enhances 3' flap levels. XPF1 is recruited to the replication forks in FEN1 mutant or FEN1-chemically inhibited cells. Notably, XPF deficiency or inhibition in those defective cells leads to accumulation of 3' flaps, replication-related DNA strand breaks, and unique mutation signatures. Furthermore, XPF and FEN1 inhibitors show synergistic effects in killing human cancer cells. In summary, we demonstrate that 3' flap-based OFM is an important alternative of 5' flap-based OFM in mammalian cells. XPF is a key nuclease to degrade 3' flaps and complete OFM for survival. Targeting this compensatory mechanism could provide new therapeutic strategies to selectively impair cancer cell survival under pre-existed replication stress.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that near-identical Pm3 alleles vary greatly in resistance efficacy and broadness against a global mildew isolate collection and subsequently use this model system to study the mechanisms underlying broad-spectrum resistance. We demonstrate that two alleles, Pm3d and Pm3e, provide resistance against the majority of isolates worldwide, by each recognizing two AVR effectors from powdery mildew, thereby lowering the risk of resistance breakdown. While Pm3d recognizes two closely related RNase-like AVR effectors, Pm3e detects two structurally diverse AVRs, including an effector belonging to a large, uncharacterized protein family with a novel structural fold. Using chimeric Pm3 NLRs, we identify specificity-defining polymorphisms of Pm3d and Pm3e against their diverse effector targets. Lastly, we demonstrate that Pm3d and Pm3e activities can be combined in engineered Pm3 NLRs, thereby further extending their recognition spectrum.

By optimizing secretion signals and display scaffolds, PIONEER ensures stable ligand retention and robust autocrine signaling. The ability to assess peptide and protein ligand activity through signaling, rather than binding alone, marks a key advance toward function-first screening. Applied to human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the system enables detection of surface expression, ligand activity profiling, and classification of nanobody regulators, including antagonists and conformational stabilizers. It also distinguishes intrabodies based on their functional effects and chaperone activity.

Ketogenic diets have mixed effects on tumorigenesis and compliance is challenging. Exogenous ketones, beta-hydroxybutyrate or acetoacetate (AcAc), offer an alternative approach. While beta-hydroxybutyrate has been investigated, the anti-cancer effects of AcAc are poorly defined. Here, we show that orally administering ethyl AcAc (EAA) suppresses tumor growth in several pre-clinical CRC models. Single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, and genetic and antibody-mediated depletion studies reveal that EAA selectively expands and activates cytotoxic mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in an MHC class I-related protein 1 (MR1)-dependent manner. EAA increases MR1 expression by tumor monocytes, which is recapitulated in human cell cultures, where AcAc and 5-amino-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-A-RU) induce MAIT cell expansion and tumor killing. Mechanistically, AcAc converts to methylglyoxal, combining with microbially-derived 5-A-RU to generate 5-(2-oxopropylideneamino)-6-D-ribitylaminouracil (5-OP-RU), a potent MR1 ligand.

However, the processes by which these internally guided decisions are formed and translated into action remain unclear. We tested whether neural signatures of evidence accumulation and motor preparation - established in perceptual decision-making - are also observed during voluntary decisions. Forty-nine adults made voluntary (free choice between two options) and forced (single specified choice) decisions while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. To isolate decision formation from action selection, all responses were made with a right-handed keypress. After applying signal deconvolution and current source density transformations, we examined three signals: the centro-parietal positivity (CPP), Mu/Beta (8 - 30 Hz) amplitudes, and a left-hemisphere readiness potential contralateral to the response hand. For both voluntary and forced decisions, CPP and Mu/Beta amplitudes showed hallmark accumulation-to-bound dynamics - faster responses had steeper ramping signals that converged to stereotyped pre-response amplitude levels. The left-hemisphere readiness potential likewise showed convergence to a pre-response level but with less reliable evidence for RT-dependent slope scaling, resembling a late, effector-specific motor gate rather than an evolving decision variable. Waveform amplitudes across the time course of these signals also did not differ reliably between voluntary and forced decisions. Our results indicate that, like perceptual decisions, voluntary choices are also formed by a graded accumulation process that culminates in a motor action, with the CPP indexing an evolving decision variable and Mu/Beta indexing effector-specific motor readiness.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

In Drosophila, six OA receptors have been identified: Oamb, Oct2R, Oct1R, Oct2R, Oct3R, and Oct-TyrR, and they have been linked to different behavioral and physiological processes. Here, we investigated the evolutionary characteristics of these receptors across Drosophila species. We found that OA receptors are generally found as single-copy genes. Notably, Oct2R and Oct3R exhibit positive selection within the melanogaster group, though in different structural regions from one another. The positively selected sites in Oct2R are exclusively located in regions important for ligand binding, whereas those in Oct3R are predominantly found in regions crucial for signal transduction. Interestingly, Oct2R remains highly conserved outside the melanogaster group, so the detection of positive selection in its ligand-binding related domains within this clade raises the possibility that it has evolved an additional, melanogaster-specific ligand interaction(s), among other potential reasons. These findings highlight the evolutionary flexibility of aminergic signaling and suggest lineage-specific adaptations of OA receptor function in Drosophila, likely shaped by lineage-specific selective pressures.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Epigenetic modifications are a candidate for this regulation and may further drive age-related behavioral decline, as they are dramatically altered in the aging brain. We found that multiple components of the SET1/COMPASS complex, a conserved histone methyltransferase complex associated with active gene transcription, are upregulated with age in the C. elegans nervous system. Neuronal knockdown of the SET1/COMPASS components improves memory in young adult animals and slows memory decline in old animals. By pharmacological and genetic inhibition, optogenetics, and neuronal mRNA and chromatin profiling, we demonstrate that SET1/COMPASS-mediated active transcription promotes forgetting. SET1/COMPASS regulates the de novo activity-dependent transcription and release of a neuropeptidergic signal from the AWC olfactory sensory neuron, which erases the associative memory trace in downstream motor neurons, resulting in forgetting. We further found that increased SET1/COMPASS-dependent chromatin accessibility at these gene loci with age primes these loci for transcription, resulting in accelerated forgetting. Our results reveal the role of active gene transcription in the regulation of forgetting and altered SET1/COMPASS- mediated gene transcription as a mechanism of cognitive decline, implicating increased expression of COMPASS components as a driver of increased forgetting in the aging brain.

Meanwhile, these global changes are reshaping native plant communities, potentially weakening their biotic resistance to invasion. Yet, the role of native community resistance in modulating the upslope spread of non-native species remains overlooked, potentially masking indirect effects of global change in mountain ecosystems. Location Central Apennines Mountain range, Italy Methods Following the Mountain Invasion Research Network (MIREN) protocol, we surveyed vegetation close and far from roads at 60 sites along three mountain roads in the Central Apennines. Using current and historical climatic data and aerial images from the 1950s to today, we quantified climate and land-use changes. Dominant plant traits and functional diversity were used to capture the biotic resistance of native communities. We then applied structural equation modelling to investigate how native biotic resistance regulates the effect of global change drivers, i.e. road disturbance and changes in land-use and climate, on the occurrence and cover of non-native species. Results Variance partitioning suggests that, beside climatic filtering, the biotic resistance of native communities is among the strongest drivers of non-native species occurrence and abundance. Although climate and land-use changes have had little direct influence on non-natives, land-use changes occurred over the past 70 years indirectly influenced invasions by altering native community resistance. Agricultural abandonment at low- to middle elevations, favoured short-statured native communities, offering low resistance. In contrast, forest expansion strengthened resistance through dominance of conservative native species. Main conclusion Native community resistance, alongside climate and disturbance, is a key determinant of invasion patterns along elevational gradients in Mediterranean mountains. Despite global changes facilitate non-native plant upward shifts, native communities can modulate this spread and may still maintain a certain resistance to invasion.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Several computational models have been proposed to explain how this phenomenon could contribute to memory consolidation and action planning. However, certain aspects of the mechanism behind hippocampal replay remain unclear, such as why reactivation is biased towards both reward sites and decision points. Here, we propose that both expected reward (satisfying hunger) and expected information gain (satisfying curiosity) contribute to determine the priority of events to be replayed. To test this, we present the Epistemic Replay Algorithm (ERA), which bridges reinforcement learning and active inference into a single computational model. We evaluate the ERA in five experiments spanning three maze types: linear maze, non-stationary maze, double T-maze. Our results first showcase that more curious agents explore more thoroughly while they are still capable of exploiting optimal rewards; and they can adapt faster to changing environments. Further, we find that the ERA model accounts for a larger number of hippocampal replay properties compared to non-curious models, including (i) a broad-to-specific progression of hippocampal replay events; (ii) symmetric replay around decision points; and (iii) the preferential reactivation of both reward sites and decision points.

A difference in either type of measure (between two experimental conditions) is typically interpreted to reflect a difference in attentional resources. However, it is not a given that these various reactive and proactive measures of attention all read out the same construct; they may very well tap into independent processes. Here, we measure some of these proactive and reactive signatures of attending a location (changes in cortical excitability as measured by RIFT, alpha lateralization, gaze bias, probe-evoked ERPs, and behavioral reports) in an EEG-eyetracking task (n=23). Though all these metrics indeed correlate with our attentional manipulation, we show that they are not direct correlates of each other, and that of all the proactive measures only the gaze bias predicts subsequent behavioral responses.

Here, using fibre photometry and optogenetics during ethologically relevant social interactions, we show that CRHPVN neurons exhibit a rapid, transient increase in activity that precedes sniffing, an investigative behaviour through which mice gather social information. This transient signal scales with social context: it is heightened during interactions with unfamiliar and aggressive conspecifics and significantly reduced toward familiar partners. Inhibiting these neurons selectively diminished anogenital sniffing, demonstrating their necessity for optimal social evaluation. Strikingly, across repeated exposures to the same conspecific, behavioural investigation declined while CRHPVN activity remained robust, revealing a dissociation between neuronal and behavioural habituation. This persistence suggests that CRHPVN neurons encode stable neural representation of threat during social encounters.

Visual speech cues (e.g., lip movements) can enhance this CTS, but it remains unclear whether other non-auditory sensory cues, such as tactile input, provide comparable benefits through similar neural mechanisms. Here, using magnetoencephalography, we quantified syllabic (4-8 Hz) and phrasal (<1 Hz) CTS while participants attended to connected speech alone, together with synchronous or asynchronous speech-based vibrations, or with the corresponding speaker video, in both quiet and a multi-talker background noise. We hypothesized that, in noise, speech-based vibrotactile stimulation improves comprehension by enhancing CTS and modulating auditory-seeded functional brain connectivity with extra-auditory neocortical brain areas. Results revealed that synchronous vibrotactile stimulation improved comprehension in multi-talker noise and increased syllabic CTS at right auditory cortex, with this CTS increase magnitude correlating with comprehension performance. Audio-tactile CTS enhancement was accompanied by stronger beta-band auditory cortex connectivity with ipsilateral angular and ventral inferior temporal gyri, alongside reduced alpha-band coupling with the precuneus.

Demanding syntactic processing engaged regions across the semantic control network (SCN), including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and insula (particularly on the left), left posterior temporal cortex (posterior superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus), and bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.

Biological environments are volatile, which can cause decision-makers to be uncertain about what actions lead to rewards or punishments. Evidence on how uncertainty in action-outcome distributions impacts endogenous pain modulation is lacking. In the present study, we extend and adapt a well-established paradigm for the study of endogenous pain modulation with the implementation of a reversal learning outcome schedule. Thirty healthy human volunteers took part in this probabilistic gambling task, where they had to gamble for the obtainment of pain relief and the avoidance of pain punishments. Using a computational approach, we show that decision-making in a situation of acute pain is best explained by models that account for uncertainty. Such uncertainty is associated with the observed pain modulation in the task, indicating that endogenous pain modulation may be sensitive to volatility and the perception of uncertainty. Specifically, pain inhibition from winning pain relief increases as a function of certainty in what actions lead to pain relief. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering mechanisms of uncertainty processing in reinforcement learning from painful outcomes and endogenous pain modulation. Those mechanisms could be relevant to understanding behavioral changes in chronic pain, where altered reinforcement learning has already been established.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Humans can adapt to large and sudden perturbations of sensory feedback. What multisensory and motor-execution cues are used to determine confidence in action success, and do the dynamics of confidence parallel those of ongoing sensorimotor adaptation? Participants made a slicing reach through a visual target with an unseen hand, followed by a continuous judgment of confidence in reach success. For the confidence judgment, participants adjusted the size of an arc centered on the target. Larger arcs reflected lower confidence. Points were awarded if the subsequent visual feedback was within the arc, and fewer points returned for larger arcs. This incentivized attentive reporting of confidence and minimizing feedback-target distance to maximize the score. After the confidence response, visual feedback of hand position was shown at the same distance along the reach as the target. A 20 deg rotation was applied to the feedback during the central 50 trials of a block (alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise across blocks). We used least-squares cross validation to compare four Bayesian-inference models of sensorimotor confidence using prospective cues (knowledge of motor noise and visual feedback from past performance), retrospective cues (proprioceptive measurements), or both sources of information integrated to maximize expected gain (an ideal observer) with additional parameters for learning and bias. All but one of the participants used proprioception to calculate sensorimotor confidence during motor adaptation in addition to prior information. Confidence recovered exponentially to pre-adaptation levels after the perturbation ended, but at a slower rate than motor learning.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

While previous research has largely focused on learned fear paradigms, these approaches fail to capture the complexity of naturalistic threats. It remains poorly understood how social context-and particularly dominance hierarchy, a defining feature of many social species-modulates defensive strategies under ethologically relevant conditions. To address this question, we investigated the social modulation of innate fear in mice exposed to two ethologically relevant threats: a transient visual looming stimulus and a sustained live rat. Pair-housed mice with established dominance ranks were tested alone or with their social partner, and their behaviors were quantitatively analyzed. We found that social presence alleviates threat-induced stress and modulates defensive behaviors in a rank- and threat-specific manner: during looming exposure, it reduces immediate defensive responses and alleviates post-looming anxiety, with dominants showing greater benefit; during rat exposure, it promotes a shift from passive to active defense, again most prominently in dominants. Furthermore, threat exposure reinforces social roles and enhances group cohesion. Together, these findings demonstrate how dominance hierarchy modulates defensive responses to distinct naturalistic threats and, in turn, how threat experience shapes social behavior, providing a framework for probing the neural basis of socially modulated innate fear.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of 73 research papers on eCO2 in cucumbers was conducted, and their photosynthesis, growth, and yield were analysed. In summary, under conditions of elevated CO2 levels, the net photosynthetic rate, biomass, and yield of cucumbers exhibited a marked increase of 56.31%, 27.75%, and 21.98%, respectively. Concurrently, stomatal conductance and transpiration rate exhibited a decline of 36.07% and 30.42%, respectively. In the context of the implementation of eCO2 at varying levels within a production environment, the prevailing recommendation pertains to the range of 800-1200 ppm. It is advised that this be integrated with elevated light intensity, augmented temperature, suitable humidity levels, and a sufficient supply of fertiliser to achieve a synergistic effect.

Such pre-stimulus fluctuations may shape visual performance, yet it remains unclear whether they only affect perceptual sensitivity or decision processes in near-threshold tasks, or instead influence the temporal availability of sensory information even for highly visible stimuli. We tested whether pupil-linked arousal modulates iconic memory, a high-capacity but short-lived visual store bridging sensory encoding and short-term memory. Based on a model in which a brief stimulus evokes an internal response decaying over a few hundred milliseconds, we hypothesized that increased arousal enhances performance either by amplifying the initial response or by slowing its decay. Thirty-seven participants viewed brief displays of six oriented stimuli, followed by a cue after a variable stimulus-cue onset asynchrony indicating which item to report. Pre-stimulus pupil diameter was continuously recorded, and behavioral data were fitted with an exponential decay function estimating initial stimulus availability, decay rate, and asymptotic performance. Larger pre-stimulus pupil dilation was associated with higher initial stimulus availability but faster decay of the iconic trace, while information transferred into short-term memory and confidence ratings remained unaffected. These findings demonstrate that spontaneous fluctuations in arousal shape the temporal dynamics of sensory persistence. Elevated arousal boosts the initial strength of visual representations but shortens their duration, suggesting that arousal adaptively prioritizes rapid updating of visual input over prolonged stability.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

This study investigated how semantic and lower-level visual characteristics of urban scenes influence subjective experience and underlying neural processes. A total of 63 adults viewed street-level photographs depicting Berlin environments with varying proportions of vegetation, buildings, vehicles, and sky visibility while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Subjective ratings indicated that urban scenes with more greenery compared to built elements were consistently perceived as more positive. In terms of lower-level image features, images with higher non-straight edge density also led to scenes being perceived as more positive. In contrast, more visible sky area and a higher mean metric depth led to more negative scene appraisal. On a neural level, urban scenes with higher greenery/built ratios enhanced visual evoked P1 amplitudes, while higher straight-edge density led to more pronounced N1 amplitudes. Further analysis showed that later P3 and LPP components predicted subjective ratings on higher-level evaluative but not basic affective dimensions. These results partially replicate previous studies, suggesting that urban greenery exerts an effect on subjective well-being and influences early visual processing.

Because only 1.5% of the human genome encodes proteins, whereas the vast majority of transcripts belong to the largely unexplored non-coding RNAome, elucidating the functions of non-coding RNAs provides an unprecedented opportunity to expand the space for therapeutic discovery. We recently identified the glia-enriched lncRNA 3222401L13Rik as upregulated in the aging mouse hippocampus. Here, we investigated its function in microglia and its human homolog ENSG00000272070. We found that 3222401L13Rik is expressed in both astrocytes and microglia and increases with age. Knockdown of 3222401L13Rik in primary microglia led to enhanced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFalpha, and increased phagocytic activity. RNA sequencing revealed widespread transcriptional changes enriched for TNF and complement signaling pathways. The human homolog ENSG00000272070 showed conserved functions in iPSC-derived microglia, where its loss similarly promoted inflammatory gene expression and phagocytosis. Mechanistically, 3222401L13Rik interacts with the microglial transcription factor PU.1, and its depletion overlapped with PU.1-driven transcriptional programs. Consistent with these findings, ENSG00000272070 expression was significantly reduced in postmortem Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, and AD-associated genes were enriched among 3222401L13Rik-regulated targets.

Prediction errors, the deviation between expected and actual stimuli, are believed to mediate the competition between updating and differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we present a new analysis of experimental studies (Boeltzig, Liedtke, & Schubotz, 2025; Liedtke et al., 2025) that examine recognition memory and cued recall of similar conversations. The original version was recognized more confidently than the modified version, and the recognition confidence for modified versions showed a U-shaped dependence on the prediction error. Furthermore, the larger the prediction error, the more frequently participants retrieved two versions during cued recall. To account for these results, we propose a computational model based on a modified Hopfield network, which encodes the original and modified versions sequentially and weights the encoding of new patterns by the prediction error. The model shows that (1) similar new memories interfere with previous ones (updating) while dissimilar ones are stored separately (differentiation), (2) interference from similar representations leads to reduced memory accuracy and lower-confidence recognition, and (3) the encoding weight must be modulated by the prediction error to account for the experimental data.

However, in some commonly farmed, exterminated, and studied insect orders such as Blattodea (cockroaches and termites), the ability to make motivational trade-offs is unconfirmed, which makes it difficult to assess their welfare needs. Here we gave cockroaches a choice between access to shelter or nutrition across a series of linked experiments to assess how motivational trade-offs are flexibly adjusted due to external conditions and injury and develop across ontogeny. We found cockroaches would adjust how willing they were to access nutrition instead of shelter based on the intensity of the light they would be exposed to and how long they had been deprived of food. They can therefore make flexible motivational trade-offs. We also found that injury reduces willingness to accept light exposure when accessing nutrition, which is consistent with the idea of the sensation of pain reducing risk-taking behaviour. Finally, we showed that juvenile cockroaches can make motivational trade-offs, but only towards the end of their development, and that young juveniles do not trade-off. All together our results provide comprehensive evidence that cockroaches can make highly flexible motivational trade-offs, filling in a gap in our understanding of cognitive abilities in insects linked to their ability to feel pain.

Methods: Modeling ultrasound wave propagation and intensities using the finite element method (FEM). Cavitation onset was experimentally validated in a pressure chamber observed with a high-speed camera. The thermal effects of ultrasound energy were estimated through established physical and thermal models and confirmed in a cuvette setup using thermistor probes. Results: At the distal end of the PCS tip, the ultrasound wave intensity reached 0.2 W/mm2, resulting in ocular tissue displacements in the anterior chamber below 2 m. The temperature rise in the anterior chamber was less than 0.2 {degrees}C/s. Both observations indicate negligible mechanical and thermal risk to ocular tissues. High-speed imaging confirmed cavitation confined to the tip region. Emulsification efficacy was maintained even under conditions that suppressed cavitation, including elevated ambient pressures and cavitation-inhibiting fluids. Results indicate that mechanical fragmentation by tip oscillation (jackhammer effect) is the only relevant emulsification mechanism, while cavitation plays a negligible role. Acoustic streaming was observed during ultrasound excitation without phaco sleeve. During phacoemulsification, the sleeve suppressed acoustic streaming into the anterior chamber.

Millions of RNA-seq datasets have accumulated in public databases such as the Sequence Read Archive-SRA.

Results: To address these issues, we introduce Metappuccino: a metadata enrichment tool based on a fine-tuned Mistral-7B-Instruct large language model with low-rank-adaptation (LoRA). Metappuccino can extract or infer 19 key metadata classes (e.g. organ, disease, cell type) from unstructured text. Fine-tuning was conducted with careful partitioning and training design to preserve the model's generalisation capacity, reduce data leakage, and ensure robust, context-aware inference rather than memorisation. When possible, the inferred outputs are mapped to standardised ontologies, such as Cellosaurus, Disease Ontology and Uberon, to produce consistent metadata. As a result, the fine-tuned model achieves significantly improved class prediction accuracy over the base model, performing at least as well as recent large open-source models. Furthermore, it reduces inference time by up to at least two compared to the baseline models. As a pipeline, Metappuccino complements the LLM with well-established Natural Language Processing techniques from the literature to further improve performance. By enriching the metadata of under-annotated sequences, Metappuccino creates greater value from public RNA-seq datasets, with potential applications extending beyond oncology transcriptomics.

V.", "abstract": "AL amyloidosis is a rapidly progressive disorder characterized by clonal plasma cell expansion, excessive production of light chains (LCs), and their misfolding into aggregation-prone monomers. These monomers assemble into oligomers and ultimately deposit as amyloid fibrils, particularly within cardiac tissue, where they contribute to myocardial stiffening and direct cardiotoxicity. A mechanistic model was developed to quantify the interplay between these two pathogenic processes and to examine the kinetics of LC aggregation in different compartments. Simulations reveal that LC aggregation exhibits pronounced nonlinearity: oligomer concentrations remain low during early disease stages, followed by exponential growth driven by autocatalytic conversion. When aggregation is assumed to occur within cardiac tissue, fibril deposition is approximately 25 times greater, and oligomer-induced cardiotoxicity is about five times higher, compared with aggregation occurring in the blood plasma. These differences stem from the smaller cardiac volume, which accelerates autocatalytic oligomer formation. A combined cardiac damage criterion, integrating both oligomer-induced cardiotoxicity and fibril-associated myocardial stiffening, was introduced and found to reach values approximately tenfold higher when LC aggregation occurs within cardiac tissue compared with aggregation in the blood plasma. This parameter may serve as a quantitative measure of cardiac aging or disease severity.

This study had three objectives, first, as a test of the Hensen model, second, as a potential model for a disease for which no mouse or cell model currently exists, and finally, as a test of chromosomal configuration to interrogate large genomic regions carrying an unknown phenotypic modifier. We crossed an SDH gene knockout line to a Robertsonian (Rb) chromosome line harbouring the gene imprinting centre implicated in human tumourigenesis, to create a metacentric chromosome with characteristics of human chromosome 11. Distinct phenotypes were noted in various cohorts. In heterozygote Rb mice we noted both weight gain and frequent immune activation. In Sdhc knockout mice with both heterozygous and homozygous Rb chromosomes, thyroid abnormalities, including papillary thyroid carcinoma-like tumours, were common due to apparent synergy between the Sdhc KO and the Rb chromosome. We also found a single case of bilateral pheochromocytoma in which loss of Sdhc was not the driver. Although few studies of Robertsonian chromosomes in the mouse have addressed pathology or phenotype, this study suggests that chromosomal structure can dramatically impact clinical phenotype.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

R.; Verma, T.; Rana, A.; Sen, R.; Raychoudhury, R.", "abstract": "External genitalia play a crucial role in the successful copulation of conspecific partners in insects. Due to their structural specificity, external genitalia have often been used for distinguishing closely related species in different insects. However, in the young Pteromalid species complex Nasonia, these structures have not received much attention. Nasonia is a genus of parasitoid wasps, that lays eggs and completes its life cycle in dipteran pupae. All behavioral studies (including this study) conducted on this genus indicate that varied prezygotic isolation operates among these recently diverged (~1 million years) species. Whether such prezygotic isolation is caused by the incompatibility in their reproductive organs is not known. Here, we studied the internal male reproductive system of the four species and show that all four species have a similar organisation and thus ruling it out as a potential barrier. Furthermore, to investigate the role of male external genitalia as a prezygotic barrier, we also examined the ultrastructural details, including aedeagal length, aedeagal aperture length, and digital spines. We show that all these parameters and sperm length show variations across the four species. However, these variations do not correlate with the female acceptance of the heterospecific males. Therefore, we conclude that there must be other olfactory or behavioral isolating mechanisms and spatial or temporal factors that maintain the reproductive isolation of these four species.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

However, how neurons of diverse functions and connectivity reorganize and modulate their activities to generate coherent changes while preserving essential functions is not well understood. Here, we address this question using an aversive olfactory learning paradigm whereby Caenorhabditis elegans learns to reduce its olfactory preference for pathogenic bacteria. Using functional imaging during olfactory stimulation in naive and trained animals, we show that, at brain-wide scale, cell type-by-cell type, learning induces context-gated reconfiguration of the organization of neural activity throughout the brain to alter neural responses only during bacteria-discrimination task, while leaving intact bacteria-sensing functions. We found that the context-gated encoding of learning is globally distributed across layers of the nervous system, composed of neurons carrying information of context or learning experience. In particular, aversive training modulates multiple functional connections within the nervous system, including those between sensory neurons and interneurons, as well as those among interneurons, in a context-gated manner. At the systems level, training modulates correlated activity of neural populations; we found that low-dimensional temporal patterns of population activity correlate well with locomotory gaits that express olfactory preferences. Upon training, the rotation and contraction of the low-dimensional neural manifolds shifts the brain into predisposed states for the context-gated display of learned behavior. Because animals encounter unpredictable environments in life, efficient learning about relevant cues while maintaining other functions is essential for survival. Our findings uncover network-level mechanisms that help explain how the brain reorganizes its activity patterns to both encode new experience and preserve essential functions.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

However, stimulation artifacts in EEG and MEG recordings severely hinder the study of its online effects. Approach: Here, we introduce a new approach to account for these artifacts. The approach rests on two key ideas. First, we focus on interactions of tCS with intrinsic brain activity, which are absent for tCS artifacts. Second, rather than removing artifacts, we compare composite signals that share similar artifacts but potentially differ in the interaction of tCS with intrinsic brain activity. We follow a simple logic: if tCS does not interact with intrinsic brain activity, then neural activity during simultaneous sensory stimulation and tCS should equal the linear superposition of the neural effects of each applied alone. Any deviation from this prediction provides evidence for a neural interaction. Main results: We tested this approach in a proof-of-principle MEG study, applying 10 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) during rest and during a 10 Hz visual flicker. We compared neural activity during simultaneous stimulation with that predicted by the linear superposition of flicker and tACS alone and found a phase-dependent interaction between tACS and flicker-evoked brain activity. Significance: Our work establishes a novel approach to investigate online effects of tCS and suggests a state-dependent interaction of tACS with human brain activity.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "DNA end resection is a critical step in DNA damage repair and activation of the DNA damage checkpoint (DDC). To date, resection has been studied primarily in bulk cell populations. However, single-cell analyses are essential for uncovering cell-to-cell variability and can powerfully support or contradict system-level models where traditional genetic perturbations face limitations. We present a single-cell method to quantify resection by integrating an optogenetic expression system at defined distances from an inducible double-strand DNA break (DSB) site in the budding yeast genome. Using this system, we test competing, unresolved models of how the DDC 'counts' DSBs and determines when to override the checkpoint. Current models propose that the extent of DNA damage is signaled by resection, either through liberated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or proteins bound along the non-resected strand. Although mechanistically plausible and widely known, these models rely on inconclusive evidence from gene knockout studies. An alternative hypothesis is that the DDC counts DSBs digitally, using factors located at 3' break ends or at ss/dsDNA junctions. Here, we leverage natural cell-to-cell variability in resection rates as an intrinsic perturbation, avoiding the limitations of prior genetic approaches. Our single-cell data challenge models in which DNA damage is inferred from the extent or rate of resection or from proteins bound along resected DNA. To explore alternative mechanisms, we investigated DDC proteins localized at 3' DSB ends or ss/dsDNA boundaries. By dynamically depleting candidate proteins after checkpoint arrest, we identified ss/dsDNA boundary proteins Ddc1, Dpb11, and Rad9 as essential for DDC maintenance and promising candidates for a cascade that acts as a digital DSB counter.

{"title": "Individual-level contextual alignment and aperiodic slope reveal improved comprehension of unexpected language", "doi": "10.1101/2025.10.28.685236", "authors": "Platt, A. L. M.", "abstract": "In everyday language use, individuals are required to comprehend complex, continuous and often unexpected linguistic inputs to effectively communicate with others. Evidence from other domains of processing such as memory and learning suggest that individuals these unexpected inputs can often be remembered or learnt just as well as predictable inputs in follow up testing. However, language comprehension research often focuses on how individuals process these stimuli rather than how the information which is gathered can be used at a later time. It is proposed that, in line with memory and learning, individuals can utilise unexpected language inputs to support a deeper understanding of the information which is being communicated. Further, this will be related to the interaction between an individual's alignment to local context and inter-individual differences in information processing, such as aperiodic slope. The present study uses an alignment metric which measures the relationship between individual level N400 amplitudes (a neurophysiological metric of predictability) and surprisal (a text-collection-based metric of predictability), where higher alignment suggests the individual has a stronger preexisting schema. A steeper aperiodic slope has been suggested to reflect greater adaptation of predictive models in response to prediction errors; therefore, it is hypothesised that depth of language comprehension will be modulated by both alignment and aperiodic slope. To explore this, 30 participants (23F, 1 not reported; mean age: 22.2 years [SD:4.4]) listened to 12 short stories (3 genres, audio-visual presentation) while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Comprehension was tested via 6 multiple choice questions per story. An additional combined analysis, including a reanalysis of 40 audio-modality participants, provided evidence across both modalities that comprehension was improved for more surprising stories. Further, when considering inter-individual differences, the relationship between predictability and comprehension was shown to be modulated by both alignment and aperiodic activity. Comprehension of unexpected stories (as measured by N400 amplitudes) was improved only for lower aligned, steeper aperiodic slope individuals. This finding is considered a reflection of complementary processing strategies which are weighted towards incoming stimuli, increasing the likelihood of model updating and therefore resulting in improved comprehension of unexpected stories.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

G.; Robinson, E.", "abstract": "Background: Behavioural studies in animal models represent a critical component of psychiatric drug development. Positive results in animal studies have identified novel therapeutic targets for major depressive disorder (MDD) but efficacy in humans has largely not been borne out in clinical trials. A possible reason for this failed translation is inappropriate dose selection and the engagement of mechanisms not directly relevant to antidepressant effects in patients. Methods: We first used PubMed to identify preclinical rodent studies in two assays used to assess antidepressants; the conventional forced swim test, (FST) and more recently developed affective bias test, (ABT). Dose ranges were extracted, as well as information about subjects, timing and route of administration, and justification and efficacy of dose(s). Dose ranges were compared against calculated animal equivalent doses. Results: The median FST dose across all antidepressants was 10mg/kg, with median doses for each drug exceeding the relevant animal equivalent dose by 1.5-25x. In contrast, effective doses in the ABT showed closer alignment to those used clinically. In the second study, 232 ketamine and 202 fluoxetine papers involving MDD-related research in rodents were reviewed. The median dose was 10mg/kg for both drugs, exceeding animal equivalent doses by 1.6-3.2x and 3.2-6.5x for ketamine and fluoxetine, respectively. Conclusions: The results indicate pervasive use of antidepressant doses in conventional models of MDD that may not correspond with doses used in clinical practice. We discuss the implications of using doses which exceed therapeutic levels and the potential to engage receptors and underlying mechanisms which are not relevant to clinical effects.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

We show that, in addition to prominent spindle pole localization, TPXL-1-AurA has a chromatin-associated pool positioned between the sister kinetochores. Structural modeling and biochemical analysis support TPXL-1 directly recognizing the nucleosome acidic patch via an arginine anchor. Disrupting this interaction selectively removed chromatin-bound TPXL-1-AurA and caused chromosome missegregation, whereas elevation of the chromatin pool disrupted chromosome alignment. These opposing perturbations inversely affected kinetochore recruitment of the microtubule-binding Ska complex. These results support spatially distinct TPXL-1-AurA populations acting sequentially, with the spindle pole pool controlling spindle length by switching kinetochores out of a depolymerization-coupled state, and the chromatin pool controlling attachment stabilization to ensure biorientation prior to anaphase.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Quantitative cell surface proteomics reveal that glucose deprivation remodels the cell surface proteome, notably reducing surface expression of key adhesion molecules. This nutrient-sensitive reprogramming enhances cell migration in vitro and promotes metastasis in vivo.

Bacillus altitudinis ECC22, previously shown to produce the circular bacteriocins pumilarin and altitudin A, was found to harbor an additional biosynthetic gene cluster encoding a novel circular bacteriocin, designated altitudin S Proteomic analysis of active supernatant fractions confirmed the production of altitudin S, with a molecular mass of 8379 Da, consistent with head-to-tail cyclization. The peptide is synthesized as a 132-residue precursor comprising a 56-amino-acid leader and a 76-residue circular mature core. Structural modeling predicted a compact saposin-like fold composed of five -helices and a strongly cationic surface (pI {approx} 11.0, net charge +13). Altitudin S was successfully produced using a cell-free protein synthesis system coupled to split-intein mediated ligation (IV-CFPS/SIML) and exhibited a narrow but reproducible antimicrobial spectrum. Comprehensive sequence, structural, and phylogenetic analyses revealed that altitudin S is a highly divergent circular bacteriocin, defined by distinctive sequence features and physicochemical properties, including an exceptionally high isoelectric point, net charge, and low hydrophobicity. Bioprospecting across sequence databases identified homologs of altitudin S in diverse Bacillales species, all showing high sequence similarity, conserved structural features and preservation of its distinctive physicochemical profile. Genomic analysis further revealed a conserved biosynthetic gene cluster among all altitudin S homologs, notably including a gene encoding a characteristic M48-family metallopeptidase.

When challenged nasally with a H1N1HH4/09/H1N1Vic/19 6:2 reassortant virus encoding the HA and NA antigens of H1N1Vic/19, immunized pigs did not shed infectious virus while the control animals did, suggesting that homologous prime/boost vaccination with H1/N1 replicon particles can block virus replication in the upper respiratory tract as efficiently as the heterologous RNA replicon prime/LAIV boost immunization regimen. In conclusion, RNA replicons encoding both HA and NA either used alone or in combination with LAIV mediate protection against antigen-drifted influenza viruses and reduce the risk of vaccination breakthroughs due to antigen mismatch. Furthermore, this vaccine may also limit the infection by zoonotic H5N1 viruses.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

All pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum), for example, carry the obligate nutritional symbiont Buchnera, while most have one or more of the seven heritable facultative symbionts, which play diverse roles. A common symbiont, Hamiltonella defensa, confers protection against the parasitic wasp Aphidius ervi via a toxin-bearing bacteriophage called APSE, with strain-level variation in protection best predicted by APSE variant. Yet, little is known about Hamiltonella/APSE strain variation in the field, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the full arsenal of symbiont defenses and how these change over space and time. Here, we characterized Hamiltonella/APSE diversity in over 3,000 field-collected aphids from two North American populations across multiple years. We identified bacterial strains representing five Hamiltonella clades, seven APSE variants, and numerous toxin alleles, resulting in at least 38 distinct combinations. We found that APSEs moved laterally among Hamiltonella strains more readily than toxins among phage backbones, together generating modular defensive diversity. Hamiltonella strains exhibited strain-specific coinfection preferences with other symbionts, particularly Fukatsuia, Rickettsia, and Rickettsiella, indicating strain-level structuring of heritable bacterial communities. Geographic and temporal analyses revealed dramatic regional differences and rapid population turnover, with combinations conferring intermediate laboratory protection dominating despite the decline of highly protective strains, suggesting ecological success goes beyond parasitoid resistance alone. This extensive cryptic diversity provides standing genetic variation enabling rapid evolutionary responses to biological control efforts and anthropogenic stressors, including climate change, with implications for pest management and host adaptation.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

The ssSNPBLUP model integrates phenotypic, pedigree, and genomic data for genomic evaluations. However, there has been no framework for estimating the reliability and p-values of the SNP effects obtained from a ssSNPBLUP genomic model. This study investigates the reliability and significance of the SNP effects estimates estimated using a ssSNPBLUP framework in German Limousin (LIM) and Holstein (HOL) cattle populations. Methods This study introduces a novel approach for calculating p-values within the ssSNPBLUP framework and compares it to a conventional single-marker regression GWAS approach. SNP reliabilities were computed using prediction error variances of SNP effect estimates, enabling the identification of statistically significant SNP markers. LIM data included weaning weight (200-DW) evaluated with a maternal effect BLUP model, while HOL data comprised production traits (milk yield, protein yield, fat yield, and somatic cell score) analysed via a random regression test-day model. Results The results reveal significant SNP effects in both LIM and HOL evaluations, with notable differences attributed to the size of the reference populations.

In addition to the major capsid protein, L1, the 4-valent HPV vaccine reportedly also contains recombinant L1 DNA. Nucleic acids in vaccines can enhance antibody responses, but whether L1 DNA enhances HPV vaccine antibody responses is understudied. We tested whether 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine lots contained L1 DNA and if peak or long-term 9vHPV vaccine-elicited nAb responses were dependent on DNA sensors TLR9, AIM2, or cGAS, or STING or MyD88, the adaptors for cGAS and TLR9, respectively. To quantify L1 DNA, we extracted total nucleic acid per 9vHPV dose and applied singleplex quantitative PCR to amplify HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 L1 sequences. Wildtype mice (wt; C57BL/6J) or mice deficient in DNA sensing pathways (TLR9-/-, AIM2-/-, cGAS-/-, STINGgt/gt, MyD88-/-) were administered 9vHPV vaccine or equivalent adjuvant only at 0, 4, and 12 weeks. We measured serum HPV16 and HPV18 nAb titers at 16, 26, 40, and 53-56 weeks and HPV16- and HPV18-specific bone marrow plasma cell responses at 53-56 weeks. We detected 5-44 and 104-351 copies of HPV6 and HPV18 L1 DNA per 9vHPV vaccine dose, but no other types (n=3 lots).

In order to address this we have developed plaque-2-sequence, a robust and cost-effective workflow for high-throughput phage genome sequencing that will transform the speed and cost of attaining phage genomes. Plaque-2-sequence combines low-input transposase-based library preparation, amplification, nanopore sequencing and optimised assembly steps tailored to phage genomes. We applied the method to phages isolated on seven genetically diverse bacterial hosts; Escherichia, Pseudomonas, Synechococcus, Enterococcus, Klebsiella , Serratia and Enterobacter. High quality genome assemblies were validated using CheckV and benchmarking against previously sequenced phage isolates. Compared to standard Illumina sequencing, plaque-2-sequence offers ~10-fold savings in sequencing price for individual labs. Furthermore, it substantially decreases the time required to produce a phage genome, once a plaque is obtained. Offering the ability to routinely obtain hundreds of phage genome sequences a week, with minimal hands-on time.

Here, we reveal that two HSP90 inhibitors targeting the identical ATP-binding site exhibit dramatically different resistance profiles in P. falciparum. Geldanamycin readily selected 10 distinct resistance mutations conferring up to 22-fold resistance, while AUY-922 required 44 weeks to yield a single A41S mutation with only 2-fold resistance to AUY-922 but not to geldanamycin. Resistance mapping in parasites and yeast revealed geldanamycin resistance mutations distributed throughout the binding pocket whereas AUY-922 resistance mutations localized close to the ATP-binding site. Unexpectedly, the A41S mutation enhanced AUY-922 binding affinity without changing geldanamycin binding. In silico analysis suggested this enhancement occurs through additional hydrogen bonding, yet stronger binding correlated with resistance. In yeast, A41S had opposite effects, hypersensitizing cells to all HSP90 inhibitors tested. Additionally, conditional HSP90 knockdown increased geldanamycin sensitivity but left AUY-922 activity unaffected, indicating different target dependencies despite shared binding sites. Based on these data, we propose a multi-target hypothesis where AUY-922's lower resistance risk stems from engaging multiple HSP90 family members. Our findings reveal how enhanced drug-target binding can paradoxically correlate with resistance and demonstrate that resistance risk cannot be predicted from binding site identity alone, providing insights for developing more durable drugs across therapeutic areas.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

However, the bacterial determinants required for survival within the central nervous system (CNS) are poorly understood. Here, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen (CRISPRi-Seq) in an in vivo zebrafish model to systematically map pneumococcal fitness determinants during meningitis. Using this approach, we investigated essential and non-essential genes contributing to the pathogenesis of pneumococcal meningitis. The screen identified 244 loci whose repression significantly reduced bacterial fitness in vivo, representing pathways involved in virulence, metabolism, cell-envelope biogenesis, translation, and stress adaptation. Comparative analysis with in vitro datasets showed that metabolic genes such as purA, proABC, thrC, glyA, and manLMN, as well as those involved in peptidoglycan and capsule biosynthesis (pbp3, cps2 operon) and oxidative stress response (nox, dpr), become selectively more essential in vivo. Functional validation confirmed that these pathways are critical for virulence, nutrient-dependent growth, and oxidative stress response during meningitis. Untargeted metabolomics of infected zebrafish corroborate several observed bacterial genetic sensitivities in the CNS with altered levels of key nutrients such as glucose and 4-aminobenzoic acid. Integration of the CRISPRi-Seq dataset with antibiotic-target annotations revealed both established and previously unrecognised vulnerabilities, including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases such as leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS), whose inhibition by the benzoxaborole epetraborole improved host survival, highlighting its potential as a new therapeutic strategy for multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. pneumoniae. Together, these findings demonstrate the power of in vivo CRISPRi-Seq to define the pneumococcal essentialome under physiological conditions and reveal that metabolic adaptation, cell-envelope maintenance, and the oxidative stress response are central to bacterial survival in the CNS. This fitness map advances our understanding of pneumococcal adaptation in the CNS and identifies promising targets for developing therapies against S. pneumoniae.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Litter samples (n = 18) were collected from three commercial broiler houses following flock removal: one control (NaHSO-only), one treated with IndigoLT for a single flock, and one treated for two consecutive flocks. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to assess prokaryotic community composition.

Core microbiome and differential abundance analyses suggested that IndigoLT, when paired with reduced NaHSO input, may accelerate organic matter decomposition, promote nitrogen retention, and suppress potentially pathogenic taxa. Although limited by the absence of baseline sampling and biological replication, these findings suggest that IndigoLT influences litter microbial succession.

However, CAST systems have not been adapted for high-throughput genetic screening. Here, we present MultiCAST, a streamlined platform for rapid and scalable guide RNA-directed transposon insertion in bacteria. MultiCAST generates targeted insertions in a single step through conjugative delivery of conditionally replicative plasmids encoding the CAST enzymatic machinery and a selectable mini-transposon expressing the guide RNA. By leveraging the inserted guide sequence as a molecular barcode, MultiCAST enables pooled, high-throughput genetic screens using only amplicon sequencing. We identified factors that influence transposition efficiency and the accuracy of insertion frequency measurements derived from guide sequencing. Adjusting the ratio of donor and recipient strain during conjugation mitigates guide-transposon crosstalk, in which a single recipient cell acquires multiple donor plasmids containing distinct guides. Furthermore, we developed a machine learning-based predictive model for selecting highly active guides based on target sequence features that strongly correlate with activity. The nucleoid-associated protein H-NS was also found to inhibit CAST activity, providing a mechanistic explanation for variable insertion frequencies among non-essential genes. To demonstrate the scalability of MultiCAST, we screened a pooled mutant population created from >5,200 guides targeting 88 genes in E. coli across twelve nutrient conditions, accurately identifying genes with condition-specific fitness effects.

While sibling presence was associated with accelerated microbiota maturation and modest compositional differences, infants who both had siblings (or both lacked siblings) were no more similar to each other than mixed pairs. Instead, infants with siblings exhibited non-specific convergence with adult microbiota profiles and contributed fewer unique genera to their family metacommunities (infant-mother-father triads).

In this study we utilized ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) to design recombinant antigens of extinct ancestral viruses to serve as vaccines against multiple modern day TBFs. We reconstructed a common ancestral envelope (E) antigen that possesses high sequence and structural identity to several modern-day TBF pathogens and engineered this ancestral E antigen sequence into an attenuated Sindbis virus vaccine platform. We observed that this Sindbis virus was replication competent and generated sustained antigen expression in vitro. Immunizing mice with this vaccine candidate resulted in the production of significant neutralizing antibody active against virulent Powassan (POWV) and Langat (LGTV) viruses. Antibody neutralization correlated well with decreased clinical signs and increased survival from virulent POWV challenge.

However, mosquito populations rapidly evolve resistance, possibly enabled by their high levels of genetic diversity. Genome-wide surveys of diversity in Ae. aegypti have focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and although structural variants such as transposable element (TE) insertions have been implicated in insecticide resistance (IR) in Drosophila, these have not been thoroughly characterized in Aedes. Here, we evaluated the TE content in 122 Ae. aegypti genomes from six countries across Africa, North, and South America. We found that TEs contribute substantially to genetic diversity and reflect population structure broadly consistent with that seen in SNPs. Although most TEs insertions are rare, some were observed at higher frequencies, suggesting that a small subset of these may be beneficial. For example, we identified numerous TEs with large frequency differences across populations, consistent with the possibility that these are in haplotypes underlying local adaptation. Specifically, we found three TEs near genes that may be involved in metabolic insecticide resistance: CYP6P12, GSTD11 and GSTZ1. In Colombian samples, we also identified a TE insertion that is in negative linkage disequilibrium with several insecticide resistance mutations that form an intermediate-frequency haplotype in the VGSC gene region.

Sequencing identified a non-synonymous substitution, G255D, in GS2.2 within a conserved region adjacent to the GFA-binding site. G255D retained ~58% of wild-type activity in vitro assays, but was completely insensitive to GFA, with no measurable inhibition at tested concentrations.

A mutational panel of GS1.1 variants showed that substitutions at E131, E192, G245, H249, R291, R311, and R332 abolished enzyme activity or inhibitor sensitivity, with most variants retaining <2% of wild-type function.

However, the mechanistic basis of biased signaling remains primarily defined based on synthetic ligands and receptor mutants with relatively limited progress in understanding naturally-encoded signaling-bias. Here, we present fundamental molecular and structural insights into naturally-encoded signaling-bias at the complement anaphylatoxin C5a receptors namely, C5aR1 and C5aR2. We first discover that C5a-d-Arg, the naturally-occurring version of C5a lacking the terminal arginine, exhibits robust G-protein signaling-bias at C5aR1, characterised by attenuated {beta}arr recruitment. This signaling-bias manifests in both cytokine release from primary human immune cells, and in vivo, during neutrophil mobilization. We combine the cryo-EM structures of C5a/C5a-d-Arg-C5aR1 complexes with MD simulation, site-directed mutagenesis, and cellular experiments to elucidate that the G-protein-bias exhibited by C5a-d-Arg results from a distinct orientation of TM7 and helix 8 in C5aR1 leading to inefficient GRK recruitment and receptor phosphorylation. Next, we determine the first cryo-EM structures of C5aR2, a naturally-encoded {beta}-arrestin-biased receptor, in an apo state, complexed with the natural agonists C5a and C5a-d-Arg, and three peptide agonists including a first-in-class, newly discovered C5aR2-selective agonist, R8Y. These structural snapshots reveal key differences between the binding of C5a and C5a-d-Arg to C5aR1 and C5aR2, and provide a molecular basis of functional specialization at these two receptors. Moreover, the structural insights also allow us to decipher the molecular basis of naturally-encoded signaling-bias at C5aR2 originating from a shallower cytoplasmic interface with hydrophobic interior pocket that is not permissive to efficient G-protein-coupling and activation. Finally, we also engineer and characterize loss-of-function and gain-of-function variants of C5aR1 and C5aR2, which in turn corroborate and validate the structural observations presented here.

However, the interaction between these caspases and other cell death modalities remains poorly understood. Here, we build on evidence that caspase-4 can engage in crosstalk with the apoptotic executioner caspases-3 and -7. Our work validated caspase-3 and -7 as direct substrates of caspase-4 and -5, and demonstrated that this specificity was regulated by exosite interactions as opposed to the tetrapeptide. Using AlphaFold, we generated an interaction model between caspase-4 and executioner caspases-3 and -7. From this, we experimentally validated the importance of a hydrophobic interface on caspase-3 and -7 that engaged the caspase-4 exosite, enabling their recognition and cleavage. Importantly, this interface is not used by the apoptotic initiator caspase-8, which cleaved caspase-3 in a tetrapeptide-dependent manner. Our work highlights that inflammatory caspases have evolved a novel mechanism to coordinate crosstalk between pyroptotic and apoptotic signalling, and suggests that these pathways may synergise for the efficient amplification of cell death pathways.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

M.; Reynoldson, T. E.; Hardege, I.", "abstract": "The pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are a deeply conserved superfamily that includes nicotinic acetylcholine (nAChR), GABAARs, glycine, and serotonin receptors and mediates fast neurotransmission. While vertebrate pLGICs have been extensively characterized, recent discoveries in invertebrates have revealed atypical members with novel ligand specificities, including dopamine-gated ion channels (dop-LGICs) that enable direct ionotropic dopaminergic signaling. Here, we investigate the molecular determinants of catecholamine sensitivity and selectivity in a cation-permeable dopamine-gated receptor from Daphnia magna (Dm-DopC1), which shares high structural homology with vertebrate nAChRs. We find that mutations in loop B (D188N) near-abolish catecholamine responses, while substitutions in loops A (S123P) and C (S227G, E230P) significantly alter sensitivity and ligand selectivity, highlighting the cooperative role of these loops in shaping receptor pharmacology. Complementary face mutations in loops D and E (N92T, A158G) further refined dopamine versus norepinephrine sensitivity. Finally, we also show that this dopamine receptor can be antagonized by both nicotinic and dopaminergic compounds, underscoring its hybrid pharmacological profile. Together, these results reveal how subtle changes in conserved binding motifs can shift receptor specificity from cholinergic to dopaminergic signaling, providing new insights into the evolutionary flexibility of pLGICs and the molecular basis of ionotropic catecholamine transmission in invertebrates.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Short RNA oligonucleotides can reverse this behavior, yet the structural determinants that govern RNA activity remain poorly defined. Here, we identify RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) as tunable structural motifs that potently modulate FUS LLPS. rG4 activity depends on its concentration and is modulated by rG4 length and stability: increasing repeat number switches rG4s from inhibitor to nucleator of FUS assembly, whereas chemical modifications that stabilize rG4 enhance inhibitory function and render these activities resilient to ionic perturbation. Although short rG4s interact with both soluble and condensed FUS, they preferentially engage the soluble pool, likely shifting the equilibrium toward dispersion. Leveraging these mechanistic insights, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline that uncovered more rG4 inhibitors that robustly reverse FUS LLPS and aggregation. Our findings establish rG4s as chemically programmable regulators of protein phase behavior and provide a blueprint for engineering RNA-based therapeutics that dissolve pathogenic FUS assemblies. More broadly, this work directly links RNA secondary structure to distinct functional outcomes in phase behavior, establishing a structure-function paradigm for RNA control of condensates, demonstrating implications in both fundamental biology and therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

However, their molecular interpretation is often limited by the inherent complexity of ligand-receptor interactions and the transient nature of binding events. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer valuable mechanistic insights in ligand binding studies, but remain computationally prohibitive for capturing the long-timescale, multiligand behavior characteristic of CBAs. Therefore, characterizing the molecular aspects of CBAs remains a fundamental challenge in molecular biophysics. Here, we introduce a coarse-grained MD (CGMD) approach capable of recapitulating CBA-like dynamics between ligands of opposing efficacy-- the full agonist NECA and the inverse agonist ZM241385-- at the adenosine A2A receptor, a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor and a key pharmacological target. By simulating ligand mixtures at varying molar ratios, we capture hallmark features of experimental CBAs, including spontaneous binding, unbinding, and direct competition at the orthosteric site. Our simulations reveal an extracellular vestibular site that modulates ligand access to the binding pocket. Occupation of this site by NECA facilitates ZM241385 entry and prolongs its residence time, revealing a cooperative mechanism within an otherwise competitive process. These findings offer a molecular perspective on ligand competition at GPCRs and demonstrate the potential of CGMD as a viable method for probing multiligand dynamics in drug discovery.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have shown unequivocally that prestin exhibits piezoelectricity in the plasma membrane. However, the mechanism by which prestin converts sound-elicited receptor potential changes into mechanical movement remains unclear. This electromechanical process entails thinning and thickening of the cell membrane, which reciprocally affects prestin's motor function. To model membrane thinning during OHC elongation, we determined multiple high-resolution structures of dolphin prestin in lipid nanodiscs of varying thicknesses using single particle cryo-electron microscopy. Membrane thinning triggered a conformational transition in prestin from the compact Sensor Up state to the expanded Sensor Down state. Combined with four mutant structures, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and patch-clamp electrophysiology, we investigated the structural dynamics of prestin's response to mechanical force stemming from the membrane. By contrasting dolphin prestin with novel structures of lizard SLC26A5 (an anion exchanger), we demonstrate how, driven by the force-from-lipids principle, prestin's motor function is distinct from nonmammalian transporter SLC26A5. Our data suggests that the anion is an inseparable part of the electromotile dolphin prestin anion binding pocket (voltage sensor), which facilitates core-gate interactions in response to mechanical stress. These structural insights offer a high-resolution understanding of how prestin translates membrane tension into charge and motor movement during sound-evoked vibrations, revealing its piezoelectric reciprocal mechanosensing as an essential property in cochlear amplification.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we develop a computational model to understand the role of MID1. Based on previously published data, our model predicts that MID1 increases the stability of the Htt RNA. We experimentally validate this prediction, showing that overexpression of MID1 significantly prolongs the half-life of mutant Htt RNA. Furthermore, we evaluate model refinements, including clustering of MID1-bound RNA, which allow capturing all key observations in the data. Together, we provide a data-driven framework that underlines the importance of RBP-RNA interaction in post-transcriptional regulation.

While the general secretory (Sec) pathway transports proteins across the membrane in an unfolded state, the twin-arginine translocation (Tat) pathway transports proteins primarily in their folded conformation. Although the Tat system appears dispensable in multiple model bacteria, some species require it for viability, and the reason for the distinction is nebulous. Here we show that all three subunits of the Tat complex -- TatA, TatB, and TatC -- are essential in the alpha-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Additionally, depletion of the Tat complex results in abnormal cell morphology. We found that localization to the cell periphery, as well as midcell localization upon osmotic upshift, of the essential peptidoglycan transpeptidase PBP2 is dependent on the Tat apparatus. In contrast, subcellular localization of the actin homolog MreB and the penicillin-binding protein PBP1a is not perturbed upon depletion of the Tat complex. PBP2 transpeptidase activity links glycan chains at sites of cell wall remodeling and is essential for cell elongation. Together these results suggest that PBP2 localization is a key responsibility of the Tat system in Caulobacter and possibly other alpha-proteobacteria.", "date": "2025-11-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that ER-mitochondria connectivity was disrupted in Pkd1- and Pkd2-deleted mice, preceding cyst formation. This disconnection induces mitochondrial stress, triggering epigenetic remodeling and transcriptional activation of pathways driving proliferation and metabolic reprogramming. Remarkably, restoring PKD function in the ER or pharmacologically enhancing ER-mitochondria connection ameliorates mitochondrial dysfunction, epigenetic shifts, and cystogenesis.

However, existing modalities remain limited by trade-offs among imaging speed, spectral capacity, depth of field (DOF), and spatial resolution.

In vivo, DEM enables simultaneous visualization of neutrophils and premalignant tumors in freely swimming zebrafish. In immobilized specimens, it provides robust, sensor-level optical sectioning near the heart, suppressing diffuse background to reveal fine vascular networks and active blood circulation into and out of the cardiac chambers. DEM further enables quantitative mapping of blood-flow dynamics in the zebrafish tail, resolving arterial venous differences and capturing heartbeat-driven oscillations that reflect cardiac pumping with high temporal fidelity.

Here we reconstruct the global history of the oral microbiome over 102,400 years using a global collection of 1854 oral samples spanning 61 countries. We reveal that major cultural transitions of the Neolithic Revolution, industrialization, and recent medical advances have driven a directional, globally coordinated co-evolution of oral microbial ecology, function, and population structure. Network analysis identifies two universal microbial modules of dental calculus modules: the commensal_enriched DCM1 module and the pathogen-enriched DCM2, both exhibiting progressive ecological polarization. DCM2 surged around 4,000 years ago with agricultural intensification but subsequently declined in modern European populations while persisting at high levels in African and some American groups, a geographic divide mirroring socioeconomic inequities. Species-level analyses demonstrate widespread directional changes, with obligate anaerobes declining as aerotolerant taxa expand, reflecting a carbohydrate-associated functional remodeling toward starch metabolism. Phylogenomic reconstruction reveals contrasting evolutionary trajectories. Pauljensenia mediterranea experienced near-extinction following a severe bottleneck, while Actinomyces israelii underwent a selective sweep with rapid population expansion 1,000 years ago.

Antibiotic tolerance, the ability of bacteria to survive exposure to bactericidal concentrations of antibiotics without genetic resistance mutations, contributes to the need for prolonged treatment. Adjunctive targeting of antibiotic tolerance mechanisms could promote accelerated clearance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), thereby improving medical adherence. Our previous forward genetic screen for rifampin tolerance genes identified pstA1, which is involved in phosphate-specific import. The ABC-type transporter permease PstA1 has previously been implicated in Mtb virulence, as mutants lacking this gene exhibit defective survival during phosphate limitation in vitro, in infected macrophages, and in immunocompetent mice. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of rifampin was not altered in a pstA1 deletion mutant ({Delta}pstA1), suggesting this difference in susceptibility is not due to antibiotic resistance. Consistent with a role in rifampin tolerance, time-kill assays revealed a shift in the mean duration of killing (2-log reduction) from 1.6 days in wild-type to 1.0 day in {triangleup}pstA1, and complementation partially restored this phenotype. We found that pstA1 is specifically required for Mtb survival in the absence of exogenous inorganic phosphate and is important for adaptation to growth in culture without detergent, and within macrophages in an interferon-{gamma}-dependent manner. Differential expression analysis revealed that {Delta}pstA1 exhibited substantial transcriptional reprogramming with 58 differentially expressed genes (49 upregulated and 9 downregulated, adj.

Ganaxolone has been reported to act as a GABAA receptor agonist that helps reduce neuronal excitability; however, based on its chemical structure we hypothesized that ganaxolone may also act as a PTP1B inhibitor. We observed that ganaxalone was able to inhibit PTP1B activity both in an in vitro assay of enzyme activity and in different cell models, in a comparable way to known inhibitors of PTP1B, including MSI-1436, which has a similar chemical structure. Additionally, inhibition of PTP1B in differentiating SH-SY5Y cells increased TRKB/BDNF signaling. This effect was prominent in CDKL5-KO cells, where inhibition of PTP1B brought TRKB levels and BDNF signaling to levels similar to those of wild-type cells and the observed signaling changes also coincided with restoration of cellular morphology.
