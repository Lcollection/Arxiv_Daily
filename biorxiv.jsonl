M.; Lacroix, R.; Zaman, M.; Al Khatib, I.; Jaiswal, A.; Rho, J.; Kurrasch, D.; SHUTT, T.", "abstract": "The ketogenic diet (KD) is clinically beneficial and has therapeutic potential across a growing list of neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, the underlying mechanisms mediating the benefits of the KD, which can also have undesirable side effects, remain undefined. To this end, improvements in mitochondrial morphology and function correlate with improved ASD behaviours in response to the KD, though how the KD influences mitochondrial morphology, and whether this is sufficient to improve behaviour remains unknown. Here, we investigate how beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), a key metabolite produced by the KD regulates mitochondrial morphology, and whether this pathway could be exploited to alter phenotypes in a zebrafish model of ASD. We found that {beta}-oxidation of BHB promotes mitochondrial elongation by increasing NAD+ levels, which in turn activates SIRT deacetylases that act on key regulators of both mitochondrial fusion and fission. Our data suggest that increasing NAD+ levels with its precursor, nicotinamide nucleotide (NMN), is sufficient to promote mitochondrial hyperfusion. Finally, both BHB and NMN impact neurodevelopment in the shank3b+/- zebrafish model of ASD. Together, our findings elucidate a mechanism by which the ketogenic diet promotes mitochondrial elongation. Moreover, manipulation of this pathway may provide a novel avenue for the treatment of neurological disorders such as ASD that also may obviate potential complications of the KD in clinical practice.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Understanding how plant genetic variation influences reflectance spectra will help harness this potential for biodiversity monitoring and improve understanding of why plants differ in functional responses to environmental change. Here, we use a well-resolved genetic mapping population derived from Multi-parent Advanced Generation Inter-cross (MAGIC) lines of Nicotiana attenuata to associate genetic differences with differences in leaf spectra between plants in a field experiment in their natural environment. We analyzed the leaf reflectance spectra using a hand-held spectroradiometer (350-2500 nm) on 616 fully genotyped plants of N. attenuata grown in a randomized block design. We tested three approaches to conducting Genome-Wide Association Studies on spectral variants. We introduce a new Hierarchical Spectral Clustering with Parallel Analysis (HSC-PA) method. This method efficiently captured the variation in our high-dimensional dataset and allowed us to discover a novel association, between a locus on chromosome 1 and the 734-1143 nm spectral range, spanning the red-edge and near-infrared regions that are sensitive to leaf structure and photosynthetic activity. This locus contains a candidate gene annotated as carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme involved in CO2; hydration and regulation of photosynthetic efficiency, suggesting a physiological link between variation in leaf optical properties and carbon assimilation. In contrast, an approach treating single wavelengths as phenotypes identified the same associations as HSC-PA, but without the statistical power to pinpoint significant associations. An index-based approach, which reduces complex spectra to a few dimensionless variables, detected two significant associations for ARDSI_Cw (a water-content-related index) with loci on chromosome 1 near genes annotated as a Zeta toxin domain-containing protein, and an Exocyst subunit Exo70 family protein. While these findings are biologically plausible, they represent a very narrow subset of the spectral variation captured by HSC-PA. The HSC-PA approach supports a comprehensive understanding of the genetic determinants of leaf spectral variation which is data-driven but human-interpretable, and lays a robust foundation for future research in linking plant genetics with biodiversity monitoring, large-scale ecological assessment and remote-sensing applications.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

H.; Nastiuk, K. L.; Krolewski, J. J.", "abstract": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is an effective but not curative treatment for advanced and recurrent prostate cancer (PC). We investigated the mechanisms controlling the response to androgen-deprivation by surgical castration in genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of PC, using high frequency ultrasound imaging to rigorously measure tumor volume. Castration initially causes almost all tumors to shrink in volume, but many tumors subsequently recur within 5-10 weeks. Blockade of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling a few days in advance of castration surgery, using a TNFR2 ligand trap, prevents regression in a PTEN-deficient GEMM. Following tumor regression, a stem cell-like population within the tumor increases along with TNF protein levels. Tumor cell lines in culture recapitulate these in vivo observations, suggesting the possibility that stem cells are the source of TNF. When TNF signaling blockade is administered immediately prior to castration, tumors regress but recurrence is prevented. This implies that a late wave of TNF secretion within the tumor - which coincides with the expression of NFkappaB regulated genes - drives recurrence. The inhibition of signaling downstream of an NFkappaB-regulated protein - chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) - prevents post-castration tumor recurrence, phenocopying post-castration (late) TNF signaling blockade. CCL2 was originally identified as a macrophage chemoattractant and indeed at late times after castration gene sets related to chemotaxis and migration are up-regulated. Importantly, enhanced CCL2 signaling during the tumor recurrence phase coincides with an increase in pro-tumorigenic macrophages and a decrease in CD8 T cells, suggesting that recurrence is driven at least in part by tumor immunosuppression. In summary, we demonstrate that a therapy-induced switch in TNF signaling induces an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and concomitant tumor recurrence.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Using reinforcement learning-driven molecular dynamics simulations and constant pH MD, we investigate how clinically observed mutations in the {Omega}-loop (at amino acids V211, G214, E219, and Y221) alter the structure and function of PDC-3. Our findings reveal that these substitutions modulate the dynamic flexibility of the {Omega}-loop and the R2-loop, reshaping the cavity of the active site. In particular, E219K and Y221A disrupt the tridentate hydrogen bond network around K67, thus lowering its pKa and promoting proton transfer to the catalytic residue S64. Markov state models reveal that E219K achieves enhanced catalysis by adopting stable, long-lived 'active' conformations, whereas Y221A facilitates activity by rapidly toggling between bond-formed and bond-broken states. In addition, substitutions influence key hydrogen bonds that control the opening and closure of the active-site pocket, consequently influencing the overall size. The pocket expands in all nine clinically identified variants, creating additional space to accommodate bulkier R1 and R2 cephalosporin side chains. Taken together, these results provide a mechanistic basis for how single residue substitutions in the {Omega}-loop affect catalytic activity. Insights into the structural dynamics of the catalytic site advance our understanding of emerging {beta}-lactamase variants and can inform the rational design of novel inhibitors to combat drug-resistant P. aeruginosa.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Using genetic approaches and lipid reconstitution assays, we show that these ether lipid-regulated biophysical properties permit non-clathrin-mediated iron endocytosis via CD44, resulting in significant increases in intracellular redox-active iron and enhanced ferroptosis susceptibility. Using a combination of in vitro three-dimensional microvascular network systems and in vivo animal models, we show that loss of ether lipids from plasma membranes also strongly attenuates extravasation, metastatic burden and cancer stemness.

We find that implicit learning unfolds at a higher rate than conventionally expected in all feedback conditions. Increasing rotation size not only raises asymptotes, but also generally heightens explicit awareness, with no discernible difference in implicit rates. Cursor-jump and terminal feedback, with or without delays, predominantly enhance explicit adaptation while slightly diminishing the extent or the speed of implicit adaptation. In a continuous aiming reports condition, there is no discernible impact on implicit adaptation, and implicit and explicit adaptation progress at indistinguishable speeds. Finally, investigating the assumed negative correlation as an indicator of additivity of implicit and explicit processes, we observe weak associations at best across conditions.

Here we have comprehensively analyzed mice with deletion of Usp8 at different stages of B-cell development. Furthermore, we evaluated the function of USP8 in proteasome inhibition susceptible and Bortezomib (BTZ) resistant patient derived MM cells using depletion of USP8 and treatment with DUB-IN-2, a widely used inhibitor published to target USP8. Usp8 depletion in Usp8f/fCd19-Cre mice affected B-cell survival and development favoring immature, innate-like B cells, and germinal center and plasma cells, while also elevating immune-responses and causing Roquin depletion.

More recent findings suggest female song is widespread, raising questions about how social functions of birdsong shape song evolution. Certain breeding systems, like cooperative breeding, change social dynamics and selection pressures on both sexes, providing important contexts for studying song evolution. Here, we use phylogenetic comparative analyses across 1041 songbird species to examine relationships between cooperative breeding, female song, and male song characteristics. Here, we show robust bidirectional co-evolutionary dynamics between cooperative breeding and female song that persist when controlling for territoriality, allometry, and geographic sampling biases. Importantly, when examining intensity of territorial defense, we find this relationship is context-dependent: while cooperative breeding and female song commonly co-occur in strongly territorial systems, their association is especially pronounced in weakly territorial systems, where they co-occur much more often than expected by chance. Additionally, we observe that male song repertoire size evolves more slowly in cooperative-breeding lineages. These findings demonstrate that cooperative breeding shapes the evolution of vocal communication differently based on territorial context and sex, with female song potentially serving crucial but understudied functions related to social cohesion in cooperative systems, particularly in species where territorial conflict is reduced.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we report structures of coupled transcription-translation complexes having mRNA spacers between RNAP and ribosome longer than the maximum-length mRNA spacer compatible with formation of TTC B. The results define a new class of coupled transcription-translation complex, termed \"TTC-LC,\" where \"LC\" denotes \"long-range coupling.\" TTC-LC differs from TTC-B by a ~60{degrees} rotation and ~70 [A] translation of RNAP relative to ribosome, resulting in loss of direct interactions between RNAP and ribosome and creation of a ~70 [A] gap between RNAP and ribosome. TTC-LC accommodates long mRNA spacers by looping out mRNA from the gap between RNAP and ribosome. We present evidence that TTC-LC is an intermediate in assembling and disassembling TTC-B, mediating pre-TTC-B transcription-translation coupling before a ribosome catches up to RNAP, and mediating post-TTC-B transcription-translation coupling after a ribosome stops moving and RNAP continues moving.

Fifty-six male (n=32) and female (n=24) adult mice were housed in groups of 4 for one week with continuous access to food, water, two doses of ethanol (5% and 10%) and two doses of fentanyl (5 ug/ml and 20 ug/ml).

COI amplicon data for 573 mosquitoes collected from five regions of Greenland over 15 years enabled the identification of two species, O. nigripes and O. impiger, revealing an overlap in their distributions and limited within-species genetic structure. Quantitative 16S-V4 rRNA amplicon sequencing showed low bacterial densities compared to other insect species, alongside highly variable microbiota composed of environmentally versatile genera, including Janthinobacterium, Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Escherichia-Shigella. Interestingly, several mosquitoes yielded DNA reads of local vertebrates (likely from blood meals), along with putative vertebrate pathogens such as Bartonella. Fungal communities were low in density and variable in composition, with much of the diversity comprising putative phytopathogens. In contrast, Cladosporium was consistently detected across mosquitoes and controls, indicating likely contamination.

We examined their responses relative to local oddballs (LO) that we habituated into highly predictable priors. Four surprising findings in this dataset challenge many existing predictive processing models. First, passively evoked GO responses were exclusive to higher-order, more cognitive areas rather than early-to-mid sensory cortex.

To accomplish this, Suv39/Clr4 and HP1/Swi6 have to associate with nucleosomes both nonspecifically, binding DNA and octamer surfaces and specifically, via recognition of methylated H3K9 by their respective chromodomains. However, how both proteins avoid competition for the same nucleosomes in this process is unclear. Here, we show that phosphorylation tunes oligomerization and the nucleosome affinity of HP1/Swi6 such that it preferentially partitions onto Suv39/Clr4's trimethyl product rather than its unmethylated substrates. Preferential partitioning enables efficient conversion from di-to trimethylation on nucleosomes in vitro and H3K9me3 spreading in vivo. Together, our data suggests that phosphorylation of HP1/Swi6 creates a regime that increases oligomerization and relieves competition with the \"read-write\" mechanism of Suv39/Clr4, together promoting for productive heterochromatin spreading.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

However, the vast and mostly uncatalogued immunogenomic diversity of typical species adds complexity to the interpretation of experiments and hinders reproducibility. Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCM) offer a unique opportunity to circumvent these difficulties, due to their restricted genetic diversity. Results: We assembled high-quality immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) haplotypes from long-read genomic sequencing of 13 MCM. Four animals were homozygous for IGH, yielding 3 distinct haplotypes, termed H1, H2, and H3. IGH haplotype H1 was observed in two of the homozygotes and 5 additional heterozygous animals, accounting for half of the assemblies recovered. H1 shares only 83% average sequence identity with the IGH locus of the rhesus macaque reference genome, in addition to numerous large structural variations. The other two homozygous haplotypes exhibited considerable variation, including a 60 kilobase (Kbp) deletion and 200 Kbp insertion relative to H1. Furthermore, we annotated the IG gene content from all complete MCM IGH assemblies and found 288 functional IGHV alleles, of which 94 (33%) were not in existing databases. We also identified 68 functional IGHD alleles, 11 functional IGHJ alleles, and 33 functional constant gene alleles across all 5 isotypes. Conclusions: We identified multiple common and genetically diverse IGH haplotypes within MCM and provide high-quality reference assemblies and annotations for these to facilitate future work with this important animal model.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "During locomotion, the coordinated activity of dozens of muscles shapes the kinematic features of each stride, including systematic changes in limb movement across walking speed. Motor units, each of which consists of a single motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates, contribute to the total activation of each muscle through their recruitment and firing rate when active. However, it remains unknown how the nervous system controls locomotor speed by changing the firing of individual motor units. To address this, we combined quantitative behavioral analysis of mouse locomotion with single motor unit recordings from the lateral and long heads of the triceps brachii, which drive monoarticular extension of the elbow and biarticular movements of the elbow and shoulder, respectively. In contrast to prior studies employing bulk EMG to examine muscle activity, our recordings revealed the diversity of spike patterning across motor units as well as systematic differences in motor unit activity across muscles and locomotor speeds. First, motor unit activity differed significantly across the lateral and long heads, suggesting differential control of these two closely apposed elbow extensor muscles. Second, we found that individual units were recruited probabilistically (during only a subset of strides), showing that the highly repeatable bulk EMG signals observed across strides in fact reflect stochastically varying subsets of individual motor units. Finally, although recruitment probability and firing rate both increased at faster walking speeds, increases in recruitment were proportionally larger than rate changes, and recruitment of individual units accompanied changes in limb kinematics. Together, these results reveal how the firing of individual motor units varies systematically across muscles and walking speeds to produce flexible locomotor behavior.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Predictive processing theories propose that the brain supervises itself, to build an internal model of its environment. This internal model emerges by minimizing the prediction error, the discrepancy between internally generated predictions and external sensory signals. Empirically, this internal model is implemented with neurobiology and generates neurodynamics, especially oscillatory rhythms. In current approaches, there exists a trade-off between algorithmic and implementational aspects. One group of predictive processing models perform self-supervised computations but miss neurobiologic details and oscillatory neurodynamics. In the other group, biophysical models implement neural network models with maximal brain-like structure and oscillatory dynamics but require manual supervision. Here, we propose an evolutionary algorithm, the genetic stochastic delta rule (GSDR), to conduct simulations with biophysical neural networks. This approach enhances the explanatory power of theories in neurophysiology by exploring parameter spaces in a self-supervised fashion. We first evaluate GSDR in a simplified and minimal optimization problem. Then, we simulate commonly observed neural dynamics such as firing rate and modulation of neuronal oscillations. We show that GSDR is capable of replicating oscillatory dynamics observed through in-vivo electrophysiology, such that they emerge from synaptic plasticity. This methodology broadens the scope for biology-plausible, automated, large-scale and multi-objective simulations within computational neuroscience. With this virtuous cycle between data and models established by GSDR, we suggest that the search for the circuits underlying predictive processing can be grounded to neuronal data, improving the neurobiological basis of theories.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

To address this limitation, we developed Plexus, a self-supervised model specifically designed to capture and quantify network-level neuronal activity dynamics. Unlike existing phenotyping tools that focus on static readouts, Plexus leverages a network-level cell encoding method, which enables it to efficiently encode dynamic neuronal activity data into rich representational embeddings. In turn, Plexus achieves state of the art performance in detecting phenotypic changes in neuronal activity. We validated Plexus using a comprehensive GCaMP6m simulation framework and demonstrated its enhanced ability to classify distinct neuronal activity phenotypes compared to traditional signal-processing approaches. To enable practical application, we integrated Plexus with a scalable experimental system utilizing human iPSC-derived neurons equipped with the GCaMP6m calcium indicator and CRISPR interference machinery. This integrated platform successfully identified nearly seventeen times as many distinct phenotypic changes in response to genetic perturbations compared to conventional signal processing methods, as demonstrated in a 52-gene CRISPRi screen across multiple iPSC lines.

M.", "abstract": "Axolotls can regenerate lost limbs throughout their lives, while they continue to grow. This poses the question of how the size and pattern of a regenerating limb is matched to a widely varying animal size. Two interacting signaling molecules, SHH and FGF8, are produced at opposite sides of the regenerating limb and sustain tissue growth through a pair of oppositely-oriented signaling gradients. As the size of the regrowing tissue can vary more than three-fold depending on the size of the animal, it is unclear how the activities of these mutually dependent morphogens are maintained and subsequently terminated to determine appropriate growth. Scaling of limb regeneration suggests a size-dependent adaptation of morphogen gradient parameters. Inspired by this biological example, we theoretically investigate general mechanisms of morphogen-controlled growth arrest and proportional growth. In the proposed mechanism, tissue growth increases the spatial distance between the two morphogen gradients, thus providing negative feedback that eventually arrests morphogen activity and growth. We put forward two distinct scaling scenarios of morphogen gradients: either dynamic scaling with blastema size, where morphogen gradient parameters change dynamically with the growing tissue, or static scaling with animal size, where morphogen gradient parameters stay constant during blastema growth and only depend on animal size. We show that static scaling ensures proportional growth, but dynamic scaling does not. We compare theory predictions to experimental quantification of SHH and FGF8 morphogen gradient parameters at different time-points of regeneration in different-sized animals, indicating static scaling for some morphogen parameters, which is sufficient to ensure proportional growth in our model.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

This study examines the relationship between theta and alpha EEG activity and sequential fixations during relational memory retrieval. Participants completed a two-alternative forced-choice associative memory task while their eye movements and EEG were recorded simultaneously. Results reveal a relational eye-movement effect: correctly remembered target elements were disproportionately fixated during later stages of the retrieval sequence. Time-frequency EEG analyses across the test trial show that successful retrieval was characterized by an early, transient increase in theta power and a sustained decrease in alpha power. Gaze-related analyses linked these effects to distinct retrieval processes. The theta effect emerged after the initial cue fixation and predicted retrieval success independently of whether subsequent saccades were directed to the target or distractor. In contrast, the alpha decrease predicted retrieval success only across continued target fixations. These findings connect the relational eye-movement effect to two distinct neural signatures: a nonspecific theta increase, reflecting recollection that may initiate pattern completion, and a target-selective alpha decrease, reflecting sustained reactivation of goal-relevant associations across fixations. Together, these results clarify the temporal dynamics of relational memory retrieval and underscore the role of sequential eye movements in memory-guided behavior.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

By leveraging advanced signal processing and data analysis techniques, spike sorting makes it possible to detect, isolate, and map single neuron spiking activity from both in vivo and in vitro extracellular electrophysiological recordings. A crucial step of any spike sorting pipeline is to reduce the dimensionality of the recorded spike waveform data. Reducing the dimensionality of the processed data is a near-universal practice, fundamentally motivated by the use of clustering algorithms responsible to detect, isolate, and sort the recorded putative neurons. In this paper we propose and illustrate on both synthetic and experimental data that employing the nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) can drastically improve the performance, efficiency, robustness, and scalability of spike sorting pipelines without increasing their computational cost. We show how replacing the linear or ad hoc, expert-defined, supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods commonly used in spike sorting pipelines by the unsupervised, mathematically grounded, nonlinear dimensionality reduction method provided by UMAP drastically increases the number of correctly sorted neurons, makes the identification of quieter, seldom spiking neurons more reliable, enables deeper and more precise explorations and analysis of the neural code, and paves new ways toward more efficient and end-to-end automatable spike sorting pipelines of large-scale extracellular neural recording as those produced by high-density multielectrode arrays.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Recently, this prevailing view has been challenged by observation of choice correlated neural activity as early in the hierarchy as S1. Here, to reconcile these seemingly controversial observations, we employ ethological whisker-guided navigation of mice in a tactile virtual reality paradigm combined with dense electrophysiological recordings in whisker-related wS1. Leaving only a pair of C2 whiskers for mice to navigate with, we effectively designed an information bottleneck for sensory input to decision making. We show that neural activity during sensory evidence accumulation exhibits dramatic collapse of the high-dimensional spiking activity to just a single latent variable followed by a slower and almost synchronous ramping up across the whole cortical column. We show that this variable is consistent with models of gradual accumulation of noisy sensory evidence to a decision bound.

This species difference results from a specific extension of the early neurogenetic phase for DL neuron production before transitioning to the upper layer (UL) in rats, as confirmed by birthdating and single-cell transcriptomics. The duration of DL neuron production is regulated by a genetic program controlling progenitor aging, including canonical Wnt signaling. Comparative single-cell transcriptomics revealed that cortical progenitors in rats exhibit significantly elevated Wnt ligand expression.

We hypothesized that the core epileptogenic dynamics could be captured in a low-dimensional latent space derived from empirical data, without the need to record seizures. From interictal stereo-EEG (SEEG) recordings in 64 patients (29 females), we extracted 260 neuronal features and reduced them to 10 latent components using singular value decomposition. A classifier trained on these 10 components was then simplified into a probabilistic EpiNet model requiring only two components as input. Individual position in this two-dimensional latent space correlated with previously reported classification accuracy (r2=0.5), supporting its functional relevance. In three independent patients, the probabilistic model captured time-varying epileptogenic dynamics during sleep-SEEG recordings, corroborated clinical assessments, and achieved peak classification accuracies of 0.63, 0.85, and 0.94. These predictions were independently validated by tensor component analysis.

However, a challenge in ancient genomic analysis is the relatively low genome coverage for most samples, limiting analysis to pseudohaploid genotypes. Genotype imputation offers potential to alleviate this limitation by improving information content and accuracy in low coverage genomes. To test this we used published high coverage (>8x) goat palaeogenomes, imputing downsampled genomes using the VarGoats dataset (1,372 individuals) as a reference panel. Measuring concordance between imputed and high coverage genotypes, we find high concordance after filtering for common (>5%), high confidence variants, with 0.5x genomes reaching >0.97 concordance. There is a trade-off between coverage, genotype probability (GP) thresholds, and genotype recovery, where higher coverage and more lenient GP thresholds result in higher recovery, and a reduction in heterozygous false positive rates with stricter thresholds. We then imputed 36 goat palaeogenomes with [&ge;]0.5x coverage to examine runs-of-homozygosity (ROH) and identity-by-descent (IBD) patterns.

Evaluating genetic diversity in this context, before global change further alters Arctic ocean, is essential for understanding evolutionary dynamics during range expansion and for informing conservation strategies. Aulactinia stella is a circumpolar sea anemone with physiological characteristics in laboratory conditions suggesting a potential for clonal reproduction. In this study, we investigated its reproductive modes in natural populations across the Arctic ocean, from the northern Pacific to the Atlantic, and examined how genetic diversity is structured between adults and juveniles at five sampled sites. Across all study sites, we observed only females or individuals lacking gonads, with the exception of Kamchatka, where males were also present. Genetic indices and changes in genotype frequencies between adults and juveniles confirmed that this species reproduces partially by parthenogenesis. Populations on the Atlantic side were highly clonal with clonal rates (c) estimated at 80-99%, whereas populations on the Pacific side reproduced more sexually (c around 50%). Allelic diversity was twice as high in Kamchatka and Kuril populations, suggesting North Pacific coasts being the main last glacial refugia of A. stella. We found a stepping-stone pattern of genetic structure from Kamchatka to Atlantic populations, consistent with contemporary ocean currents and melted summer sea ice. Only a subset of the juvenile genetic diversity, mostly of local origin, was found in the established adults, while juveniles exhibited lower levels of genetic differentiation across the Arctic Ocean.

Here, we conduct large-scale pan-metagenomic and pan-metatranscriptomic analyses of the phyllosphere microbiome from 107 grapevine accessions spanning 34 Vitis species. We show that the grapevine core microbiome is dominated by phylum Bacillota and Pseudomonadota. Leveraging PacBio sequencing, we assembled 19 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the grapevine pan-microbiome, representing the first MAG reconstruction in plant-associated microbial communities using PacBio reads. These MAGs encode genes associated with antibiotic resistance, secondary metabolism, and carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), which could potentially influence grapevine biology. During downy mildew (DM) infection, DM-resistant grapevines exhibit significantly higher microbial network complexity than susceptible counterparts. Among the key taxa contributing to this complexity, Bacillota emerged as the dominant phylum with displaying strong abundance correlations with phylum Euglenozoa and Cyanobacteriota, and an isolated Bacillota species from the grapevine leaves, Bacillus cereus, demonstrated potent biocontrol activity against DM infection. Pan-metatranscriptomic analysis further revealed significant upregulation of eukaryotic microbial genes involved in primary and secondary metabolism. This pan-metagenomic study offers unprecedented insights into the complex structure, diversity and functional roles of grapevine phyllosphere microbiome, and presents valuable genomic and microbial resources for microbiome research and engineering to enhance viticulture productivity and quality.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have instead demonstrated assortative mating associated with cosmopolitan population structure, suggesting that social stratification may play a much stronger role in mate preferences. However, additional work in small-scale endogamous populations has been largely overlooked until now, even though this type of social structure characterized most of human evolution. Here, we evaluate HLA dissimilarity in one such group, Himba pastoralists from Namibia who have multiple relationship categories. Importantly, we compare partners who were in arranged marriages with those in chosen partnerships, i.e., \"love matches\" (n=249 observed partnerships). We find no difference in HLA dissimilarity (at the genotype and protein divergence level) between partnership types, nor in their fitness benefits to potential offspring as assessed via computationally predicted pathogen binding affinities. The effects of the partnership types likewise do not differ from a random, background distribution of 18,487 possible unrelated pairings. We do find extensive haplotype sharing at the HLA region, suggesting that episodes of fluctuating positive selection may be a more important driver of HLA polymorphism than disassortative mating.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Upon entering a mammalian host, it deploys a voluminous polysaccharide capsule that is necessary for it to survive host defenses and maintain an infection. Capsule expansion is regulated transcriptionally, as deletion of many transcription factors (TFs) alters capsule. Thus, we set out to map the transcriptional regulatory network of C. neoformans -- that is, to identify the TFs that directly regulate each gene in the genome. First, we carried out RNA-seq of 120 single-TF-deletion strains, together with wild-type controls. We then applied NetProphet3, a TF network mapping algorithm, to predict the direct functional targets of each TF. Unexpectedly, analysis of this network indicated that there are no TFs that primarily regulate genes involved in capsule formation. Rather, the TFs that play a role in deploying capsule also regulate many other genes and processes. Comparison to a TF network map we built for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a distantly related model yeast, identified pairs of TFs that are functionally orthologous -- that is, their targets are enriched for orthologous genes. In many cases, these pairs are different from the ones identified by sequence homology alone. We suggest that network analyses should be used to complement sequence comparison when searching for functionally orthologous transcription factors.

This raises the hitherto untested possibility that heterogeneity of the untransformed tumor stroma can actively fuel malignant progression. As biological heterogeneity is inherently difficult to control, we adopted a reductionist approach and let tumor cells invade micro-engineered environments harboring obstacles with precision-controlled geometry. We find that not only the presence of obstacles, but more surprisingly their spatial disorder, causes a drastic shift from a collective to a single-cell mode of invasion, comparable in strength to cadherin loss. Combining live-imaging and perturbation experiments with minimal biophysical modeling, we demonstrate that cell detachments result both from local geometrical constraints and a global integration of spatial disorder over time. We show that different types of micro-environments map onto different universality classes of invasion dynamics - homogeneous substrates follow Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling, while disordered ones exhibit exponents consistent with KPZ with quenched disorder (KPZq).

Notably, {gamma}H2AX mapping indicates its enrichment at transcription stress sites, while not all DSB-enriched genes show equal {gamma}H2AX marking, but those with DSBs tied to transcription stress are distinctly marked. Intriguingly, genes with high-DSBs marked by {gamma}H2AX exhibited significantly higher DSB turnover and repair than those with {gamma}H2AX-low genes, manifesting vulnerability to mutagenesis.

Here, we present PrinTE for versatile, forward-time simulation of whole-genome sequences with highly customizable transposon dynamics. Through simulations, we confirm that the distribution of TE sequence divergence reflects their historical insertion and deletion dynamics, which can be used to infer TE dynamic parameters through PrinTE simulations. We analyzed the pangenome of Pucciniomycotina, a subdivision of fungi containing myrtle rust (Austropuccinia psidii), which drastically expanded its genome size to 1018 Mb. Our analyses reveal that the best strategy for controlling genome size is to avoid the invasion of LTR retrotransposons (LTR-RTs). While illegitimate recombination (IR) is considered the most effective counteraction of LTR-RT invasions leaving only solo LTR remnants, we observed a strong positive correlation between solo:intact LTR ratio (strength of LTR-RT removal) and genome size (r = 0.65), and a near-linear correlation between solo LTR count and genome size (r = 0.98). This result suggests that IR alone may not effectively prevent genome obesity. Through simulation of Pucciniomycotina genomes, we proposed that A. psidii might experience a prolonged period of genome expansion followed by a short, potent, and likely ongoing period of contraction.

In this study, we propose a generative model for deriving epigenetic landscapes compatible with data. To build the landscapes, we combine gradient and rotational vector fields composed of locally weighted elements that encode `valleys' of the Waddington landscape, resulting in interpretable models. We optimize landscapes through computational evolution and illustrate our approach with two developmental examples: metazoan segmentation and neuromesoderm differentiation. In both cases, we obtain ensembles of solutions that reveal both known and novel landscapes in terms of topology and bifurcations.

Here, we propose a novel fingerprinting method based on homological scaffolds, a topological representation derived from persistent homology of resting-state fMRI data. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (n= 100), we show that scaffold-based fingerprints achieve near-perfect identification accuracy ([~] 100%), outperforming FC-based methods (90%), and remain robust across preprocessing pipelines, atlas choices, and even with drastically shortened scan durations. Unlike FC, in which fingerprinting features localize within networks, scaffolds derive their discriminative power from inter-network connections, revealing the existence of individual mesoscale organizational signatures. Finally, we show that scaffolds act as bridges between redundancy and synergy, by balancing redundancy along high-FC border edges with high synergy across the topological voids that the cycles define.

Here we report that in fish, males exhibit stronger antiviral immune responses, which are driven by the male-biased gene Cyp17a2 rather than by hormones or sex chromosomes. First, we observed that male zebrafish exhibit enhanced antiviral resistance compared to females, and notably, zebrafish lack sex chromosomes. Through transcriptomic screening, we found that cyp17a2 was specifically highly expressed in male fish. Cyp17a2 knockout males were equivalent to wild-type males in terms of sex organs and androgen secretion, but the ability to upregulate IFN as well as antiviral resistance was greatly reduced. Then, Cyp17a2 is identified as a positive IFN regulator which located at endoplasmic reticulum, and specifically interacts with and enhances STING mediated antiviral responses. Mechanistically, Cyp17a2 stabiles STING expression by recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase bloodthirsty-related gene family member 32 (btr32), which facilitates K33-linked polyubiquitination. The capacity of IFN induction of Cyp17a2 was abolished when STING is knockdown. Meanwhile, Cyp17a2 also attenuates viral infection directly to strengthen the antiviral capacity as an antiviral protein, Cyp17a2 degrades the spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV) P protein by utilizing USP8 to reduce its K33-linked polyubiquitination. These findings reveal a sex-based regulatory mechanism in teleost antiviral immunity, broadening our understanding of sexual dimorphism in immune responses beyond the conventional roles of sex chromosomes and hormones.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Using ethological assays, visceral adipose tissue transcriptomics, and genome-resolved metagenomics, we found that predator-odor exposure significantly affected mouse behavior, gene expression, and gut microbiota. Predator odor-responsive bacteria were associated with the expression of genes involved in anti-microbial defense, and host behavioral responses were predicted by random forest models trained on gut-microbiota profiles.

Mutation of the RUN domain (RPIP8, UNC-14, and NESCA) cargo adaptor gene unc-14 dramatically impacts overall GABAergic neuron morphology and dendritic spines. Mutation of the nicotinic acetylcholine alpha subunit gene unc-63 causes a failure in AChR assembly in GABAergic neurons but does not significantly alter dendritic spine structure or abundance.

Exploring how canonical recurrent neural circuits in the brain realize dynamic inference is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Nearly all existing studies on dynamic inference focus on deterministic algorithms, whereas cortical circuits are intrinsically stochastic, with accumulating evidence suggesting that they employ stochastic Bayesian sampling algorithms. Nevertheless, nearly all circuit sampling studies focused on static inference with fixed posterior over time instead of dynamic inference, leaving a gap between circuit sampling and dynamic inference. To bridge this gap, we study the sampling-based dynamic inference in a canonical recurrent circuit model with excitatory (E) neurons and two types of inhibitory interneurons: parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) neurons. We find that the canonical circuit unifies Langevin and Hamiltonian sampling to infer either static or dynamic latent states with various moving speeds. Remarkably, switching sampling algorithms and adjusting model's internal latent moving speed can be realized by modulating the gain of SOM neurons without changing synaptic weights. Moreover, when the circuit employs Hamiltonian sampling, its sampling trajectories oscillate around the true latent moving state, resembling the decoded spatial trajectories from hippocampal theta sequences. Our work provides overarching connections between the canonical circuit with diverse interneurons and sampling-based dynamic inference, deepening our understanding of the circuit implementation of Bayesian sampling.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Using a grid search of 36 parameter combinations, we evaluated four agronomic traits with five metrics: Pearson's r, Area Under the Curve (AUC), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and Fleiss' &#954 for stability. Our findings show that a low learning rate combined with a high number of boosting rounds substantially improves prediction stability (ICC > 0.98) and selection stability (Fleiss' &#954 > 0.80), while reducing train-test performance gaps. This combination produced concurrent improvements for predictive accuracy (r) and ranking efficiency (NDCG), though optimal settings were trait-dependent. Conversely, classification accuracy (AUC) was poor and performed relatively better with higher learning rates, revealing a conflict in optimization hyperparameters. Despite moderate Pearson's r and poor AUC in this challenging cross-season, cross-environment prediction scenario, NDCG remained high (> 0.85), indicating strong ability to rank top-performing entries.

Within terrestrial ectotherms, heat tolerance generally corresponds weakly to current climates, which has led many to conclude that this trait is evolutionarily constrained2-4.

We examined heat tolerance in 95 species of wild bees that varied in nesting behaviour across the latitudinal extent of Australia. Species nest (ground, wooden cavities, or plant stems) micro-climate temperatures predicted heat tolerance evolution, where stem nesters evolved the highest heat tolerances, and ground nesters evolved the lowest heat tolerances due to their ability to evade extreme heat. A moderate level of phylogenetic inertia in heat tolerance was explained by patterns of related species sharing nesting behaviours. This indicated repeated adaptive evolution of similar heat tolerances, rather than strong evolutionary constraints on heat tolerance. Finally, incorporating nesting behaviour into assessments of climate change vulnerability changed the rank order of which species were most at risk. This underscores the need to understand what drives the evolution of heat tolerance across species to better identify the taxa most at risk to climate change.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we generated a spatiomolecular atlas of NAc cell types and spatial domains by integrating spatial transcriptomics and single-nucleus RNA sequencing data from postmortem NAc tissue from 10 neurotypical adult donors. We identified 20 transcriptionally unique cell populations and 8 spatial domains, including specialized D1 islands composed of distinct dopamine receptor 1 (DRD1) MSN subtypes, which were enriched for OPRM1. In contrast to a discrete core vs. shell division, we observed continuous spatial gradients of gene expression across MSN domains, suggesting a more complex organization of DRD1 and DRD2 MSNs. Cross-species comparisons demonstrated conservation of MSN subtypes and spatial features between human, rodent, and nonhuman primate NAc. Genetic enrichment analysis with stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression revealed specific spatial domains associated with risk for psychiatric and addiction-related traits.

Here, we test the hypothesis that AAV-hSNCA overexpression reduces the firing rate of specific neuronal sub-types in Area X using in vivo recordings in anesthetized finches. Five classes of neurons were differentiated in AAV-treated finches based on waveform width (narrow vs. wide) and firing rates (low vs. fast). Wide-waveform/low rate activity is a consistent feature of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), a dominant cell type in Area Xand in mammalian basal ganglia. Reduced firing rates and enhanced post-peak rebound were detected in the AAV-hSNCA group for putative MSN neurons compared to controls. No differences in firing rate nor waveform shape were detected for the narrow waveform neurons. Our findings provide the first characterization of early a-syn driven neural activity changes in vocal control neurocircuitry.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Hippocampal neurons are a consistently affected cell type in these disorders. To investigate the effects of epigenetic machinery (EM) disruption in a disease-relevant context, we established a murine hippocampal neurodifferentiation model enabling systemic knockout (KO) of multiple EM factors. We then interrogated each EM-KO using Oxford Nanopore DNA methylation (DNAm) sequencing and RNA sequencing. Disruption of Kmt2a and Dnmt1 produced strikingly convergent gene expression changes. However, while Dnmt1-KO induced extensive DNAm alterations, KO of Kmt2a had little effect on methylation. Loss of either EM factor led to premature neuronal differentiation, partially explaining the transcriptional convergence. The transcription factor GSX1 emerged as a potential regulatory node, with altered methylation and expression in Kmt2a-KO cells, and ~20% of its known targets were differentially expressed. Extending our methylation analysis to 46 EM genes, we found that loss of DNA methyltransferases caused the strongest DNAm changes, whereas other EM-KOs induced milder-to-no effects. Clustering of EM factors based on promoter DNAm revealed two EM subgroups enriched for interactions with the DNAm machinery. Allele-specific analysis identified a shared differentially methylated region (DMR) at Zic4 across the entire group of EM-KOs, and Zic4 overexpression appears to maintain the NPC state. Taken together, our results reveal both gene-specific and convergent effects across diverse EM KOs and provide new insight into the molecular etiology of the MDEMs.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

While behavior in sequential decision-making tasks often reflects a mixture of both, the neural basis of individual differences in their expression remains unclear. To investigate this, we conducted a large-scale fMRI study with 179 participants performing a variant of the two-step task. Using both cluster-defined subgroups and computational parameter estimates, we found that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex encodes model-based and model-free value signals differently depending on individual strategy use. Model-based value signals were strongly linked to the degree of model-based behavioral reliance, whereas model-free signals appeared regardless of model-free behavioral influence. Leveraging the large sample, we also addressed a longstanding debate about whether model-based knowledge is incorporated into reward prediction errors or if such signals are purely model-free. Surprisingly, ventral striatum prediction error activity was better explained by model-based computations, while a middle caudate error signal was more aligned with model-free learning. Moreover, individuals lacking both model-based behavior and model-based neural signals exhibited impaired state prediction errors, suggesting a difficulty in building or updating their internal model of the environment. These findings indicate that model-free signals are ubiquitous across individuals, even in those not behaviorally relying on model-free strategies, while model-based representations appear only in those individuals utilizing such a strategy at the behavioral level, the absence of which may depend in part on underlying difficulties in forming accurate model-based predictions.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Yet, the majority of sequences in metagenomic datasets lack close relatives in existing references, representing a vast viral \"dark matter\" whose biology and evolution remain largely unknown. The central task is threefold: 1) to determine whether a genome is viral or non-viral, 2) to correctly assign viral genomes to known lineages when possible, and, critically, 3) to recognize when no existing lineage applies and thereby identify candidates for entirely novel viral groups. Existing approaches, which depend on sequence homology or narrow markers, struggle to capture this uncharted viral space. Here we present DeepVirus, a hierarchical transformer-based framework that models viral genomes as structured sequences of protein-coding genes. By combining protein-level embeddings from a foundation model with genome-aware representations, DeepVirus not only achieves accurate classification across deep taxonomic hierarchies, but also extends beyond conventional classification to detect and organize candidate novel viral lineages through open-set recognition. Applied to large-scale metagenomic resources, DeepVirus uncovered extensive viral diversity, including previously uncharacterized RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), thereby expanding the known evolutionary space of RNA viruses.

A.", "abstract": "Overfishing has severely depleted marine populations worldwide, including within protected areas. Illegal and unreported fishing are major contributors to this decline. Large-bodied apex predators such as sharks are among the most affected, with overfishing causing dramatic species declines and ecosystem destabilization due to trophic downgrading. Key barriers to effective marine conservation and management include: Data deficiencies that hinder population benchmarks and impact assessments, limited surveillance, allowing illegal fisheries to disproportionately affect apex predators, and insufficient capacity in vulnerable nations to monitor and protect species within their waters. Our study addresses these challenges through a novel genomic framework that enables assessment of shark population diversity and health, while also improving fisheries traceability by detecting instances of illegal fishing across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. We present the Reefshark Genomescape, the first genome-wide reference database for Indo-Pacific reef sharks, an assessment of genetic diversity, structure, and connectivity of two key species across their Indo-Pacific range and geographic assignment of fished individuals using population-specific genetic signatures. We show that grey reef shark (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos) populations exhibit high genetic diversity, strong population structure, and elevated Fst values, with previously unknown connectivity between the central and western Indian Ocean and clear isolation of populations in the Andaman Sea. In contrast, silvertip sharks (Carcharhinus albimarginatus) display high connectivity, but show genomic signals of declining population health, supporting a reassessment of their IUCN status. Using supervised machine learning with Monte Carlo cross-validation, we assigned geographic origins to fished grey reef sharks with 96% accuracy. These findings provide critical insights into population structure, connectivity, and health of two ecologically important reef shark species, while establishing a robust method for assigning geographic origin. We anticipate this framework will support regional conservation assessments and targeted management. Moreover, by enabling the identification of fishing hotspots and detection of IUU fishing, it lays the groundwork for a broader traceability system in marine ecosystems.

J.; Abdalla, B. J.; Abramovitch, R. B.", "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) arrests its growth at acidic pH, when grown on specific single carbon sources, including propionate. To understand the basis of the propionate-driven growth arrest at acidic pH, we conducted a genetic selection for mutants enabling growth on propionate at pH 5.7. All the selected mutants had insertions in the two-component regulatory genes phoR or phoP. We hypothesized that growth arrest at acidic pH is caused by PhoPR diverting carbon from central carbon metabolism towards lipid anabolism and that when PhoPR is inactivated, growth is promoted through metabolizing propionate by the methyl citrate cycle (MCC) into pyruvate, a permissive carbon source for growth at acidic pH. Using chemical inhibition and mutants of the MCC pathway, we demonstrate that the enhanced growth is dependent on the MCC. Furthermore, stimulating lipid synthesis via the methylmalonyl-CoA pathway by adding vitamin B12 restricts growth in the phoPR mutant and, conversely, restricting lipid anabolism by inhibiting the triacylglycerol (TAG) synthase Tgs1 enhances growth of the phoPR mutant. Notably, CoA pools increased in the phoPR mutant grown on propionate, directly supporting our model. Given the role of CoA metabolism in pyrazinamide sensitivity, Mtb sensitivity to pyrazinamide was examined on propionate at acidic pH. Surprisingly, pyrazinamide treatment of WT Mtb suppresses growth arrest on propionate at acidic pH. In contrast, the phoPR mutant has enhanced sensitivity to pyrazinamide. Together, these findings support that propionate-driven growth arrest at acidic pH is caused by metabolic remodeling that is regulated by PhoPR and is associated with pyrazinamide sensitivity.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Recent findings indicate that calpain-2 could participate in neurogenesis regulation through the truncation of the transcription factor, Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 2 (MEIS2). The present study aimed to test the effects of calpain-2 inhibition/deletion on MEIS2 levels and neurogenesis in adult mice. Two-to-three month-old mice were injected with a selective calpain-2 inhibitor, NA-184, and sacrificed 24 h later. In addition, two-to-three month-old conditional calpain-2 knock-out (C2KO) and calpain-1 knock-out (C1KO) mice were used. Levels of MEIS2 and of cell markers for neurogenesis were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and western blots. Dendritic spines in hippocampal neurons were also analyzed by Golgi staining. Acute treatment of wild-type (WT) mice with NA-184 increased levels of MEIS2 in various brain structures. It also increased numbers of neurons immunopositive for Ki67 and DCX, two markers for neurogenesis, in both the SVZ and DG. MEIS2 levels were elevated in C2KO mouse brain, while they were decreased in C1KO mouse brain. Compared to those in WT mice, neurons from C2KO mice exhibited a decrease in the number of filipodia spines and an increase in the number of mushroom spines, while those from C1KO exhibited opposite changes. These findings further emphasize the critical and opposite roles of calpain-1 and calpain-2 in brain functions in general, and in neurogenesis in particular with MEIS2 as a major downstream mediator. These findings also underline previous conclusions that calpain-1 promotes spine maturation and synaptic plasticity while calpain-2 hinders spine maturation and synaptic plasticity. These results indicate that calpain-2 inhibition/deletion results in increased neurogenesis, as well as in increased maturation of dendritic spines, potentially due to increased levels and activation of MEIS2.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Reversal of PPI deficits is routinely tested in disease models as a preclinical trial for antipsychotic drug screening. However, the cellular and circuit-level mechanisms underlying PPI deficits remain unclear, limiting therapeutic progress.

While Prodh-/- mice showed aberrant CeA neuronal properties and reduced PPI levels, we re-stored PPI by photo-activating CeA-PnC glutamatergic synapses, underscoring their involvement in pathological states. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the amygdala-brainstem circuitry that underlies PPI deficits, offering new potential for therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

However, the behavioral mechanisms that support cooperation, and how their disruption leads to social deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), remain poorly understood. To address these questions, we developed a cooperation task in paired spatial mazes in dyads of wild-type (WT) and Fmr1 knockout (Fmr1) rats, a model of Fragile X syndrome, under deterministic (100%) and probabilistic (50%) reward contingencies. Both WT and Fmr1 rat pairs exhibited mixed leader-follower strategies to coordinate their actions for cooperation, however WT pairs achieved significantly greater cooperation success than Fmr1 pairs. WT and Fmr1 pairs both displayed a follower-tracking-leader strategy during transitions between reward wells, which required partner-directed visual attention, followed by a reactive action to match leader position, with Fmr1 pairs reliant on this strategy to a greater degree. In WT rats, more efficient cooperation was based on a flexible predictive strategy leading to coordination of optimal choice patterns between rat pairs and sensitivity to recent partner choices, whereas Fmr1 rats were significantly weaker in these strategies leading to deficits in adaptive behavior. These findings identify key behavioral strategies for cooperation, reveal their disruption in a rat model of ASD, and provide a framework for linking social cue usage to flexible and strategic cooperative decision-making with relevance to neurodevelopmental disorders.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

However, in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), impaired Treg function contributes to immune dysregulation and disease pathology. While most studies of human Tregs have focused on blood, here we analyzed Tregs in synovial tissues from RA patients using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We identified two predominant Treg states, CD25hiCXCR6pos Tregs with strong suppressive function, and CD25loAREGpos Tregs, a dysfunctional state exclusively enriched in synovial tissues but not in blood. Computational and in vitro analyses revealed that cortisol induced AREG expression, suppressed glycolysis, and impaired the suppressive function of CD25loAREGpos Tregs. In turn, AREG promoted an IL-33+ inflammatory phenotype in synovial fibroblasts. Importantly, we found that TNFR2 engagement can prevent or reverse this dysfunctional Treg state. In contrast to CD25loAREGpos Tregs, CD25hiCXCR6pos Tregs were highly suppressive, showed coordinated abundance with macrophages in synovial tissue, and functionally interacted with membrane-bound TNF expressed by macrophages, which promoted their functional suppressive state. These two Treg subsets were similarly found in the synovial tissue in Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA), another inflammatory arthritic disorder, indicating conserved mechanisms across arthritic diseases. Together, our findings define distinct pathways driving divergent functional and dysfunctional Treg states in inflamed tissues and point to interventions that may prevent or reverse the development of the dysfunctional state.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

While the gene regulatory networks guiding neural crest development are well characterized, the mechanisms generating species-specific craniofacial diversity remain poorly understood. Marsupials provide a unique model for studying neural crest plasticity, having evolved accelerated patterns of craniofacial development during embryogenesis. This adaptation arises in response to marsupials being born altricial after a short gestation yet require well-developed mouthparts to attach to a teat and continue development in the pouch. However, how marsupials achieve this heterochronic shift in neural crest development is largely unknown. In this study, we investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying their distinct heterochrony, revealing that marsupials produce dense pre-migratory aggregates of neural crest cells which undergo collective migration as epithelial-like sheets, potentially facilitating rapid establishment of the facial prominences. These cellular behaviours are unique amongst amniotes but resemble patterns in anamniotes which similarly exhibit accelerated craniofacial development to support early feeding. Marsupials appear to have evolved a similar mechanism of neural crest migration to facilitate their developmental heterochrony. These findings suggest that vertebrate neural crest migration may be shaped by the pace of craniofacial development during embryogenesis rather than phylogeny, providing new perspectives on neural crest plasticity and the developmental mechanisms driving craniofacial diversity across vertebrates.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Non-reference genomic insertions, such as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), are common in mammalian genomes and are potential drivers of genetic hitchhiking. In this study, we performed a population genomic scan of non-reference ERV insertions in wild house mice (Mus musculus). Using a newly developed bioinformatics pipeline, we identified and characterized >100,000 non-reference ERV insertions from short-read sequencing data across 163 wild house mouse genomes. Our analysis revealed substantial variation in ERV insertion patterns among wild house mice. Focusing on the Fv4, a known ERV-derived defense gene against murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) and mainly restricted in the range of M. m. castaneus, we detected evidence of adaptive introgression from M. m. castaneus to M. m. musculus, particularly in a part of northern East Asia. Selective sweep analysis in Korean M. m. musculus, where Fv4 is prevalent despite a predominantly musculus-like genetic background, indicated that the spread of Fv4 has been driven by recent positive selection presumably owing to the protection against MLVs. Additional genomic scans identified several other ERV insertions associated with high-frequency selective sweeps, suggesting that ERVs serve as cryptic drivers of adaptive evolution. Our findings highlight the role of ERV as genetic elements subject to selection, serving as potential contributors to host-pathogen interactions.

Despite substantial research efforts, major gaps remain in our understanding of this heterogeneity, particularly regarding its developmental underpinnings. Life history theory, a leading framework in evolutionary developmental biology, can help make sense of this heterogeneity. Methods: In a large nationally representative prospective survey (n = 34 653), the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), we used Multi-group MIMIC models to investigate whether and how the degree to which individuals trade off somatic maintenance against short-term reproductive goals relates to severity of BPD at a general and a single symptom level, and whether these associations differ between men and women in the general adult population. Results: Men and women prioritizing short-term reproductive goals over somatic maintenance were more likely to endorse each of the 9 DSM-IV BPD symptoms through higher BPD severity, and were more likely to express impulsivity (b=0.11; SE, 0.018; p<.001) and suicidal/self-mutilation behavior (b =0.24; SE, 0.026; p< .001) and less likely to endorse stress-related paranoid ideation (b=-0.066; SE, 0.023; p=.004). Finally, females with a reproduction-oriented life history strategy were more likely to endorse affective instability than males (Females: b=0.12; SE, 0.025; p<.001; Males: b=-0.015; SE, 0.044; p=0.73). Conclusions: An evolutionary-developmental framework, rooted in human life history theory can help make sense of the heterogeneous manifestations of BPD.

We present Spacelink, a unified framework that models spatial variability of a gene at both whole-tissue and cell-type resolution using an adaptive mixture of data-driven spatial kernels and summarizes it using an Effective Spatial Variability (ESV) metric. Spacelink achieved up to 3.2x higher detection power over eight existing global SVG and cell-type SVG methods while showing consistently superior FDR control across 34 different simulation settings and also showed superior cross-platform concordance in matched tissue Visium and CosMx datasets. Applied to 3 healthy CosMx human tissues (brain cortex, lymph node, liver), Spacelink revealed that SVGs are highly informative for 113 complex traits and diseases (average N = 340,406). Spacelink showed up to 2.2x higher disease informativeness over competing methods in tissue-relevant complex diseases and traits, conditional on putative non-spatial expression-level confounders. Applied to a mouse organogenesis Stereo-seq atlas (8 developmental stages), Spacelink identified 145 genes with stage-associated ESV within brain independent of mean expression, that are enriched in pathways like Wnt signaling and Rap1 signaling characterizing early and late development, respectively. Integration with in vivo Perturb-seq targeting 35 de novo ASD risk genes revealed that perturbations in excitatory neurons and astrocytes preferentially altered spatially structured downstream gene programs (1.7-2.2x higher average ESV across stages than other cell types), many of which were enriched for polygenic autism GWAS loci. In neurodegeneration, analysis of 32 Visium dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples spanning Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology stages identified 334 genes with decreasing ESV along amyloid burden (enriched for glycolysis) and 216 genes with decreasing ESV along tau tangle accumulation (enriched for apoptotic pathways). Several AD risk genes (PKM, CLU, GPI) showed conserved reductions in spatial variability with AD pathology in both human and 5xFAD mouse, with PKM linking to a colocalized splicing QTL and amyloid burden QTL variant.

This proportion declined to parity by migration onset, indicating developmental adjustment with increasing experience. During migration, side-biased circling was linked to wider turns taken, reduced altitude gain, and daily travel distances shortened by 13%. These findings reveal a direct trade-off between the neurological efficiency of lateralization and the aerodynamic requirements of efficient soaring. More broadly, they demonstrate that behavioural asymmetries can constrain, rather than always enhance, performance.

Here we investigate the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (NE) system in controlling the balance between speed and accuracy during decision making. Through cell-type specific chemogenetic manipulations, we discovered that LC-NE activation increased decision thresholds. We further demonstrated that this effect is replicated by systemic administration of the 2 adrenergic receptor (2 AR) agonist, clonidine. Notably, 2 AR activation drove changes in decision threshold specifically, without reproducing other LC-NE activation effects such as promoting task engagement.

Here, we demonstrate dynamic trafficking of amphisomes within the long-range, highly branched axons of locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) neurons. Using in vivo photoconversion, we show that amphisomes originating in distal axons can traverse the entire axonal length to reach the soma. Two-photon imaging of LC-NE projections to the prefrontal cortex revealed that velocity and directionality of trafficking are tightly regulated by LC activity states, behavioural context, and autocrine norepinephrine signalling. Activation of Gi-coupled receptor signalling unifies directionality of transport, enhances somatic cargo delivery, whereas prolonged distal immobilization correlates with increased norepinephrine release, consistent with a signalling function. Together, these findings establish LC amphisomes as dual-function organelles that integrate degradative transport with activity-dependent signalling in vivo.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Variation in analytical choices for isolating brain rhythms from background arrhythmic activity makes interpreting findings across studies difficult. Whether current approaches can accurately recover the independent contribution of these neural signal elements remains to be established. Here, using simulation and parameter recovery approaches, we show that standard analytic methods for quantifying rhythmic activity conflate these two neurophysiological components, yielding spurious correlations between spectral model parameters. We propose an alternative approach to overcome these limitations and demonstrate effective separation of rhythmic and arrhythmic components in simulated neural time series.

Pose estimation methods can produce accurate keypoints using framewise inference. However, post hoc tracking steps often struggle to maintain consistent identity over time, particularly during close and rapid social interactions between visually similar animals. We present a pipeline for bidirectional video object segmentation (VOS) to correct identity swaps with much less manual annotation effort, addressing the prohibitive cost of identity correction of pose estimation data in long recordings and large cohorts. Our approach makes use of a state-of-the-art VOS algorithm, Cutie, which leverages both pixel- and object-level representations across multiple memory timescales. By comparing segmentation masks from independent forward and reverse inference runs, we identify localized zones of disagreement and flag them for manual review. When applied to more than 160 hours of dyadic vole interaction videos, our method reduces identity swaps by two orders of magnitude compared to typical pose estimation workflows and requires review of less than 0.3% of frames per video to achieve identity error-free segmentation masks and aligned keypoints. Our approach generalizes to social interactions involving three or more animals, with scalability constrained primarily by behavioral complexity (e.g., complete occlusion of multiple individuals). Our method enables scalable, long-term tracking of unmarked animals in group settings and provides a practical foundation for more naturalistic studies of social behavior.

To interrogate these signatures, we established a CRISPR-compatible neutrophil differentiation platform from adult CD34. progenitors, which yielded cells closely resembling primary neutrophils at transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional levels. A targeted CRISPR-Cas9 screen revealed a central role for the mitochondrial iron transporter mitoferrin-1 (SLC25A37) in coordinating neutrophil oxidative phosphorylation, NET formation, and type I IFN production downstream of TLR9.

Disruption of this loop, through IFNAR1 depletion or blockade, dampened neutrophil-driven tissue damage in human intestinal and alveolar organoid co-cultures as well as in murine models of colitis and cigarette smoke-induced lung inflammation.

These DSBs occur in a cell cycle stage-dependent manner, predominantly in cells past the restriction point when quiescence is induced. Mechanistically, this DSB accumulation results from continued cell cycle activity under growth restriction conditions, accompanied by downregulation of DSB repair genes, allowing these breaks to persist during quiescence. Cells that accumulate more DSBs during quiescence induction enter a deeper state of quiescence, requiring stronger growth stimulation for cell cycle re-entry. Notably, cell cycle re-entry depends on DSB repair mediated by DNA-PK, an intrinsically error-prone process.

Their full potential often remains unrealised due to entrenched management practices, as best exemplified by high-intensity mowing, which has given rise to the most ubiquitous greenspaces feature worldwide: the turfgrass lawn. Lawns are notoriously deficient at supporting insect communities due to their simplified vegetation structure and low plant diversity, and the compounded effect of frequent mowing on forb growth, which limits their capacity to come into flower and supply floral resources to pollinators and other flower visitors. Addressing these shortcomings can be readily achieved by reducing mowing intensity, resulting in greater vegetation height, flower cover and plant diversity - effectively transforming lawns into a more complex grassland-type ecosystem. This approach is particularly enticing to practitioners pursuing positive, cost-effective biodiversity outcomes while upholding their commitment to core ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation projects. Here, we demonstrate how transitioning a lawn from high- to low-intensity mowing regimes led to pronounced increases in the number of indigenous insect species, evident both for the whole community and on assemblages of functionally similar species, including detritivores, herbivores, predators, parasitoids and pollinators. We further identify a positive effect of vegetation height on the community and species-specific probabilities of occurrence of indigenous species, which was consistently strong for detritivores, herbivores and parasitoids. We also show that the number of indigenous species associated with our low-intensity mowing treatment markedly exceeded that of 43 high-intensity mowed lawns previously surveyed throughout the study area, and that the effect of vegetation height across our field experiment gradient was substantially stronger than that of the existing high-intensity lawns gradient. Our findings provide compelling evidence that reducing lawn mowing intensity yields positive ecological outcomes for functionally diverse indigenous insect communities, charting a course for stakeholders tasked with demonstrating how evidence-based greening actions can be a sound investment to meet local, regional and global biodiversity targets.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Finally, using cell type specific models linking DNA sequence to chromatin accessibility we prioritize variants associated with impaired pulmonary function or disease and nominate mechanisms of motif disruption.

B.", "abstract": "DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) is a de novo DNA methyltransferase that is recurrently mutated in hematological malignancies and developmental disorders. The most prevalent mutation, R882H, compromises DNMT3A activity in a dominant-negative manner, but its precise biochemical mechanism has been debated. Here, we use paired deep mutational scanning of the wild-type and R882H-mutant proteins to systematically identify mutations on a massively parallel scale that modify DNMT3A activity by suppressing, phenocopying, or selectively rescuing the dominant-negative effect of R882H. By leveraging the mutational depth and unbiased nature of the paired genetic landscapes, we uncover two distinct mechanisms that can rescue DNMT3AR882H activity, providing novel insights into the function of the R882 hotspot. First, by analyzing the effects of combinatorial mutations in the target recognition domain (TRD), we reveal that its crosstalk with the ADD regulatory domain modulates DNMT3A DNA binding and enzymatic activity, partially compensating for R882H-induced loss-of-function. Second, pairwise analysis of variant effects across the two genetic backgrounds supports the notion that R882H promotes aberrant macro-oligomerization of DNMT3A via its central dimerization interface, which accounts for its dominant-negative effect. Critically, we show that the R882 position exhibits a distinct dominant-negative signature in the genetic landscape, where positively charged residues at this position safeguard against aberrant macro-oligomerization. By performing hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) on DNMT3A mutants, we show that R882H dramatically alters the protein dynamics of DNMT3A, rigidifying its central dimerization interface to promote oligomerization. Our data support a new model in which R882H removes the critical function of R882, where the arginine attenuates the pre-organization of the interface and subsequent oligomerization at a supramolecular assembly hotspot1. Altogether, we map the genetic landscape underpinning the DNMT3AR882H hotspot mutation, illuminating the unexpected molecular mechanism of macro-oligomerization that drives its dominant-negative effect.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

This suggests that memory is modulated by neural networks containing clock neurons, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In Drosophila melanogaster, approximately 240 clock neurons are grouped into at least eight distinct clusters. Among them, the dorsal--lateral neurons (LNds) are required for maintaining long-term memory (LTM). In contrast, the neuropeptide Pigment-dispersing factor (Pdf), expressed in both small and large ventral--lateral neurons (s-LNvs and l-LNvs, respectively), functions as a circadian output signal and is also essential for maintaining LTM. In addition, Pdf-expressing neurons (hereafter, Pdf neurons) release neurotransmitters other than Pdf, which are involved in LTM consolidation. However, the specific transmitters used by LNds and Pdf neurons in LTM processing have remained unknown. Here, we show that octopamine signaling from LNds is essential for LTM maintenance, whereas octopamine in Pdf neurons is essential for LTM consolidation. Temporally restricted knockdown of Tyramine {beta} hydroxylase (Tbh), the gene encoding the enzyme required for octopamine synthesis, disrupted LTM maintenance when targeted in LNds, whereas it impaired LTM consolidation when targeted in Pdf neurons. Notably, Tbh knockdown in LNds or Pdf neurons had minimal effects on circadian behavioral rhythms or sleep. These findings reveal that octopamine released from specific subtypes of clock neurons independently regulates distinct phases of LTM in Drosophila.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Generation of IEC-specific Nos2 knockout mice revealed that epithelial Nos2 activity promoted susceptibility to intestinal disease and sustained a colitogenic microbiota. Epithelial Nos2 increased levels of nitric oxide-derived nitrates and nitrate-metabolizing bacteria in the intestine. Unexpectedly, extra-intestinal nitrates also reflected IEC-intrinsic Nos2 expression, and systemic nitrate concentrations in patients paralleled intestinal Nos2 activation. In fact, temporally inhibiting epithelial Nos2 was sufficient to alter intestinal nitrate homeostasis and inflammation in mice, as well as restrict nitrate production by human intestinal organoids.

Here, we identify the hemi-arrestin protein Sms1 as a structurally novel scaffold of this MAPK cascade. Interactions with PIP2 and the pheromone receptor-coupled G subunit target Sms1 to plasma membrane patches, where it assembles the active cascade by binding each MAP kinase. These interactions are essential for signal transduction and local signal interpretation for polarised growth. Phosphorylation, including by the MAPK itself, antagonises Sms1 membrane translocation, establishing a negative feedback that underlies polarity patch turnover and prevents untimely mating attempts. Thus, Sms1 is a MAPK scaffold with canonical functions despite its distinct structural fold, highlighting convergent evolution of MAPK scaffolds across eukaryotes.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Variants of all system components are available, and we here test three degrons, three auxins and three degron receptors to identify optimal combinations of these variants in budding yeast.

To elucidate them, we established mNeonGreen-Tgl3 and Pln1-mNeonGreen as protein markers for lipid droplets (LDs) and determined LD dynamics during the cell cycle with single-cell time-lapse microscopy. We found oscillations in the LD number over the cell cycle, with a notable trough around START. Deletion of the genes responsible for either the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG) or its mobilisation from LDs lowered LD numbers and abolished the oscillation in LD number. Moreover, in these deletion mutants, we found START to be delayed, suggesting that the mobilisation of TAG from LDs is required for its timely occurrence.

The proper intracellular trafficking of the photopigment receptor rhodopsin (Rho) is essential for normal rod homeostasis, as Rho mislocalization precedes rod cell death in inherited retinal disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa. Despite its importance, the molecular mechanisms of Rho trafficking in mammalian rods remain largely undefined. In this study, we combined multiple Rho-labeling strategies with super-resolution microscopy to investigate the subcellular organization of Rho in the Golgi complex of mammalian rods. Using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM) super-resolution imaging modalities, we mapped the localization of Golgi proteins with Rho in mouse and macaque rods and found that Rho specifically colocalizes with Rab6a in the trans-Golgi. To test the functional significance of this interaction, we utilized a dominant-negative Rab6a mutant in both HEK293T cells and mouse rods. We demonstrated that the dominant negative Rab6a significantly inhibits Rho secretion in cell culture, causing intracellular retention. In mouse rods, we found that this mutant similarly causes significant Rho retention in the trans-Golgi. However, surprisingly, a majority of Rho protein still escaped the Golgi and reached the outer segment. Together, these findings uncover critical new subcellular details about Rho organization at the Golgi and establish a role for Rab6a as a regulator of Rho protein release from the trans-Golgi in mammalian rods.

Interactions between these stressors may affect tipping points. Also, the accumulation of stress over time (degree day) could condition the reaching of tipping points. Yet, these aspects have never been studied. Here, we hypothesise that SSF reduces the thermal tipping point of Calanus spp., key copepods that play a structuring role in marine food webs. Calanus spp. from the Oslofjord were exposed to a temperature gradient from 8 to 20 degrees C and a salinity range from 35 to 10 PSU. We found that the survival of Calanus spp. tipped and decreased above temperatures of 14 - 18 degrees C, which are already reached in the surface waters of the Oslofjord during summer months. At 29 PSU, this corresponded to a tipping point of heat accumulation of 28 degrees C.d above which survival decreased. Reduced salinity below 29 PSU, prevalent year-round in surface waters, suppressed this tipping point, inducing linear decreases in survival when temperature rises above 8 degrees C. Thus, the thermal niche of Calanus spp. will decrease with SSF, impacting whole ecosystems. We provide the first statistical determination of heat accumulation tipping points. We also demonstrate that exposure to a secondary stressor can suppress tipping points to a primary stressor, thereby removing the ability of phenotypic plasticity to buffer negative impacts on fitness.

Mirror-image flowers represent a form of reciprocal herkogamy in which plants have either right- or left-deflected styles (dimorphic enantiostyly) or produce both stylar orientations (monomorphic enantiostyly). The ecological conditions under which these two forms of enantiostyly originate and persist remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate how floral asymmetry affects pollen transfer dynamics and mating outcomes, and under which conditions enantiostyly provides a fitness advantage over straight-styled floral morphologies. We integrate field observations of dimorphic enantiostylous Wachendorfia paniculata with a mathematical model simulating pollen transfer in plants with straight-styled, monomorphic, and dimorphic enantiostylous flowers. The model incorporates pollinator pathways, pollen carryover, and floral display size, and was parameterized using our ecological data. Enantiostylous flowers received more outcrossed pollen than straight-styled flowers, with dimorphism outperforming monomorphism. However, enantiostyly increased stochasticity in pollen transfer due to variation in pollinator pathways. Intrafloral self-pollination was extremely low in enantiostylous flowers and did not differ between monomorphic and dimorphic forms. Dimorphic enantiostylous plants exhibited longer pollen carryover curves and exported more pollen to more mates potentially increasing siring success and mate diversity. Enantiostyly, particularly in dimorphic systems, can provide a selective advantage by improving pollen receipt and export components of fitness through enhanced outcrossing. This mating advantage may be reduced under conditions of pollen limitation or when autogamy in straight-styled flowers is low.

We have previously shown that the TNF superfamily factor TWEAK (TNFSF12) can induce a UC-like inflammatory profile in colonic fibroblasts in vitro, in turn promoting monocyte adhesion and activation. However, the mechanisms underlying fibroblast-monocyte communication and its dysregulation in colitis are incompletely understood. Methods Here we use co-culture models, human biopsies from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and healthy donors, and public single-cell transcriptomics to characterise the mechanisms underlying fibroblast-mediated monocyte activation. Results We show that TWEAK-treated inflammatory fibroblasts induce a transcriptional programme that resembles early monocyte/macrophage intermediates in UC and is enriched for genes associated with resistance to anti-TNF (TREM1, OSM, IL1B) and susceptibility to IBD (NOD2, ATG16L1). We find that conditioned media from TWEAK-treated fibroblast causes a sustained activation of STAT3 phosphorylation in monocytes, and that inhibition of the NF-{kappa}B Inducing Kinase (NIK) impairs the ability of inflammatory fibroblasts to activate STAT3 phosphorylation in monocytes, resulting in reduced expression of inflammatory mediators. Using tissues from UC patients, we show that the expansion of CD90+/PDPN+ inflammatory fibroblasts in UC correlates with the accumulation of TWEAK+ myeloid cells in the colonic mucosa, and that these fibroblasts co-localise with infiltrating monocytes in sites of active inflammation.

Materials and Methods: A total of 12 newly diagnosed treatment naive pediatric B-ALL cases from a local tertiary care hospital were enrolled in this study. Following the nucleic acids isolation procedures, the RNA sequencing was done for 12 B-ALL patients to find the fusion genes.

We curate high confidence structural annotations for the M. tuberculosis proteome from 1,371 crystallography and 2,316 AlphaFold predictions, and combine the structures with mutations from over 31,000 clinical M. tuberculosis isolates. We demonstrate that mutations in proteins known to cause resistance are clustered in 3D space, even in proteins where inactivating mutations at any position are thought to cause resistance. We develop a statistic to search the M. tuberculosis proteome for signal of clustered non-synonymous mutations, finding over 450 proteins that display this signal, many of which have a known relationship with antibiotic resistance. Innovatively, we show that a supervised classifier trained on structure features alone has an F1 score of 94.6% at classifying mutations as resistance-conferring. This work demonstrates that protein structure provides useful information for categorizing which variants may cause antibiotic resistance, even when the majority of structures are AI-predicted.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

A.; Foo, R.; Hussin, J.", "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with a specific traits and diseases, however, uncovering the true disease-relevant SNPs remains challenging. One limitation for prioritizing true disease-relevant SNPs from GWAS is that most of the identified SNPs are non-coding, making it difficult to unravel their mechanism of action. Nevertheless, mapping non-coding SNPs to enhancers is a validated approach to link SNPs to their target genes through the analysis of enhancer-gene interactions (EGI) and thus provide insight into their mechanism of action. While previous studies linking cardiac disease-relevant SNPs to enhancers and their target genes have focused on the principal cardiac cell type, cardiomyocytes (CMs), the analysis of other non-CM cell types has been largely ignored and has only gained attention recently. We hypothesize that characterizing cell-type-specific enhancer-gene interactions (EGIs) for these non-CMs, namely cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), endothelial cells (ECs), and smooth muscle cells (SMCs), followed by mapping cardiac-disease-associated non-coding SNPs to those enhancers will identify novel disease-relevant genes and provide insights for future mechanistic research. To identify the landscape of cell-type-specific EGIs in these cardiac cells, we have employed the activity-by-Contact (ABC) model. It integrates assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq), H3K27ac chromatin immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq), and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture with H3K27ac immunoprecipitation (H3K27ac HiChIP) data to identify EGIs. We have identified the landscape of cell-type-specific EGIs in these cardiac cells. Furthermore, a higher similarity of the chromatin accessibility profile (ATAC-seq) between CF and SMC, compared to CF and EC, and SMC and EC was observed. Finally, overlapping identified EGIs with cardiac-disease-associated non-coding variants has allowed the identification of a QT-interval associated SNP that is mapped to the enhancer region of an EC-specific EGI.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

While electronic resonance significantly enhances sensitivity, most resonance CRI implementations rely on narrowband excitation and/or detection, which limits spectral coverage and makes it difficult to distinguish target molecules from backgrounds. Here we address these challenges by developing broadband electronic-resonance coherent anti-Stokes/Stokes Raman scattering (BER-CARS/CSRS) microscopy. We show that BER-CARS/CSRS enables highly sensitive, label-free imaging of endogenous chromophores with broad spectral coverage of the entire fingerprint region. Specifically, we captured time-lapse images across the fingerprint region, visualizing low-abundance cytochromes alongside abundant biomolecules (lipids, proteins, nucleic acids) in living HEK293 cells. Furthermore, we applied the method to complex biological tissues, mapping distinct distributions of cytochromes in mouse brain slices, highlighting their characteristic localizations in the cortex and the cerebral ventricle wall. Our results demonstrate that BER-CARS/CSRS is a powerful platform for highly sensitive chemical imaging, from large-area tissue mapping to organelle-level dynamics. By coupling resonance enhancement with broadband fingerprinting, BER-CARS/CSRS enables dynamic, label-free phenotyping of mitochondrial and physiological states from single cells to tissues, opening a path to quantitative, slide-scale chemical histopathology and intraoperative margin assessment.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Patients with CLTI suffer from rest pain, ulcers, or gangrene. Clinical outcomes remain poor in patients with CLTI and many investigational approaches, such as promoting angiogenesis, have failed. Understanding cell-specific vs. bulk-RNA changes within muscle offers an opportunity to better understand this disease. Objective: To assess cell-specific alterations in gene and metabolism pathways in endothelial and muscle cells from leg muscle between patients with PAD vs. non-PAD controls. Methods: We analyzed publicly available bulk RNA-seq leg muscle data from non-PAD controls, patients with intermittent claudication (IC) and CLTI. An emphasis was on glycolysis and the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP). Two single-cell RNA-seq datasets were integrated, cell types identified, and metabolism pathway scores calculated across identified cell types. Validations included quantitative mRNA in flow-sorted ECs, and immunofluorescence from clinically-phenotyped human samples. Results: Bulk RNA-seq revealed downregulation of both glycolysis and HBP in CLTI vs. IC or control tissues. Single-cell analysis uncovered cell-type specific changes. In patients with CLTI, gene expression in ECs showed increased glycolysis and decreased HBP. In myonuclei gene expression of both pathways were reduced. Flow-sorted ECs confirmed higher glycolysis and reduced HBP in CLTI vs. controls. Immunofluorescence analysis of muscle revealed significantly lower HBP?ECs (9.5% vs. 31.3%, n=5/group, p=0.004) and increased glycolytic ECs (42.0% vs. 14.4%, n=7/group, p<0.001) in CLTI vs. control. The findings were independent of capillary density. In IC patients, supervised exercise vs. optimal medical care reduced ischemic muscle PFKFB3+ ECs (2.67% vs. 14.61%, n=11 vs. 9, p<0.001). Conclusions: We generated and validated a single-cell RNA-seq data set that confirms maladaptive metabolic reprogramming in CLTI ECs.

CIRCE re-implements the Cicero workflow to analyse single-cell atlases, cutting runtime and memory use by several orders of magnitude. We also provide new options to compute metacells, grouping similar cells to reduce data sparsity. We benchmarked CIRCE against Cicero on two datasets of different sizes and demonstrated the improvement from CIRCE's metacells' strategy with promoter capture Hi-C data. We also evaluated how DNA interaction predictions are impacted by different pre-processing. We observed a negative impact of Cicero's count normalization, and the best performance was obtained with the single-cell count matrix directly. Finally, we demonstrated the scalability of CIRCE by processing a dataset of more than 700000 cells and 1 million DNA regions in less than an hour.

During metastasis, stromal infiltration requires the cancer cells to form invadopodia, a membraneprotrusion with proteolytic activity. Cues from growth factors via the cognate RTKs promote invadopodia formation and cancer cell invasion. This study demonstrated the role of the HGFMET axis in invadopodia formation and associated protease trafficking. MET interacts with MT1-MMP and is co-transported to the cell surface. Further, the RTK is found to reside at invadopodia, and its recruitment increases upon HGF stimulation due to enhanced recycling mediated by RAB4 and RAB14. The study further highlights the role of RCP in MET recycling by bringing RAB14 and MET together onto endosomal subdomains. KIF16B, a molecular motor, gets recruited to MET-containing endosomes via RAB14 and promotes the endosomal tubulation, which could be crucial for MET recycling.

We tested the hypothesis that selective Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) inhibition with the FDA-approved drug Ritlecitinib limits neointima while accelerating reendothelialization. Methods: We used mouse carotid wire injury and a human internal mammary artery (IMA) xenograft model to evaluate effects of genetic JAK3 loss in SMCs or oral Ritlecitinib in vascular remodeling. Mechanistic studies in SMCs assessed JNK/c-Jun signaling and its regulation of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) using RNA-seq and CUT&RUN. Rescue experiments tested whether VEGF-A neutralization or exogenous TSP-1 reversed the antineointimal effects. Patient-derived IMA SMCs were analyzed for variabilities in drug responses. Results: Genetic JAK3 loss in SMCs or oral Ritlecitinib reduced neointimal area and intima/media ratio and increased luminal CD31? coverage in both models. In SMCs, Ritlecitinib suppressed JNK/c-Jun signaling, downregulated TSP-1, and restored VEGF-A, shifting the milieu toward endothelial regeneration. RNA-seq and CUT&RUN corroborated JNK/c-Jun-dependent control of TSP-1 and VEGFA. VEGF-A neutralization or exogenous TSP-1 abrogated the anti-neointimal phenotype. In patient-derived IMA SMCs, variable drug response was linked to the JAK3 Pro893Asn variant and a VEGFA promoter SNP.

Female castes in both species had larger brains with pronounced mushroom bodies, supporting their broader behavioural repertoire and navigational tasks. In comparison, males exhibited smaller brains but enlarged optic lobes and central complexes, highlighting the significance of vision and orientation in mate searching. Species-specific patterns were also noted: R. metallica individuals consistently had larger antennal lobes and smaller optic lobes across castes, indicating a reliance on olfactory cues. However, the mushroom bodies remained comparatively similar.

Recent advances in light-sheet microscopy (LSM) enable whole-brain, cellular-resolution imaging of activity of all neuronal cell bodies, however most neurons from such datasets cannot be identified. In most organisms, neurons are identifiable based on their projections (and not based on their cell body position) which cannot be resolved in using LSM. Here, we present a novel methodology to overcome this by combining in vivo whole-brain activity imaging, with subsequent electron microscopy imaging of the same brain to visualise neuronal projections and identify neurons with interesting activity. We used this approach to identify brain neurons involved in nociception in Drosophila larva. After whole-brain imaging of activity during nociceptive stimulation, we imaged the same brain with an enhanced focused ion-beam electron microscope (eFIB-SEM). We registered the functional and anatomical volumes and reconstructed (in the eFIB-SEM volume) the projections of neurons that responded to nociceptive stimulation to determine their developmental lineage and identity. This revealed a distributed nociceptive network spanning 25 distinct lineages and many distinct brain areas, and included direct brain targets of nociceptive projection neurons that integrate nociceptive information with other sensory modalities, as well as brain output neurons (descending neurons [DN]) that likely contribute to action-selection. Surprisingly, we also found neurons previously previously associated with olfaction and learning, such as Kenyon cells.

By recording from the extent of the VRC using Neuropixels during optogenetic and physiological manipulations, and projecting the population activity into a dynamical latent space, we find that GABAergic lung-stretch feedback circuits promote rhythmic population activity by creating a temporary stable fixed point in the latent state that terminates diaphragmatic contraction. Stimulation of GABAergic circuits either intrinsic to the VRC (VRCGABA) or via afferent pathways from GABAergic neurons of the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract (NTSGABA) advance or delay breathing when activated with specific respiratory phase through temporary stabilization of this fixed point.

To properly interpret the motion, the brain must extract individual features and integrate them into coherent parts, and sometimes also segregate these parts from each other. Here, we performed single-neuron recordings in the motion-sensitive higher-order visual cortex (PMLS) of awake ferrets to investigate how complex motion signals are encoded and combined. We presented motion clouds---naturalistic stimuli with parametrically controlled spatiotemporal frequency content---and found that motion features were encoded in a temporally ordered sequence: orientation and spatial frequency emerged within 120 ms after stimulus onset, while temporal frequency and direction followed at later latencies. Time-resolved decoding revealed that this selectivity evolved dynamically within neurons and was distributed across the population. To probe motion integration, we introduced compound motion clouds composed of two or three localized frequency components. Neuronal responses were well explained by a linear pooling model, suggesting a simple summation mechanism of the individual components. However, a distinct subset of neurons exhibited late responses sensitive to changes in speed content despite matched marginals, consistent with receptive fields differentiating along the speed gradient.

The repressed var genes have a distinct genome organization where they localize as a cluster near the nuclear periphery and are bound by PfHP1 (P. falciparum Heterochromatin Protein 1). However, the mode of regulation of var genes by PfHP1 remains unclear. In this study, we show that PfHP1 undergoes phase separation in vitro in an RNA and DNA-dependent manner. Single-molecule DNA tethering experiments further revealed that AT-rich DNA sequences act as nucleation sites for the assembly and compaction of PfHP1-mediated heterochromatinization. We have also identified point mutations in the IDRs (intrinsically disordered regions) of PfHP1 that disrupt its phase separation as well as DNA compaction in vitro. To assess the dynamic properties of PfHP1 condensates in vivo, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) in GFP tagged PfHP1 parasites, which revealed rapid fluorescence recovery, supporting their fluidity and phase separation behaviour. Ectopic expression of PfHP1 phase separation and DNA compaction mutants led to dispersed nuclear localization of PfHP1, in contrast to the punctate appearance of the wild-type protein and altered chromatin binding at var genes. These results were corroborated with DiCre/loxP-based conditional expression of the same PfHP1 mutants, which also led to the de-repression of multiple var genes (as many as 54 out of 60 var genes), mimicking the phenotype of PfHP1 depletion mutants. Hi-C sequencing of PfHP1 mutants revealed loss of interactions in the heterochromatic regions, indicating that PfHP1 phase separation is an essential mechanism for repressive cluster formation. In conclusion, our study demonstrates the role of PfHP1-mediated phase separation in heterochromatin formation and var gene silencing; unveiling a fundamental mechanism that drives antigenic variation in P. falciparum.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Current therapeutic strategies mainly focus on managing plasma arginine and ammonia level, but long-term outcomes remain poor. While no approved treatment specific for ARG1-D is available in the United States, a recombinant protein based enzyme replacement therapy is available in Europe. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as a powerful therapeutic vehicle. By using Capricor StealthX platform, EVs were engineered to express human ARG1 on their surface or encapsulated within. Regardless of its localization on the EV membrane, nanograms of ARG1 carried by EVs were biologically active and able to convert arginine into urea as potent as micrograms of human recombinant ARG1 (rHuArg1). Furthermore, ARG1-encapsulating EVs (STX-Arg1-in) were able to deliver ARG1 intracellularly but not EVs carrying ARG1 on their surface or rHuArg1. STX-Arg1-in EVs were further evaluated in a series of in vivo studies and results showed that STX-Arg1-in EVs were non-toxic and able to restore the arginase activities in the liver of the Arg1-/- mice, which leads to a lowered plasma arginine concentration similar to wildtype mice.

The present study provides further evidence to the only preceding study aiming to accelerate precise delineation of transmission, coupling culture-free WGS to a surveillance programme. Our study is distinguished from its predecessor by being the first to apply flexible nanopore sequencing to further accelerate the process.

Despite this, the high dimensionality of molecular representations greatly complicates its sampling, analysis, and visualization. A popular approach to overcome problem is to project these representations to a \"human-manageable\" subspace, usually containing only two dimensions. Non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques are by far the preferred strategy, following the reasoning that their flexibility can accommodate any arbitrary distribution originally present in the high-dimensional space. However, this ignores the elevated computational cost of these methods and the difficulty in tuning their hyper-parameters. Here, we show that basic properties of the metrics used in the original space can be used to infer the shape of the chemical space, which in turns suggests an optimal strategy to project chemical information to lower dimensions. The key insight is to realize that, no matter the set of molecules, their fingerprint representation can be considered to lie on a hyper-spherical surface. The smooth nature of this manifold means that we can use clustering to identify locally-dense sectors of chemical space, and selectively project them simply using linear (hyper-parameter free) methods, like principal component analysis.

Lipodystrophy syndromes, often associated with metabolic co-morbidities, are estimated to affect 1 in 20,000 people. We recently showed that fibrosis- associated lipodystrophy is dependent on sustained Wnt signaling, but the mechanism is unclear. Transcriptomic profiling of mature dermal adipocytes in vivo reveal that Wnt activation downregulates the de novo-lipogenesis (DNL) axis enzymes within 48 hours. We found that protein expression of Fatty Acid Synthase (FASN), a key DNL enzyme, is dependent on sustained Wnt activation in vitro and in vivo. In human systemic sclerosis, FASN mRNA is significantly downregulated during two years of disease. Remarkably, pharmacological inhibition of FASN enzyme during reversal from Wnt induced fibrosis impedes recovery of DWAT lipid content as well as ECM accumulation and topography. All together, we demonstrate that acquired lipodystrophy in the context of skin fibrosis is mediated by a new role of the Wnt-DNL axis. These findings underscore the importance of this pathway in lipodystrophy and fibrosis, opening new avenues for therapeutic targets in skin fibrosis.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

The contribution of venous smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to the onset of DVT, particularly the mechanisms driving their phenotypic changes, remains poorly understood. Methods: We employed a murine stasis model of DVT via inferior vena cava (IVC) ligation in both male and female mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was used to analyze the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of the vein wall 24 hours post-ligation. To investigate cellular crosstalk, we utilized an in vitro system where primary mouse aortic SMCs were treated with conditioned media from inflammatory (M1-like) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). The effects on SMC phenotype and signaling were assessed using bulk RNA-seq, Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and functional assays. Results: scRNA-seq analysis revealed that DVT induction promotes a rapid inflammatory response characterized by neutrophil influx and a shift in SMCs from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype in both sexes. Infiltrating myeloid cells were identified as a primary source of signaling to SMCs. In vitro, conditioned media from M1-like macrophages was sufficient to suppress SMC contractile gene expression and function. Mechanistically, this effect was linked to the inhibition of the Hippo pathway effector YAP, evidenced by increased YAP phosphorylation (S127/S397) and a subsequent reduction of total YAP protein in SMCs. We identified macrophage-derived IL-1{beta} as a key ligand that mimics these effects. Importantly, pharmacological activation of YAP rescued contractile gene expression in SMCs exposed to the inflammatory macrophage secretome. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that SMC dedifferentiation occurs early in DVT, driven by inflammatory macrophage-mediated suppression of YAP signaling. This study uncovers a critical macrophage-SMC crosstalk mechanism in early DVT pathogenesis and highlights YAP as a potential therapeutic target to preserve vein wall integrity and prevent long-term complications.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

However, current approaches using integrating viral vectors pose clinical translation barriers, and poor long-term cell survival limits therapeutic efficacy. Objective: To develop a clinically compatible method for generating rECs using non-integrating adenoviral ETV2 (Ad-ETV2) and enhance their engraftment and therapeutic efficacy through peptide amphiphile (PA) nanomatrix encapsulation. Methods and Results: Human dermal fibroblasts were reprogrammed using Ad-ETV2 and characterized by flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, and functional assays. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in murine hindlimb ischemia with or without PA-RGDS encapsulation over 12 months. Ad-ETV2 induced robust endothelial gene expression (CDH5, KDR, PECAM1) within 6 days, with 40-50% reprogramming efficiency. KDR+ Ad-rECs demonstrated functional endothelial properties including Ac-LDL uptake, tube formation, and exceptional proangiogenic factor secretion (200-fold higher HGF than HUVECs). RNA sequencing revealed rapid transcriptional reprogramming with fibroblast gene suppression and endothelial/angiogenic gene activation. In hindlimb ischemia, Ad-rECs significantly enhanced blood flow recovery and capillary density versus controls. Long-term analysis revealed sustained vascular contribution through three mechanisms: direct incorporation, perivascular support, and vessel guidance, persisting throughout 12 months, the longest reported follow-up for reprogrammed cells. PA-RGDS encapsulation markedly improved cell retention; while 75% of cells were lost by 3 months, retention stabilized thereafter with minimal additional loss through 12 months. Conclusions: Adenoviral ETV2 delivery enables efficient generation of clinically compatible rECs without genomic integration. These cells demonstrate potent and sustained therapeutic efficacy through multiple vascular regeneration mechanisms. PA-RGDS encapsulation significantly enhances long-term engraftment, establishing this combined approach as a promising platform for treating ischemic cardiovascular diseases.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Here, we establish stable 2CLCs (s2CLCs) that maintain persistent MERVL expression and homogeneous 2C gene activation. Live-cell imaging revealed uniform and sustained MERVL activity in s2CLCs, contrasting with the heterogeneous and transient expression observed in conventional ESCs. Transcriptome profiling demonstrated robust induction of 2C-specific regulatory networks, and embryoid body differentiation combined with machine learning uncovered increased lineage variability and expanded developmental trajectories. Epigenomic profiling further revealed unique chromatin states, distinctive super enhancer landscapes, and active enhancer marking at MERVL loci.

While receptor-interacting protein kinase-3 (RIP3) and mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL) are known for their roles in necroptosis, emerging evidence highlights their non-canonical functions in metabolic regulation and cellular stress responses. However, their specific role in regulating hepatic ER stress remains unclear. This study investigates how RIP3, its kinase activity, and MLKL regulate ER stress pathways during chronic ethanol exposure and pharmacological ER stress induction. Methods: Rip3-/-, Rip3K51A/K51A and Mlkl-/- mice alongside WT controls and pharmacological necroptosis inhibitors were used to study the role of RIP3 and MLKL in modulating ER stress. Chronic ethanol feeding and pharmacological agents (tunicamycin, thapsigargin) were utilized to induce ER stress in vivo and in isolated primary hepatocytes. ER stress markers were assessed by qPCR and western blot, ER expansion was evaluated by confocal microscopy, and hepatocyte viability was measured using MTS assay. Results: Chronic ethanol increased expression of ER stress markers in WT mice; this response was attenuated in Rip3-/- mice. Tunicamycin exposure increased hepatic ER stress markers in WT mice; this response was diminished in Rip3-/-, Rip3K51A/K51A and Mlkl-/- mice. In primary hepatocytes, genetic and pharmacological inhibition of RIP3 and MLKL also reduced thapsigargin-induced ER stress responses. Hepatocytes isolated from Rip3-/-, Rip3K51A/K51A and Mlkl-/- mice exhibited enhanced cell viability under ER stress conditions compared to hepatocytes from WT mice, which was associated with ER expansion as a potential mechanism for mitigating ER stress. Conclusion: This study highlights a novel function of RIP3 and MLKL in regulating hepatic ER stress responses, expanding their known roles beyond programmed necrosis.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Although TIP60 role in stem cell maintenance and differentiation is well established, its function in stem cell derived regeneration has remain unexplored. In this study we characterized the role of TIP60 homolog, SMED-TIP60, in the planaria Schmidtea mediterranea, a odel organism renowed for its regeneration capacity. Biochemical assays confirmed SMED-TIP60 acetyl transferase and autoacetylation activity. RNAi mediated knockdown of smed-tip60 resulted in severe defects in tissue homeostasis, survival and regeneration. In situ hybridization and immunoflourescence analysis revealed a marked reduction in stem cell population and mitotic activity. Western blotting showed a peak in SMED-TIP60 expression at 5 day post amputation, suggesting a role during regeneration. RNA-seq analysis revealed widespread dysregulation of gene expression at both anterior and posterior wounds, correlating with increased TIP60 expression post injury. Notably wound response gene expression was aberrant in smed-tip60 RNAi animals, indicating TIP60 essential role in initiating wound responses and resetting positional cues.

E2F1, a canonical activator of cell-cycle genes, is sufficient to induce reentry from quiescence, but how it overcomes chromatin-mediated repression remains unclear. Here, we show that inducible E2F1 expression triggers exit from quiescence and progression through the cycle without changes in chromatin accessibility, by harnessing regulatory elements with limited, pre-existing accessibility. Using time-resolved transcriptomics, we demonstrate that E2F1 induces an accelerated transcriptional program compared to serum. Unlike serum, which triggers broad chromatin remodeling, E2F1-induced activation occurs in a context of limited accessibility. ChIP-seq reveals that E2F1 directly binds target sites in quiescent cells to upregulate canonical genes. Biochemical reconstitution shows that E2F1 binds nucleosomes and accesses internal E2F sites within histone-wrapped DNA. These findings suggest that E2F1 can engage nucleosome-associated DNA and initiate transcription without major chromatin reorganization, redefining transcription factor-chromatin dynamics during cell fate transitions and establishing E2F1 as a potent regulator of cell-cycle reentry.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Primary adult colonic epithelium barrier function is difficult to assess in a 2-dimensional (2D) in vitro format for more than a few days due to rapid cellular turnover. We developed a transwell model of the colonic epithelium that maintains proliferative and differentiated cell types, allowing long-term culture. Methods Using 3-dimensional (3D) primary human colonoids, we seeded dissociated epithelium onto 96-well transwell membranes and added different media that was growth factor specific to apical or basolateral transwell chambers. Barrier integrity was assessed using a variety of stimuli and TEER was continuously monitored in real time for up to 2 weeks, followed by quantitative single-cell image analysis using high-content imaging and deep-learning-based cell segmentation. Results Epithelium cultured up to 30 days sustained a time-dependent differentiation, leading to the establishment of a monolayer with proliferative stem/progenitor and differentiated cell types. While monitoring continuous TEER across multiple donor organoids, barrier challenge assays recorded donor-specific responses to IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Endpoint immunofluorescence analysis of tight junctions and whole cell staining identified unique cellular features among treatment groups which significantly correlated with TEER, including cell-cell orientation (e.g., adjacent cell mean angle).

P granules are a type of C. elegans germ granule proposed to be sites of mRNA repression. Proper P granule assembly is dependent on PGL-1 and its granule-forming protein relatives. Numerous RNA-binding proteins localize to P granules, like the eIF4E mRNA cap binding homolog, IFE-1. IFE-1 directly interacts with PGL-1 in vivo and in vitro. The molecular function of P granules remains enigmatic. Here, PGL-1 was molecularly dissected in vivo to determine protein regions required for P granule assembly, binding partner recruitment, and germ cell development. A specific region in the PGL-1 C-terminus was necessary and sufficient for IFE-1 recruitment to P granules and for fertility. IFE-1 RNA targets were identified, and reporters of top gene targets were repressed in the adult germline. This repression was dependent on PGL-1 and its IFE-1 binding peptide. These findings provide evidence that IFE-1 and P granules are a factor and site of mRNA repression, respectively.

In this longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we tracked how neural representations of familiar peers changed over the course of a school year among two cohorts of first-year high school students (N = 150) embedded in newly formed social networks. We assessed the extent to which individuals' neural representations of their classmates converged with group-level norms - capturing the balance between information that is idiosyncratic to each perceiver and that which is shared across perceivers - and how this changed over time. We identified brain regions where neural representations of familiar peers were well aligned across perceivers, including several areas implicated in person perception, social cognition, and visual processing. Across both cohorts of participants, neural representations in the hippocampus and lateral prefrontal cortex began as highly aligned across participants, then grew more idiosyncratic to each perceiver over time. Similar effects were observed in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, but only in one cohort of participants. Regions often linked to social cognition (temporoparietal junction, superior temporal sulcus) evinced strong encoding for group normative information at both timepoints.

More than 60 genes have been reported to be cooperatively involved in leaf adaxialization together with AS2. However, the molecular relationships between AS2 and these genes remain unclear. To identify chemical modulators of AS2 function, we screened a chemical library containing natural products and identified eight molecules, including camptothecin, that induced filamentous leaves in the as2 mutant. Camptothecin is an inhibitor of topoisomerase I, which is required for transcription of ribosomal-RNA genes, and induces nucleolar stress. Treatment with 10-hydroxy-camptothecin increased KIP-RELATED-PROTEIN5/INHIBITOR-OF-CYCLIN-DEPENDENT-KINASE3 (KRP5/ICK3) transcript levels, encoding a CDK inhibitor, and caused notable changes in the number and morphology of AS2 bodies.

In the critical 2-Cups Task subjects are signalled that a bait is hidden in one of two cups and then shown that one is empty while the other's content is not revealed. Subjects are then allowed to choose and are considered successful if they choose the unrevealed cup. We emulate the procedure using arbitrary stimuli and starlings (Sturnus unicolor) as subjects. Birds learned in encounters with single stimuli that one coloured pecking key never yielded rewards (\"empty cup\") and another yielded rewards on half the trials (\"resting cup\"). When facing only one of the two stimuli, birds displayed differential behaviour, pecking at the resting cup and not at the empty one. From the first time they faced the stimuli together they all chose appropriately. We argue that primates in the 2-Cups Task can behave similarly, with correct choices not being evidence for inference by exclusion. Studies of inference by exclusion should report data on behaviour towards single cups, to consider the possibility that simple mechanisms explain subjects' choices.

Yet most studies of group movement focus on the behaviour of single groups, usually foraging groups studied in isolation of all others. In many systems rival groups present both threats and opportunities, contributing to a landscape of intergroup conflict. This landscape could have a profound impact on group movement. Methods Here we test how the potential for intergroup conflict influences movement decisions of wild cooperatively breeding banded mongooses, using 14 years of behavioural and GPS data. In this species, encounters between groups can present both risks (e.g. injury/mortality) and opportunities (e.g., extragroup mating). We expected that, to minimise risks and maximise rewards, the motivation to engage in conflict would depend on the group's state. Such that vulnerable groups (those that were babysitting young offspring) would select den sites closer to the core of their territory than groups without young offspring. Results We found support for this pattern; non-babysitting groups were unusually risk prone choosing den locations in areas of frequent use by outgroups. During times of heightened recent conflict even choosing to den closer to the core of their rivals' territory than their own. Conclusions These results suggest that groups of banded mongooses choose den sites that reflect not only the risks but also the potential rewards of defensive or competitive claims on space.

Traditional animal models face ethical, economic, and translational limitations, while current in vitro models often oversimplify plaque formation by using fixed channels and neglecting the dynamic effects of narrowing on endothelial junctions. The study addresses the limitations by developing a microfluidic device that mimics human-relevant stenosis with dynamic channel narrowing under continuous perfusion. Endothelial cells, which are crucial for maintaining barrier integrity through tight junctions, are subjected to physiological shear stress and hyperlipidaemic conditions by administering free fatty acids. The model evaluates cell alignment, junctional stability, and disease progression under mechanically deformed static conditions. To validate the translational potential of this system, ROS scavenging drug, quercetin is tested for its ability to reverse oxidative stress and barrier dysfunction. This innovative microphysiological system offers a robust platform for investigating endothelial dysfunction in Ath and provides a valuable alternative to animal models for cardiovascular drug testing. By integrating both biochemical and mechanical cues in a controllable environment, this model aims to enhance our understanding of Ath and facilitate the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Yet, integrative studies linking structural and functional brain organization with cognitive performance remain relatively limited. In this study, we analyzed resting-state functional MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging data from 600 healthy adults aged 18 to 88, drawn from the CamCAN dataset. Using a graph signal processing framework, we investigated how structural connectivity constrains functional brain signals across the adult lifespan. Our results reveal that control and semantic cognitive systems exhibit distinct age-related patterns of structure-function reorganization, potentially reflecting a shift in integrative processing during midlife. Notably, our findings suggest that structurally-coupled sensorimotor integration plays a crucial role for regulating these systems. Until midlife, it accompanies structurally-decoupled activity in transmodal cortices to sustain cognitive control. In parallel, it likely supports the formation of embodied internal models that leverage more structurally-decoupled semantic processes, thus contributing to maintain lexical production skills for longer in older adulthood. Taken together, our study offer new multimodal insights into how sensory-driven processes help reconfigure the healthy aging brain to support controlled semantic cognition.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

R.", "abstract": "Absence epilepsy is a generalized seizure disorder marked by widespread spike-and-wave oscillations and sudden lapses in consciousness. Although no consensus exists on mechanisms of consciousness, several frameworks highlight dynamic processes relying on cortical and thalamocortical feedback loops. What those dynamics entail is an open question. Here, using interpretable machine learning, we identified a system of dynamical equations reproducing absence seizure dynamics directly from electrocorticogram recordings. The data-generated and human-interpretable model entailed multiarea synchronization on a chaotic attractor, challenging the idea of a single cortical or thalamic origin. The model contained several interconnected feedback loops which are stabilized at particular phase offsets to drive the emergence of the large amplitude seizure oscillations. High-density multielectrode recordings revealed a synchronized seizure network linking cortical layer 5 neurons of the somatosensory and motor systems with the posterior thalamic nucleus (PO), a higher order thalamic nucleus driving cortical and thalamic bursting which corresponded to the model coupling functions. Multisite optogenetics and multielectrode recordings then showed PO acts as timing-dependent gate of cortico-cortical L5 connectivity to promote the seizures. Overall, our work identifies absence seizures as corresponding to the confinement of dynamics on an attractor which relies on the same circuit substrate as has been identified for loss of consciousness in general anesthesia. This work introduces a unified approach to identify, explain, and test how distributed network instabilities contribute to a disorder of consciousness and provides an explicit dynamical framework describing the underlying multiarea feedback loops.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

The therapeutic options for CL are currently limited, and the immune dysregulation leading to chronicity of disease is poorly understood. Here, we identified interleukin (IL)-10-dependent upregulation of arginase 1 (ARG1) in cutaneous CX3CR1+ myeloid cells as central immunometabolic determinant of chronic CL in L. mexicana-infected C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice. Deletion of Arg1 in myeloid cells (Arg1{Delta}Cx3cr1) enabled parasite control and clinical healing. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that ARG1, together with interferon-{gamma} produced by T-helper 1 (Th1) cells, caused pathologic differentiation of Ly6Chigh monocytes into inflammatory macrophages (iMACs) that simultaneously expressed ARG1, nitric oxide synthase type 2 (NOS2) and the chemokines CXCL9/10. These Arg1+Nos2+Cxcl9/10+ iMACs induced a lasting depletion of L-arginine in the skin, served as parasite niche, and maintained a self-perpetuating cycle of host cell recruitment. In Arg1{Delta}Cx3cr1 mice, the ARG1+NOS2+ host cell niche for the parasite was diminished. Prophylactic or therapeutic oral L-arginine supplementation restored tissue arginine levels, reduced parasite burden, and prevented or resolved chronic disease. L-arginine-treated mice showed enhanced T cell expansion and Th1 differentiation, remained free of clinical relapses, and were resistant to reinfection. As skin lesion biopsies from L. mexicana-infected LCL and DCL patients demonstrated a similar pattern of Th1/Th2 cytokine, Arg1 and Nos2 mRNA expression as seen in mice, we suggest metabolic reprogramming by oral L-arginine as a promising and easy-to-apply host-directed therapy for human L. mexicana CL.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Dysfunction of SETX, however, has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2. Importantly, both R-loop resolution and the DDR are essential for class switch recombination (CSR) in B cells, a critical step in generating antibody diversity. Here we demonstrate that ex vivo polyclonal stimulation of SETX+/+ and SETX-/- mouse splenocytes results in equivalent amounts of IgM- and IgG-secreting B cells but significantly fewer IgA-producing B cells in SETX-/- mice. Additionally, SETX-/- mice generate significantly reduced antigen specific IgA titers following infection with influenza A virus. Sequencing of the IgA-secreting B cell repertoire revealed reduced clonal diversity in SETX-/- mice. SETX-/- mice also had increased R-loop formation within the IgA locus. Collectively, these data highlight an important role for SETX in mediating CSR to IgA.

When populations experience increased temperatures, such as during global climate change, one prediction is that their TPC can evolve to accommodate the new environmental temperature. Although studies on TPC evolution have mostly focused on modifications in population growth rates, TPC evolution can be strongly trait-dependent and require a multi-trait analysis. Thus, if and how the entire TPC across a multitude of traits evolves to change its shape in response to increased temperatures remains debated. Here, we empirically tested how the TPCs of multiple demographic, life-history and movement traits can evolve by selecting four freshwater protist species at increased temperatures starting from clonal populations. After one year of selection, populations showed a signature of evolutionary responses to the highest selection temperatures in different traits depending on the species. Particularly, we found consistent evolutionary reductions in body size in the three species having the largest cells and evolved changes in movement behaviour in all species. In contrast, we overall observed little modifications in population growth rate and in the corresponding TPC shape. These results suggest that adaptation, via evolution of TPCs, might involve the concurrent evolution of several traits. However, this may be species-specific and difficult from de-novo mutation alone, suggesting that natural populations that do not have sufficient standing genetic variation might have to be reliant on other means of mitigating the effects of climate change, such as dispersal.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Although distance sampling is the most common method for estimating population densities in mammals and birds, these and other species often violate assumptions that animals do not respond to human observers, causing biased estimates. We present an agent-based model for estimating this bias and evaluating its impact on population density estimates. Animals in our 2D agent-based model follow programmed rules. Models parameterised with either: no human avoidance, or detection of the observer by animals and fleeing behaviours, and are compared to determine the extent of bias that avoidance behaviour can introduce into population density estimates. We test this method with empirical data on responsive movement by Diana monkeys and lesser spot-nosed monkeys from hunted regions of the Gola Forest in Liberia and Sierra Leone. We find that our empirically observed i) distance at which monkeys detected observers and ii) flight initiation distances caused up to a 16% underestimate in population density. We also parameterise the model with theoretical avoidance behaviour to demonstrate the potential scale of the problem, finding up to a 93% density underestimate in extreme - but biologically plausible - cases. By making informed decisions regarding the parameterization of the model, our approach has the potential to complement existing distance sampling techniques, leading to more accurate estimates of species density. This, in turn, can aid in the effective allocation of conservation resources, making our model and its future improvements a valuable tool for researchers in the field.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

However, conventional analytical methods often lack the spatiotemporal resolution to capture dynamic cellular responses, particularly in Organ-on-a-Chip (OoC) platforms and microphysiological systems (MPS). While progress has been made in sensor development, integrating sensors into microfluidic devices remains technically challenging. Materials commonly used in microfluidics, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), are poorly suited for stable sensor integration due to low metal adhesion. Off-stoichiometry thiol-ene-epoxy (OSTE+) polymers present a promising alternative due to the presence of unreacted thiol groups. These groups enable dual functionalities: strong metal affinity for direct for robust sensor integration, and oxygen scavenging essential for microscale oxygen level control. However, their compatibility with conventional sensor fabrication methods, particularly those requiring elevated temperatures, is limited. This work introduces a low-temperature fabrication method based on inkjet printing and photonic curing, suitable for thermally sensitive substrates. Gold and silver nanoparticle inks were directly sintered onto OSTE+ using photonic curing, producing functional electrochemical sensors for spatially resolved and real-time oxygen detection. Unlike conventional thermal sintering, which is incompatible with many microfluidic materials, photonic curing preserves the chemical reactivity and mechanical properties of the polymer without requiring surface treatment or adhesive layers. To demonstrate functionality, sensors were integrated into microfluidic devices for continuous monitoring of dissolved oxygen. Real-time oxygen depletion driven by the material's intrinsic scavenging capability was successfully quantified. These findings support the compatibility of sensor integration into OSTE+ polymers enhancing the real-time monitoring capabilities in OoC and MPS systems.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Over the past decade, tremendous effort has been made in mapping neural architecture at various scales; however, the complex relationships including identifying genetic and sex-specific differences in brain structure and function remain understudied. To bridge this gap, we used C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice, two of the most widely used inbred mouse strains in neuroscience research, to investigate strain and sex-specific features of the brain connectome in awake animals using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By combining resting-state fMRI and diffusion MRI, we found that the motor, sensory, limbic, and salience networks exhibit significant differences in both functional and structural domains between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J mice.

How this capacity diversified among teleosts is an emerging question, given the recent identification of non-regenerative cardiac repair in medaka and cavefish. Here, we investigate heart restorative capacity following cryoinjury in two livebearers, platyfish and swordtails (Xiphophorus species), belonging to the Poe-ciliidae family. We demonstrate that their hearts lack the vascularized compact myocardium, which is a ventricular layer implicated in the restorative response in zebrafish. After cryoinjury, both poeciliids failed to rapidly deposit fibrotic tissue that normally reinforces the damaged site. This deficiency led to striking wound protrusion reminiscent of pseudoaneurysm after myocardial infarction in humans. Although the remaining myocardium initially increased cell proliferation, subsequently deposited collagenous scar tissue permanently sealed the interrupted ventricle, preventing complete regeneration. Transcriptomic analysis revealed several divergently regulated pathways between cryoinjured hearts of zebrafish and platyfish, particularly in immune response regulation. This was validated by delayed leukocyte infiltration and prolonged inflammation in platyfish, compared to the rapid, resolved inflammatory response in zebrafish. Our findings demonstrate that Xiphophorus species have evolved hearts with compromised regenerative capacity, characterized by pseudoaneurysm-like protrusion and permanent scarring.

To facilitate interpretation of DOM-microbe networks, we developed an integrated compound category classification (IC3) framework for assigning molecular formulae (MFs) to specific compound categories.

Hypolimnion specialist bacteria were associated with specific MFs and co-occurring taxa, providing environmental metabolomic evidence for substrate preference and potential symbiotic relations.

Neuroendocrine tumors are unique in the fact that they express high levels of the somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2), which represents a target for both tumor imaging and therapeutics. PNET grade inversely correlates with SSTR2 tumor staining and higher tumor grade is associated with poor patient prognosis. With no known mutations, SSTR2 expression is believed to be lost through aberrant epigenetic mechanisms. Enhanced knowledge of the epigenetic biology and players controlling SSTR2 expression may allow for identification of novel PNET imaging and treatment modalities. Through in-depth studies, we found that the specific de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), DNMT3B, is responsible for SSTR2 gene CpG methylation and silencing. Using DNMT3B as a starting point, along with the concept of functional crosstalk between various epigenetic mechanisms, we further discovered that Polycomb Repressor Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 and PRC2) play important roles in silencing SSTR2. Moreover, we found several histone lysine demethylases, enzymes that remove activating histone H3K4 methylation marks, to be critical for silencing expression of SSTR2. We additionally identified several chromatin remodeling enzymes/complexes as cellular factors that negatively regulate SSTR2 expression. Finally, using the HiBiT luminescent reporter system, we exploited functional chemo-genomic screens to further expand our knowledge of SSTR2 epigenetic control. These screens both reinforced several of our initial findings and helped to identify additional silencing mechanism potentially regulating SSTR2 expression. A commonality in our findings point to the presence, or necessity, of Class I HDACs in nearly all the epigenetic silencing mechanisms characterized. Overall, our work demonstrates that SSTR2 gene expression is likely silenced through various dynamic and interconnected epigenetic events, resulting in a compacted, transcriptionally repressed chromatin environment.

Mutations in BCS1L, a nuclear gene encoding an assembly factor for mitochondrial complex III (CIII), are the most common cause of pediatric CIII deficiency. The most severe phenotype, GRACILE syndrome, is caused by a homozygous Finnish founder mutation (c.A232G, p.S78G). The corresponding Bcs1lp.S78G knock-in mouse model effectively recapitulates the human disease, with juvenile-onset hepatopathy, tubulopathy, growth restriction, segmental progeria, and short survival. Here, we performed recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated gene replacement in this model, which features a postnatal presymptomatic window until weaning. A single intraperitoneal injection of rAAV encoding wild-type Bcs1l restored CIII assembly and activity in the liver, preventing hepatopathy. Hepatocyte-specific correction was sufficient to ameliorate hypoglycemia, improve growth, normalize systemic metabolism, and extend survival by nearly two-fold, despite persistent CIII deficiency in other tissues. Remarkably, liver-directed rescue also prevented skeletal muscle transcriptomic changes, particularly those linked to altered energy substrate utilization. These results underscore the central role of the liver in systemic energy homeostasis and growth regulation in multiorgan mitochondrial diseases and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of hepatocyte-directed gene replacement in phenotypes with prominent hepatopathy.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Fine-scale deletions revealed a 63-bp core module with adjacent CCAAT- and G-boxes, whereas other conserved motifs had minor, context-dependent effects.

There are currently limited tools for intravital imaging of the adult zebrafish brain. The ability to image the brain in the same individual repeatedly without physical damage would allow zebrafish to be better utilized to study aging and neurodegenerative disease. We designed and applied a 3D-printable device for non-invasive, repeatable multiphoton neural imaging of genetically non-pigmented adult zebrafish from 2 months to 2 years old. Animals successfully recovered after multi-hour imaging sessions and could be imaged repeatedly over periods of weeks to years. We show the utility of this approach through imaging the neuroimmune system, revealing that microglia in aged zebrafish have enhanced cellular dynamics.

Emerging evidence highlights the involvement of non-coding RNAs, particularly circular RNAs (circRNAs), in disease onset and progression. In this study, we investigated circRNAs implicated in ALS and related motor neuron diseases (MNDs). First, we conducted a systematic review to identify ALS-associated circRNAs, followed by in silico analyses of 15 selected candidates. Our results revealed that hsa-circ-0000099, hsa-circ-0001017, hsa-circ-004846, and hsa-circ-0034880 regulate a high number of ALS-related genes through miRNA sponging. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that hsa-circ-0000099 is particularly involved in unfolded protein response, oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. Protein-RNA interaction analysis further showed that ALS-related circRNAs can sponge 20 RNA-binding proteins, with FMR1, ELAVL1, EIF4A3, and SRSF1 exhibiting the highest number of interactions. Additionally, molecular docking analysis demonstrated that FUS mutations significantly alter its binding affinity to hsa-circ-0000567 and hsa-circ-0060762. RNA-seq data from ALS patients confirmed significant alterations in the expression of host genes of ALS-related circRNAs and hub proteins across affected tissues, including the spinal cord and multiple brain regions. Collectively, these findings support circRNAs as active contributors to ALS pathogenesis. In particular, the host gene of hsa-circ-0000099, which is expressed in the spinal cord and hippocampus, emerges as a potential biomarker for tissue-specific impairment in ALS. Moreover, its regulatory role in key ALS-related cellular pathways underscores its promise as a candidate for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting. Further experimental validation is warranted to confirm its role in ALS pathology.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

This condition continues to be extremely difficult to treat, as we grapple with its neural and behavioral complexities. What we are missing is a comprehensive account on how naive brains react to occasional and chronic cocaine use, abstinence and re-exposure within subject. We tracked naive macaques using precision functional mapping before, during and after chronic cocaine self-administration over a period of nine months. We analyzed the entire brain to illustrate the pervasive impact of chronic cocaine use on overall function. Although we set out to map the addiction connectome, we found that the neural correlates of chronic drug use and recovery are more complex that can be captured by a singular, canonical connectome. We provide a preclinical model that maps the progression of the macaque functional connectome from a naive state through chronic cocaine use, recovery and re-exposure. We demonstrate that the addiction connectome is dynamic and is characterized by the interaction of subject by drug by time. Occasional cocaine use, whether initial or re-exposure, overrides individual differences, leading to a strong homogenous effect across subjects, or convergence. However, the brain's response to prolonged cocaine use becomes more individualized, resulting in the divergence of effects across subjects. This can be explained by heterogeneity in cocaine-induced effects and in their associated timescales. Abstinence-induced neural alterations converged across subjects after 1-month, but by 2 months, individual trajectories revealed heterogeneity, possibly indicating differences in recovery.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Numerous studies demonstrate the widespread cortical engagement in conscious and unconscious processing (1-5), yet the mechanistic principle that reorganizes spatiotemporal neural dynamics across different levels of conscious access remains unclear. We addressed this using a personalized, connectome-constrained large-scale biophysical model of whole-brain source-imaged electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics recorded from participants who reported the orientation of a backward-masked Gabor patch at four levels of visibility. The key control parameter in the model is the global input gain ({gamma}) to physiologically-grounded cell populations, defined operationally such that higher {gamma} denotes weaker effective global input, which reconfigures long-range couplings and thus modulates spatiotemporal neural dynamics. Fitted {gamma} maps showed higher gain in posterior regions and lower gain in frontal regions on visible trials, whereas the pattern was opposite on invisible trials - i.e., posterior regions received weaker and frontal regions stronger input under visibility, with the opposite under invisibility. This inversion of {gamma} map was observed in pyramidal, VIP, and PV populations, while supplementary pyramidal, SST, and PV time constant were invariant. The visibility-dependent reversal in gain topography mirrored the observed spatiotemporal neural coding dynamics - under visibility, early occipital-to-frontal dynamic coding switched to stable coding, whereas in invisible condition, frontal-dominant stable coding emerged early with attenuated dynamic coding. Simulations generated from the fitted parameters reproduced the observed spatiotemporal neural coding dynamics, supporting a gain-control axis - with pyramidal input efficacy as the principal readout and coordinated VIP/PV modulation - that selects between locally integrating and globally broadcasting regimes as visibility changes.

Developmental neuroimaging literature has linked childhood PM2.5 exposure to alterations in brain morphology, microarchitecture, and function, with implications for cognition and psychopathology. However, the extant literature remains largely cross-sectional and often considers PM2.5 a single pollutant, rather than a heterogeneous mixture of chemicals from different sources. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging estimates of exposure to six PM2.5 sources derived from positive matrix factorization, and longitudinal neuroimaging data from a large, geographically-diverse sample of Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study youth (N = 6,291) from across the United States (U.S.). To identify exposure-related differences in brain function and assess their geographical generalizability, we used a predictive modeling approach to assess both differences in functional brain network connectivity during childhood (9-11 years of age) and changes in functional brain network connectivity during the transition to adolescence (9-13 years of age) related to PM2.5 exposure. Childhood PM2.5 exposure from traffic emissions and industrial/residual fuel burning were linked to mixed patterns of both stronger and weaker connectivity of sensorimotor networks at ages 9-11 years. Conversely, childhood exposures to secondary pollutants (i.e., ammonium sulfates, nitrates) were linked to largely stronger connectivity of brain networks underlying higher-order cognition that decreased over the following two years. However, these patterns of exposure-related functional connectivity identified in youth across the U.S. better represented youth living in the northeast as compared to youth living in the west.

Tracking the tuning properties of number-sensitive populations as the range changes, we show that their receptive fields shift and scale in adaptation to the range, following a structured and predictable pattern. This distributed range adaptation implements efficient coding dynamically: the resulting precision of the neural code varies with the range and is accompanied by corresponding changes in behavioral precision. At the participant level, the degree of neural tuning adaptation significantly correlates with the change in behavioral variability.

We evaluated the environmental fate and transport of FPB and its degradants in water, plants, and sediment following application of the herbicide to two bays of Lake George, NY. FPB was rapidly lost from the water column within 72 hours, consistent with prior studies, but persisted in sediments for at least one year. Sediment cores revealed vertical migration of FPB, which may contribute to frequent non-detects in surface sediments and potentially explain why US EPA was unable to establish sediment half-lives in aquatic systems. Measured concentrations exceeded the 28-day no observable adverse effect concentration (NOAEC) for chironomids for at least a year, highlighting the potential for long-term chronic exposure to benthic organisms. Modeled sorption and dilution scenarios aligned with field observations and indicated that circulation dynamics expanded the affected area beyond the direct treatment zones. These results demonstrate that FPB and its degradants persist longer in sediments than suggested by laboratory studies, raising important questions about long-term ecological risks, effects of repeated applications, and underestimation of sediment persistence. Long-term studies such as this are essential for understanding the fate of these compounds and for guiding informed decisions about future herbicide applications.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Although emerging technologies show promise, their current limitations in scalability hinder high-throughput applications. In the short to mid-term, externally added biotransformation systems (BTS: S9 and microsomal liver fractions) used together with in vitro assays offer viable alternatives. However, despite over fifty years of use, BTS are marred by reproducibility issues, raising concerns about their reliability, and raising the question: Are BTS inherently unreliable, or has their reputation been flawed by methodological oversights? This review critically evaluates BTS methodological rigour, applying a deep statistical analysis of the scientific literature. We employed Boolean operator searches across scientific literature repositories to curate a database on BTS research in conjunction with relevant in vitro assays, focusing on endocrine disruption, mutagenicity, and genotoxicity endpoints. Through systematic searches, screening, and eligibility criteria, we identified 229 bibliographic records. Data parameterisation and extraction were conducted across 24 domains of BTS relevance and reliability. Methodological reporting rigour was assessed via scoring (reported vs. non-reported data items) and revealed a lack of reproducible standards. Numerical measures associated with principal BTS reaction components were subjected to meta-regression analyses. No statistically significant correlations were found for BTS and related cofactor concentration-response relationships or time-related elements. Finally, descriptive statistics, multiple correspondence analysis, and Apriori algorithm-based relational networks identified qualitative patterns of methodological robustness and deficiencies. In conclusion, these results emphasise shortcomings across the scientific literature in complying with appropriate methodological reporting. We offer evidence-based recommendations, in the form of a conceptual regulatory guidance framework, to enhance research practices, quality, and reproducibility of BTS applications; designed to strengthen the robustness of BTS research and its integration into regulatory-relevant hazard and risk assessment of chemicals.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Among these, fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), a population of resident mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), are essential for creating a supportive microenvironment that promotes satellite cell differentiation and modulates immune responses. Our recent work revealed that adipose stromal cells (ASCs) from subcutaneous adipose tissue (ScAT) infiltrate the injured muscle within the first 24h post-injury, contributing significantly to the regenerative process. Consequently, the FAP population in the regenerating muscle comprises both resident FAPs and infiltrated ASCs. In the present study, using single cell RNA-seq in a mouse model with trackable KikGR+ ASCs and bioinformatics analyses, we identify Limch1+/Prg4+ ASCs as the primary Mobilizable ASCs (Mob-ASCs) that migrate to and infiltrate the injury site. Notably, this migration is detectable as early as 14 hours post-injury. We demonstrate that these cells are pre-activated within the ScAT, primed to initiate both migratory and regenerative programs. Intriguingly, bioinformatic inference of key activated transcription factors suggested that adipogenesis is also activated in these cells. Leveraging supervised machine learning, we tracked the fate of Mob- ASCs within the regenerating muscle post-injury, where they continue to execute these programs. Importantly, these cells lineage is cued towards a fate of adipogenesis. In vivo, we observed transient generation of adipocytes with a peak at 7-9 days post-injury to which infiltrated ASCs contributed. In vitro, conditioned media assays further revealed that adipocytes derived from ASCs, but not those from FAPs, enhance myoblasts fusion. Collectively, our findings establish Limch1+/Prg4+ ASCs as the Mobilizable ASC population and suggest that their transient adipogenic differentiation is beneficial for muscle regeneration.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

The cellular system utilizes ROS or ROS-generated metabolites to instigate signaling pathways, resulting in acclimation, growth inhibition, or programmed cell death (PCD) for sustaining stress. Various stress-generated or stress-activated signaling components and downstream pathways are identified in model plants; however, they are largely unexplored in non-model plants. Here, we report a stress-induced proteolytic activation of an evolutionarily conserved chloroplast-localized enzyme, polyphenol oxidase (PPO), that oxidizes catechins into theaflavins (TFs) and initiates a stress signaling under drought in Camellia sinensis (Tea). Germplasm-based analysis revealed a heightened proteolytic activation of PPO and consequent TFs accumulation in drought-susceptible genotypes. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PPO activation and TFs accumulation were linked to the activation of UPR(unfolded protein response)-like response, which was reinforced by virus-induced silencing and overexpression of PPO, and direct feeding of TFs in tea plants. Pharmacological treatments revealed that TFs interact with HSP90, activating a canonical IRE-bZIP60-dependent ER stress pathway resulting in PCD. Similar proteolytic activation of PPO and subsequent instigation of stress signaling in other plant species (tomato and wheat) demonstrated that PPO acts as an evolutionarily conserved stress sensor, instigating an inter-organelle communication in plants.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

We developed EcoGS (http://www.github.com/KaletaLab/EcoGS), a metabolic modelling tool designed to predict ecological interactions between pairs of microbes. Applying EcoGS to the microbiomes of two distinct human cohorts revealed a shift from collaborative to exploitative ecological interactions associated with higher dietary intake of simple sugars (glucose and fructose), in diabetic individuals and those living in industrialised lifestyles. On the other hand, the consumption of Cobalamin (vitamin B12), phylloquinone (vitamin K1) and biotin (vitamin B7), among other compounds, was associated with increased collaboration in the gut microbiome. We conclude that the abundance of simple sugars as an energy source reduces the necessity for microbes to cooperate, thereby increasing competition and hostility among microbiome members. Moreover, our study proposes multiple compounds, such as urate, deoxyadenosine, deoxyguanosine, and hypoxanthine, for in vitro validation tests as dietary interventions that have the potential to restore the ecological balance amongst the community.

However, the specific contribution of hemocyte subtypes to resilience against combined stressors remains poorly characterized. This study investigated the effect of temperature and bacterial challenge on hemocyte abundance. We employed clodronate liposomes (CLD) for the first time in honey bees as a novel tool for the selective depletion of hemocytes to investigate this gap. Methods: Five-day-old (nurses) and fifteen-day-old (foragers) honey bees were treated with CLD, control liposomes, PBS, or left untreated, then exposed at either 32C or 22C and challenged with the gram-negative bacterium, Escherichia coli, or the gram-positive bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus. Survival, hemolymph volume, total hemocyte counts, and differential hemocyte counts were monitored over seven days from the start of exposure. Results: The CLD application demonstrated significant reductions in granulocyte and prohemocyte populations, indicating the highest vulnerability. A temperature drop to 22C buffered the negative impact on survival of CLD-induced immunosuppression. While bacterial challenges universally reduced hemocyte counts, we found an age-dependent difference where nurses maintained significantly higher baseline total hemocyte counts than foragers. Furthermore, temperature did not affect overall total hemocyte counts in 5-day-old nurse bees, but in 15-day-old foragers, it significantly modulated the hemocyte response to bacterial infection. Conclusion: Our findings show that hemocyte function is non-uniform, with specific subtypes being essential for overall resilience. The results highlight a previously underappreciated role for temperature as a key modulator of immune capacity, particularly in immunocompromised bees. The age-related differences in hemocyte abundance suggest a life-history trade-off that may prompt the increased vulnerability of honey bees as they age.

Nuclear pore complex (NPC) abnormalities and disrupted nucleocytoplasmic trafficking (NCT) contribute to TDP-43 mislocalization, but how these cellular changes are initiated in disease is unclear. Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase 2 (GDE2) is a surface glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor cleaving enzyme that encodes a physiological pathway that ensures NPC integrity, appropriate NCT, and nuclear TDP-43 expression and function in adult neurons by negatively regulating canonical Wnt signaling. Notably, studies of human postmortem tissue and patient-derived neuronal models suggest that the failure of GDE2-dependent regulation of Wnt contributes to TDP-43 abnormalities in disease. Here we show that GDE2 inhibits persistent neuronal Wnt activation by regulating the surface expression of the GPI-anchored protein, Glypican-(GPC)6. Excessive GPC6 surface expression potentiates neuronal Wnt activation in vivo, resulting in NPC disruption, alterations in Ran-dependent NCT, and TDP-43 mislocalization, while genetic reduction of GPC6 in mice lacking GDE2 rescues these cellular abnormalities. Thus, GDE2, GPC6, and the canonical Wnt pathway form a physiologically important signaling axis important for NPC integrity, appropriate NCT, and TDP-43 nuclear function in neurons that, when disrupted, may underlie associated neuropathologies in disease.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Central subdivisions (LO,VO) received dominant inputs from mediodorsal and submedius thalamic nuclei and projected respectively to medial prefrontal areas and sensory cortices.

A variety of pharmacological approaches have been tried to limit cognitive symptoms and other aspects of secondary injury following mTBI. However, their efficacy and ability to treat the sequela of mTBI remains disputed and no FDA-approved drug exists for mTBI. However, neurotrophins have considerable promise as regenerative therapies for mTBI by exhibiting procognitive, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory actions. One neurotrophin, hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor MET (HGF/MET) are upregulated in response to CNS injury within the prefrontal cortex and other regions supporting memory and higher cognitive function impaired by TBI. HGF/MET activation can be anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective, yet an understanding of its actions on cognitive function after mTBI is limited. Using a closed-head midline impact model of mild TBI, we characterized the actions of the HGF/MET system on working memory performance after repeated injury. Following repeated mild TBI, the HGF/MET positive modulator dose-dependently rescued the working memory deficits following injury. These actions indicate that peptidergic transmitter systems including HGF/MET may hold critical pharmacological targets for treating the neurosequela of TBI.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

This \"no-strong-loops\" principle is thought to prevent runaway excitation and maintain stability, yet its computational impact remains unclear. Here, we use computational analysis and modeling to show that connectivity asymmetry supports high working-memory capacity, whereas increasing reciprocity reduces memory capacity and representational diversity in reservoir-computing models of recurrent neural networks. We systematically examine synthetic architectures inspired by mammalian cortical connectivity and find that sparse, modular, and hierarchical networks achieve superior performance, relative to random, small-world, or core-periphery graphs, but only when reciprocity is constrained. Validated on directed macaque and marmoset connectomes, these results indicate that restricting reciprocal motifs yields functional benefits in sparse networks, consistent with an evolutionary strategy for stable, efficient information processing in the brain.

However, the procedures for determining them are user-dependent, slow, and lack standardization, leading to long stimulation sessions with potentially inadequate outcomes. Partially automated algorithms for determining the motor threshold have been developed, but the motor hotspot is still largely mapped by hand. Automating the hotspot mapping will accelerate the process and improve standardization and accuracy. We developed a fully automated algorithm for finding the motor hotspot with multi-locus TMS and Bayesian optimization. Tested online in five healthy participants, the algorithm located motor hotspots with (mean {+/-} 95% CI) 2.1 {+/-} 0.7 mm and 6 {+/-} 2{degrees} difference from the global best target with only (mean) 47 stimuli. This is a significant improvement from previous motor-mapping algorithms, which do not optimize for stimulation location and orientation simultaneously.

Current approaches often rely on parameterized 'shifter networks' optimized with Poisson GLMs, but these methods are computationally intensive and limited to small regions of interest. We present a new framework that exploits the translation properties of Hartley basis functions to model eye position effects directly as phase shifts, eliminating the need for explicit retinal image reconstruction. This formulation admits closed-form gradients, enabling efficient parameter optimization and rapid convergence. Validation on simulated data shows that the method accurately recovers both ground-truth receptive fields and the underlying image transformation. Applied to high-density mouse V1 recordings, the approach improves receptive field sharpness by an average of 56% compared to naive estimates, with optimization completing in minutes on a standard desktop computer. While the method is specific to Hartley basis stimuli, once calibrated, it provides a reusable mapping between eye position and retinal translation. This efficiency and scalability make the technique a practical tool for receptive field mapping in free-viewing experiments and for integration with optical imaging and large-scale electrophysiology.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

While older age has been associated with declines in the ability to remember individual instances, less is known about how these declines impact concept learning and generalization or the neural systems that older adults recruit to support abstraction. In the present study, young and older adults completed a category learning task while undergoing fMRI. We fit formal prototype and exemplar models to behavioral and brain data - models that differentially index concept learning based on abstraction versus memory for individual category members. We found that the fit of both models to behavior was poorer in older adults, but older adults were more likely than young adults to be best fit by the prototype model and less likely to be best fit by the exemplar model. We also found that young and older adults recruited anterior hippocampus and VMPFC to a comparable degree to support prototype-based generalization. In contrast, older adults showed weaker old/new discrimination of category members in a set of occipital and parietal regions. These results suggest that the age-related increase in prototype reliance in behavior may be driven by declines in memory for specific exemplars coupled with a relatively intact neural system for representing prototypes.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Here we examined whether such flexibility in bimanual control extends independently across movement direction and extent. We employed a bimanual reach task in which we altered the contribution of each arm to the perpendicular (direction axis) and/or parallel (extent axis) position of a single feedback cursor controlled by both arms together. We first replicated findings of Kitchen et al. (2023) showing that when one arm contributed more to perpendicular cursor motion, its lateral variability was reduced, while variability of the other arm increased. We then extended this result to perturbations affecting movement extent, observing similar asymmetric adjustments in variability in the parallel direction. Subsequent manipulations where contributions along both axes were manipulated simultaneously, revealed that irrespective of the gain combinations, the arm with the higher perpendicular contribution showed reduced lateral variability and the arm with the higher parallel contribution demonstrated restricted parallel variability, while allowing the corresponding lower contribution arms to compensate for perturbation-induced errors. These results suggest that: 1) the sensorimotor system always prioritizes corrections for deviations directly impacting task goals while tolerating higher variability in less relevant dimensions, and 2) that it is capable of adjusting coordination along movement direction and extent largely independently based on peripheral task demands. These findings add to the growing body of evidence supporting task-dependent modulation of bimanual motor coordination.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Here we tested both behavioral and physiological effects of eliminating gap junctions in knockout (KO) mice with homozygous deletions of Cx36. In a go/no-go associative learning task, Cx36 KO mice were found to display reduced discrimination capabilities when presented with pairs of stimuli that included a monomolecular odor and mixtures that had the same monomolecular odor and a small amount of a structurally similar odor. The impairments did not occur for less similar odor pairs, suggesting that Cx36 KO mice have olfactory processing deficits that are specific to fine odor discrimination. In physiological recordings in OB slices from Cx36 KO mice, MCs displayed reduced excitation in response to electrical stimulation of sensory afferents, both single stimulus pulses as well as a theta burst pattern designed to mimic sniffing. The reduction in MC excitatory current was most prominent for late portions of their response, 300 ms after single stimulus pulses or following all theta bursts that came after the first. More global local field potentials recorded in OB glomeruli were largely unaffected by Cx36 KO. We suggest that the KO-induced impairments in fine odor discrimination are linked to reduced late MC excitation due to the longer time that mice require to make difficult odor discriminations.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

On this basis, studies have targeted contralateral motor cortical {beta} power to decode or modulate movement vigor (initiation and execution speed) non-invasively. Yet, reported behavioral effects and decoding accuracy remain modest. Considering that controlling vigor involves distributed brain regions, network-level metrics that capture interactions between cortical regions may track changes in vigor more accurately than local power. We therefore tested whether {beta} cortico-cortical coherence, measured as functional connectivity between contralateral motor cortex and other cortical areas, predicts movement vigor more reliably than {beta} power. Methods: Thirty healthy participants performed right hand opening at two instructed speeds (Fast, Slow), while high-density electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. EEG data were source-localized, and analyses were conducted at the sensor and source levels. We compared {beta} power and {beta} coherence in their ability to discriminate Fast from Slow condition. Effects were assessed across the whole scalp/cortex and using subject-specific selections of electrodes/parcels optimized for discrimination. Results: Fast trials exhibited shorter movement time (MT) and reaction time (RT) than Slow trials, indicating higher vigor. No electrodes cluster showed any significant {beta} power difference between Fast and Slow conditions. With subject-specific channel selection, {beta} power discriminated vigor above chance in most participants, but the polarity of the {beta} power contrast (Fast < Slow or Fast > Slow) varied across individuals. In contrast, with subject-specific parcel selection, {beta} coherence was consistently reduced during Fast relative to Slow in the majority of participants. Across participants, lower {beta} coherence, but not {beta} power, was significantly associated with larger Slow-Fast vigor difference. Conclusions: {beta} cortico-cortical coherence between contralateral motor cortex and other cortical regions provided a more robust and consistent predictor of movement vigor than contralateral motor cortical {beta} power. {beta} coherence exhibited a sustained reduction during fast movements across trials and participants, supporting its use as target for non-invasive neuromodulation of vigor and as feature for decoding intended movement speed.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

We present the Minds AI Filter: a lightweight, physics-based, sensor-fusion method that exploits multichannel spatial structure and band-aware synchrony to enhance neural activity while suppressing non- neural noise. The nomenclature \"AI\" reflects integration within a larger artificial-intelligence pipeline; the filter itself requires no prior training or deep learning. A single tuning parameter controls filter strength. The design supports streaming windows (approx. 1s) with minimal added latency and extends naturally to longer offline segments; leveraging a sensor-fusion design across channels, it suggests applicability to other neurophysiological time-series, such as MEG and ECoG, pending further validation; exploratory incorporation of EOG/ECG as auxiliary signals is a potential avenue for future filter advancements. We evaluate the approach across multiple devices and public datasets, assessing both down- stream AI classification performance and real-time signal-quality metrics. In both real-time and offline settings, the filter performed better on dynamic artifacts and noise than baseline and commonly used alternatives in our evaluations. When applied in conjunction with other methods, it was only observed to improve downstream accuracy, never reduce it, when any effect was present. Denoising is quantified using SNR-like measures, and ablations isolate the roles of spatial coupling and band weighting. Artifact-specific analyses (ocular bursts, head tilt, jaw clench) and latency profiling on commodity hardware are included.

Auditory cues triggered anticipatory gaze shifts to expected locations, indicating that eye movements were guided by auditory predictions rather than reactive visual responses. Violations of auditory-spatial expectations elicited longer fixations. Critically, removing auditory cues impaired predictive gaze orienting, delayed gaze orienting and increased collisions with obstacles.

Activity dependent bulk-endocytosis serves as a membrane source and autophagy initiation is induced by the energy-sensing enzyme AMPK. Intense neuronal transmission not only induces high membrane exchange and metabolic demands, but it also causes the remodeling of presynaptic molecular composition. We show that formation of BDNF/TrkB signaling amphisomes contribute to the fast turnover of key presynaptic proteins that constitute the synaptic vesicle cluster. Following sustained synaptic activity newly-formed amphisomes enable their degradation as cargo on the one hand and their replenishment by translation of mRNA localized at synaptic boutons on the other. We propose that activity-induced synaptic autophagy to a large degree represents amphisome formation that in turn is required to replace cytomatrix proteins at presynaptic sites.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

We found that tumor-reactive T cells preferentially expanded early during ex vivo TIL culture, transitioning from exhausted to reinvigorated effector states. Particularly, CD8+ exhausted T cells (Tex) and CD4+ follicular helper T cell (Tfh), but not CD4+ Tex, were efficiently reinvigorated. Further, we resolved the heterogeneity of tumor-reactive CD8+ and CD4+ subsets, defining unique signatures for their identification during TIL expansion.

Fiber assembly draws on a shared CSF pool of Sspo but requires local ciliary activity for globule-to-fibril remodeling.

However, when considering trait evolution, for example of competing species, this concept must be refined to account for evolution potentially feeding back on population dynamics. We analyze a model of two competing species whose quantitative traits evolve under stabilizing selection, assuming fixed but potentially unequal intraspecific trait variances. Using persistence theory, we derive conditions under which both species persist for all initial trait values, and we introduce the concept of near persistence, in which coexistence holds for a specific, biologically relevant, subset of initial trait configurations. Our analysis reveals that equal trait variances between species, which is commonly assumed in previous work, yield highly specific outcomes and obscure a broader set of coexistence scenarios that emerge under asymmetric trait variation. We identify fifteen distinct qualitative dynamical regimes as a function of initial conditions and trait variances. Moreover, we show that invasion analysis must often be performed at multiple eco-evolutionary equilibria, as invader dynamics may converge to different trait values depending on the ecological and evolutionary context. We discuss the biological implications of these results and perspectives for future work.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Pacific rockfishes, genus Sebastes, are group of commercially important species that primarily inhabit inshore, shelf, and slope habitats along the North American west coast. Among these, Copper and Quillback Rockfishes (abbreviated to Copper and Quillback) are closely related species known to hybridize, particularly within the Salish Sea in North America's Pacific Northwest. Here, we investigate genetic population structure and introgression patterns in Copper and Quillback from Alaska to California. Using whole-genome resequencing (WGS) across a broad geographic range, we seek to (1) compare population structure between these species, and (2) assess how introgression affects population structure patterns. Our analyses reveal that Copper exhibit much higher levels of population differentiation compared to Quillback, especially separating Salish Sea samples from all other populations. In contrast, Quillback populations appear to be nearly panmictic, with lower overall differentiation. Surprisingly, we detected signatures of introgression from 13 other rockfish species in Copper and 16 species in Quillback. This introgression was highly regional suggesting hybridization depended on geographic context and congener ranges. Yelloweye Rockfish introgression drives the strongest signal of regional population structure in Quillback. These findings provide novel insights into the range-wide genetic structure of these species and highlight that hybridization in Sebastes is phylogenetically broader than previously appreciated.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

However, the evolution of female ornamentation and its contribution to sexual dimorphism are understudied relative to male ornamentation. We addressed this knowledge gap by investigating plumage ornamentation of Tyranni (Suboscines). We hypothesized that greater ornamentation is associated with stronger sociosexual selection in females and males, and that sexual dimorphism emerges when selection pressures differ between sexes. We tested associations of ornamentation and sexual dimorphism with territoriality, mating system, parental care, nest type, migratory behavior, and climatic seasonality. We found that females and males show similarly high ornamentation (elaborate monomorphism) in territorial, non-migratory, monogamous species with biparental care, and species nesting in cavities. In contrast, males show higher ornamentation than females in migratory and polygynous species with female-only parental care and in more seasonal climates, though these cases were less common than elaborate monomorphism. Our findings suggest that when the sexes share sociosexual selection pressures, they show similar ornamentation, whether elaborate or inconspicuous. Conversely, sexual dimorphism is greater when males face stronger sociosexual selection pressures than females. Our study provides a framework for testing how sociosexual selection shapes female traits, which is key to understanding the evolution of sex differences and similarities.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

J.; Sankari, S.", "abstract": "Symbiotic relationships have an important role in most life forms, but the molecular and cellular processes that establish and maintain these harmonious interactions remain largely unknown. The relationship between leguminous plants and rhizobial bacteria is a classic example of symbiosis, where the bacterium converts atmospheric nitrogen to plant-usable ammonia in exchange for fixed carbon and nutrients. Some legumes such as Medicago truncatula has evolved a set of small peptides that exploit this relationship, turning its bacterial partner, Sinorhizobium meliloti, into a terminally differentiated bacterium that loses its capability to survive outside the host. However, the mechanisms of how this transformation happens remain elusive due to the absence of high-throughput tools for targeted gene knockdowns in the bacterium. To overcome these limitations in the plant-rhizobia field, we developed an inducible CRISPR-interference knockdown system which can reversibly block the transcription of a target gene through the combined action of a deactivated-Cas9 (dCas9) and single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). We used a taurine-inducible promoter to achieve fine-tunable expression levels of dCas9 in free-living S. meliloti and demonstrated that this tool is suitable for the study of essential genes that could be involved in the symbiotic process, including hemH, dnaN and ctrA. Our cost-effective inducible CRISPRi strategy will contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying legume-rhizobia symbiosis, ultimately allowing soil improvement and reducing chemical fertilizers usage while meeting global food demands.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

We generated a Marfan mouse model (Fbn1Q2469X/+ ) carrying the FBN1Q2467X nonsense mutation identified in patients. This mutation results in fibrillin-1 deficiency and predisposes heterozygous mice to aortic root dilation and ascending aortic aneurysm under metabolic stress, such as a high-fat diet. Homozygous Fbn1Q2469X/Q2469X mice develop spontaneous thoracic aortic aneurysms that uniformly progress to rupture between 10 and 25 days of age, with 100% penetrance. Histopathology shows progressive vessel wall degeneration characterized by disorganized vascular smooth muscle cells, collagen loss, and elastic fiber fragmentation from early to late stages. Transcriptomic analysis identifies inflammation as the dominant process in late-stage aneurysms. Immunofluorescence assay reveals inflammatory cells prominently localized to the adventitia near rupture sites, linking adventitial inflammation to aneurysm progression.

Controlling tsetse fly populations is crucial for mitigating the socio-economic impact of this disease, as effective treatments remain challenging. Indeed, the development of control strategies is hindered by the species' unique reproductive biology: adenotrophic viviparity, in which the female retains and nourishes the developing larva in her uterus throughout the pregnancy. The discovery of Spiroplasma in some G. f. fuscipes populations has drawn attention as a potential tool to enhance tsetse fly control strategies. Although Spiroplasma does not exhibit in G. f. fuscipes the male-killing phenotype observed in Drosophila melanogaster, evidence suggests that it may confer refractoriness to Trypanosoma infection. This has led to further investigations into its broader effects on G. f. fuscipes biology, particularly its potential impact on Glossina reproductive fitness. In this study, we considered Spiroplasma effect on the male reproduction. For this, we performed a differential gene expression analysis on testes and male accessory glands (MAGs) between Spiroplasma-infected and uninfected males. A significant downregulation of genes was observed in testes while a minor effect has been detected on MAGs. Downregulation of testes genes associated with functions related to sperm motility, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial function has been observed. Additionally, differentially expressed genes involved in antimicrobial activity and circadian rhythm regulation were observed. These findings provide valuable insights into the potential fitness costs of Spiroplasma infection for the fly and its implications for the bacterium use as biological control strategies targeting G. f. fuscipes.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

It is used in a broad range of behaviours, such as parental care. Acoustic communication is also involved in the brood care of Nicrophorus vespilloides (HERBST 1783), which, together with the other burying beetles, are one of the rare exceptions among insects in that they practice biparental brood care. Previous studies showed that a lack of acoustic communication in burying beetles negatively affects the weight and survival rate of their offspring (Conrad et al. 2024). However, it remained unclear whether these results were mainly based on prenatal or postnatal effects of silencing. Therefore, in this study we wanted to find out whether negative effects on N. vespilloides larvae, which are due to a lack of prenatal acoustic communication between the parents, can be compensated by the postnatal brood care of stridulating foster parents. For this purpose, we applied parafilm on the pars stridens of some beetle pairs so that they could no longer stridulate. In a 2 x 2 cross-fostering experiment, larvae originating from silenced or stridulating parents were reared by either silenced or stridulating foster parents. The larvae of silenced parents showed a lower hatching weight than the larvae of control parents. At dispersal, larvae with stridulating original and foster parents were significantly heavier than those reared by silenced foster parents, from either origin. At dispersal, larvae with stridulating original and foster parents were significantly heavier than those reared by silenced foster parents, from either origin. Thus, the stridulating foster parents were apparently able to partially compensate the initial weight deficits of the larvae from silenced original parents. There were no effects of silencing on offspring survival. Our experiment demonstrates that post-hatching acoustic communication during brood care of N. vespilloides is of greater importance for larval growth than pre-hatching acoustic communication. Still, the inability to stridulate compromises the quality of both prenatal and postnatal care. It is conceivable that the acoustic communication of the parents provides orientation for the larvae when feeding, or that the adults coordinate their tasks and negotiate their parental investment. Our findings contribute further to our understanding of the function of parental communication during brood care.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

In rodents, voluntary wheel running can attenuate the effects of both physical and social stressors on rodent social behavior. Whether wheel running affects rodent social behaviors per se remains less well understood. We conducted the current study to test whether home cage access to running wheels impacts the social behaviors of adult, group-housed C57BL/6J female mice during same-sex interactions with novel females. Group-housed females were either given continuous home cage running wheel access or a standard paper hut starting at weaning, and as adults, the social behaviors of females from these two groups were measured during interactions with novel female mice. In two cohorts of females, we found that 5 weeks of running wheel access during adolescence reduced the time that female subjects spent engaged in social investigation of a novel female and also tended to reduce total ultrasonic vocalizations produced during interactions. These effects were not reversed by a 2-week period in which running wheels were removed. Finally, we found that a 2-week period of running wheel access in adulthood recapitulates the effects of 5 weeks of running wheel access on female social investigation. Overall, we find that running wheel access has an enduring inhibitory influence on female social behavior during same-sex interactions, a finding that has implications for the design of studies that include same-sex interactions between female mice.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

R.; Foscue, E. P.; Diaz, D. M.; Thompson, S. L.; Malison, R. T.; Sinha, R.; Taylor, J. R.; DiLeone, R. J.", "abstract": "Rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose deaths have increased dramatically in recent years. Currently approved medications for OUD include the opioid agonists methadone and buprenorphine, and the opioid antagonist naltrexone. However, relapse rates are high due to an impaired ability for addicts to control their urge to consume due to strong cravings, and the extreme severity of withdrawal symptoms. Additionally, the nature of the agonists can lead to abuse of those compounds as well. Non-opioid targets, such as glutamate receptors, are potentially ideal for developing intervention strategies with the goal of reducing OUD, relapse, and overdose death. NYX-783 is a small molecule positive allosteric modulator for the glutamate receptor NMDA. It has been shown to modulate learning and memory, both of which are impaired in drug addicts, and known play a role in relapse. Using mice, we have conducted preclinical studies to evaluate the potential for NYX-783 as a therapeutic for OUD with assessment of several outcomes: 1) respiratory depression, 2) consumption during maintenance of regular consumption as well as post-abstinence reinstatement, 3) motivation for consumption, 4) somatic withdrawals, and 5) the development of aversion to withdrawal symptoms. For respiratory depression studies, mice were pretreated 1h prior with NYX-783 and respiratory rates were monitored for 15min after each escalating dose of oxycodone. No effects were seen for any dose of NYX-783. To test for effects on drug consumption, mice were trained to orally self-administer oxycodone and then treated every two days with different doses of NYX-783 or entering an abstinence phase prior to testing with NYX-783. No effect on intake at clinically-relevant doses was observed during regular maintenance or post-abstinence intake. Additionally, we used a progressive ratio to assess the motivation self-administering mice had for reward acquisition, and no effect of NYX-783 was observed on rewards earned. We next evaluated withdrawal using two separate paradigms to test for effects of NYX-783 on, 1) for somatic withdrawal symptoms, 2) aversion to the state of withdrawal. For somatic withdrawal, using higher doses of naloxone (1 mg/kg), NYX-783 did not attenuate jumping behavior. For aversion to withdrawal, three aversion pairings were completed that consisted of oxycodone treatment, followed by NYX-783 preceding a low dose of naloxone (0.1mg/kg ip) immediately before pairing in a specific context. These alternated with neutral (saline) pairings daily. We observed a significant improvement in aversion scores in female mice treated with NYX-783, and a trending significant improvement in males. This suggests a potential therapeutic use for NYX-783 in reducing the negative state of withdrawal that can drive relapse in OUD.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Experimental studies have shown that the provisioning capacity of female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) is limited by their risk of overheating. Given that parental investment strategies may vary between sexes, the thermal environment may have a different impact on males. We experimentally trimmed ventral feathers from male tree swallows to create a thermal window through which they could dissipate heat. We remotely monitored provisioning rate and core body temperature of males and their female partners. At high temperatures, all males decreased their nestling provisioning rates irrespective of trimming treatment. In addition, trimmed males maintained core body temperatures similar to those of controls. This suggests that in contrast to previous work with females, males limit provisioning rates to levels below the threshold at which they would overheat. Females paired with trimmed males adjusted their own activity to match that of their male partners; whether there are costs to females is unknown. Combined, these studies highlight that sex-specific differences in thermal physiology and behavior must be considered when predicting responses to climatic warming.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

We formalize state predictability as a quantitative proxy for plasticity, where stable states are predictable and plastic states are not. Applied to epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) in breast cancer, the framework shows that mesenchymal states are stabilized by recurrent copy number alterations and microenvironmental cues, whereas hybrid states remain unpredictable and plastic.

Here we assess sex chromosome complement in three widely-used human genomics datasets from normal (non-cancerous) tissues, primary tumors, and cancer cell lines and study the effects on genome-wide gene expression. Expected sex chromosome complements based on reported patient sex were observed in non-cancerous tissues, but about half of tumors and cancer cell lines showed loss of typical sex chromosome gene expression across tissue types with three categories: loss of chromosome Y (LOY), loss of chromosome X (LOX) and reactivation of the inactive X chromosome (XaXa). Genes consistently differentially expressed in tumors with loss of chromosome X, loss of chromosome Y, or loss of X chromosome inactivation are associated with the hallmarks of cancer and include both sex-linked and autosomal genes from nearly all chromosomes, druggable genes, and genes with molecular functions relevant to cancer signaling, such as kinase activity. Strikingly, tumors that are X0, including tumors from female patients that have lost an X chromosome and tumors from male patients that have lost a Y chromosome, cluster together by gene expression profile. Patients with tumors that have LOX or LOY had poorer survival outcomes compared to those with tumors that had maintained their sex chromosome complement. Further, LOX and LOY eliminates nearly all of the differential gene expression between tumors from different patient sexes, affecting sex chromosomal and autosomal gene expression.

However, some cancer cells resist viral infection through the constitutive expression of interferon-stimulated genes. This study examined whether NF{kappa}B activation and NF{kappa}B dependent antiviral signaling contributes to resistance to VSV infection in the PC3 cell line, derived from an aggressive metastatic prostate cancer (PrCa) tumor. We found that NF{kappa}B localized to the nucleus in VSV-infected PC3 cells, but not in the VSV susceptible LNCaP PrCa cell line. Analysis of the upstream NF{kappa}B inhibitor I{kappa}Ba revealed higher levels of both total and phosphorylated I{kappa}Ba in PC3 cells compared to LNCaP cells, indicating constitutive activation of the NF{kappa}B pathway via an I{kappa}Ba dependent mechanism. Notably, VSV infection did not alter I{kappa}Ba phosphorylation in PC3 cells, suggesting that VSV may amplify NF{kappa}B signaling through an I{kappa}Ba independent pathway. Furthermore, PC3 cells displayed elevated levels of the NF-{kappa}B p65 protein subunit compared to LNCaP cells, with its phosphorylated form significantly increased upon VSV infection. These results from phosphorylation assays confirm that multiple steps in the NF{kappa}B pathway are differentially activated in PC3 and LNCaP cells. Additionally, the expression of several NF{kappa}B-dependent cytokine and proinflammatory genes, including IL12 and IL6, were upregulated following VSV infection in PC3 cells, as compared to LNCaP cells. Blocking the NF{kappa}B pathway using a pharmaceutical inhibitor resulted in increased PC3 cell death with VSV infection.

The extract was subjected to a vacuum liquid chromatographic technique, and the extract and fractions were subjected to bench-top biological assay using the growth inhibitory radicle of Sorghum bicolor at a concentration (1-30 mg/mL) for duration of 96 h. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used in data analysis and was represented as Mean Standard Error of Mean (SEM). Results: Secondary metabolites present in the extract were alkaloids, tannins, flavonoids, phenolic compounds, reducing sugar, terpenoids, proteins and amino acids, and phytosterols. The results revealed that the length of seed radicles progressively increased over time. The results showed that the length of seed radicles progressively increased over time. The extract reduced the length of the seed radicle by 14.51-58.39% and 66.44-84.74% at 20 and 30 mg/mL. The bulked vlc fractions BAF, BBF, and BDF significantly reduced the length of the radicle at 5 and 10 mg/mL, and bulked vlc BCF was effective at 10 mg/mL only. Conclusion: The study showed that the extract of C. icaco and its vlc fractions possess an anti-proliferative effect with medical relevance in the development of anticancer therapy. The growth inhibitory effects of the extract of C. icaco and its vlc fraction on Sorghum bicolor could be linked to the phytochemicals present, associated with potential anticancer activity.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

While progression to sAML is classically linked to MPN clones acquiring additional mutations, the absence of JAK2V617F in some cases of post-MPN sAML cases suggests alternative mechanisms of transformation. Utilizing patient samples and in vivo modeling, we establish that leukemic clones can emerge independently of JAK2-mutant cells and undergo positive selection in the pro-inflammatory MPN environment, leading to parallel disease evolution.

A.; Mashimo, H.; Frank, M.; Frank, N.", "abstract": "Background: Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) frequently arises from chronic exposure to acid and bile reflux, with secondary bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA), contributing to its pathogenesis through mechanisms involving reactive oxygen species (ROS), oxidative DNA damage, and resistance to apoptosis. The human endocannabinoid system (ECS) regulates diverse anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and analgesic pathways implicated in disease modulation. Despite its therapeutic promise, effective pharmacological activation of the ECS remains challenging. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate whether specific cannabinoid-terpene combinations targeting the ECS could attenuate the mutagenic and cytotoxic effects of bile acid induced stress in esophageal cell models. Additionally, we assessed the clinical significance of ECS-related protein receptors in the progression of EAC. Design: In vitro experimental models combined with clinical samples analyses. Methods: We utilized in vitro models, including human esophageal epithelial cell lines exposed to DCA and a Barrett's esophagus gastroesophageal reflux (GER) model subjected to low pH and a bile acid cocktail. Patient derived samples were analyzed to investigate the clinical association of ECS pathway markers with EAC progression. Experimental models were treated with varying ratios of phyto-cannabinoids and terpenes. Endpoints included assessment of DNA damage, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ROS production to identify optimal compound combinations. Expression of ECS-related protein receptors was evaluated in clinical samples to elucidate their role in EAC development. Results: A 1:5 ratio of cannabigerol (CBG) to Phytol (Phy) was found to significantly reduce DCA induced DNA damage, preserve mitochondrial membrane potential, and decrease ROS levels. This combination also enhanced apoptosis in damaged cells and diminished mutagenicity. Analysis of patient samples revealed that the expression of the ECS-associated receptor protein CB1 correlated with EAC progression, suggesting a broader clinical role for ECS modulation in cancer prevention. Conclusion: Modulation of the ECS through carefully selected cannabinoid terpene ratios can mitigate bile acid induced esophageal damage and may reduce carcinogenic progression. These findings support further in vivo investigations and raise the possibility of expanding cannabinoid terpene therapeutics to other conditions involving similar pathogenic processes.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

The zebrafish is a model with the benefits of external development, fecundity, optical transparency, and hemostasis that demonstrates conservation with mammals. We utilized zebrafish as a phenotypic screening tool to identify novel therapeutic options for preventing VTE. A library of FDA-approved compounds was screened for suppression of acquired (elevated estrogen) and spontaneous (protein C deficiency) thrombosis. We found that thyroid hormone, receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitors, and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) effectively modulated levels of thrombosis, particularly in the estrogen-induced model. These also showed a more favorable hemostatic profile than standard therapies, suggesting alternative mechanisms. Genome editing of thyroid hormone receptor proved that thyroid hormone action is on target. A retrospective electronic health record (EHR) analysis found that thyroid-hormone prescriptions in hormonal contraceptive users correlated with a higher VTE risk, potentially limiting direct repurposing but highlighting thyroid signaling as a pathway involved in estrogen-induced thrombosis.

Despite the consensus that BAT is inactive under warm ambient temperatures, few studies have sought to examine the metabolic remodelling that occurs when recovering from the cold and re-acclimating to thermoneutral environments (28-32{degrees}C). To elucidate mitochondrial functional and structural aspects involved in BAT metabolic remodelling during cold deacclimation, we acclimated C57BL/6J mice to the cold (4{degrees}C) for 7 days, and subsequently transferred them to thermoneutrality (30{degrees}C) for 3 h, 12 h, 24 h, or 48 h. Comprehensive metabolic phenotyping analyses demonstrated elevated metabolic rates and high food intake during the cold acclimation period, which immediately decreased by ~40% upon returning to thermoneutrality. High-resolution respirometry of saponin-permeabilized BAT revealed decreases in mitochondrial leak uncoupling by 24 h of cold deacclimation, which corresponded with gradual declines in mitochondrial protein content and UCP1 gene expression. Decreases in BAT mitochondrial content paralleled declines in protein content, as indicated by decreases in the mtDNA/nDNA ratio and mitochondrial surface area by 48 h of cold deacclimation. Metabolomic analysis of BAT from cold-acclimated mice and from mice deacclimated for 48 h at thermoneutrality revealed major changes in pathways related to amino acid metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), glutathione, and purine metabolism. Marked decreases in the abundance of N-acetylated amino acids in cold deacclimated mice corresponded with increased aminoacylase 1 (Acy1) expression.

Therefore, we hypothesized that a blocking recombinant-murine IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) would rescue cardiac function in WD-fed mice. Methods: In this 9-week study, 10-week-old adult C57BL/6J mice were assigned to standard diet (SD) or a WD. After 7 weeks of WD feeding, the mice were assigned to two groups: WD+IL-18BP (0.5 mg/kg daily, intraperitoneal injections) or WD control for the last 2 weeks of the study. Food intake, body weight, and glucose tolerance were assessed. Cardiac systolic and diastolic function were measured by Doppler echocardiography at baseline, 5 weeks, and 9 weeks. IL-18 plasma levels were quantified with ELISA. Results: WD induced a significant increase in body weight, significantly worsened glucose tolerance, and significantly increased (worsening) in diastolic function (isovolumetric relaxation time -IRT- and myocardial performance index -MPI-) compared to SD. Rescue with IL-18BP in WD-fed mice resulted in a significant improvement in IRT and MPI, without significant changes in food intake, weight gain, or glucose tolerance. Conclusions: IL-18BP rescued cardiac function in mice with WD-induced diastolic dysfunction, independent of weight gain and glucose tolerance.

Although the functions of many autophagy-related genes under high-temperature stress have been characterized, the role of SlATG8f, a key member of the SlATG8 family in tomato, remains poorly understood. In this study, we generated SlATG8f-Overexpressing tomato lines using the recombinant vector pBWA(V)HS. Using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we analyzed physiological indices and expression levels of ATG8 family members and heat shock protein-related genes in fruits of wild-type (WT) and SlATG8f-overexpressing plants across four developmental stages under high-temperature stress. Our results indicate that overexpression of SlATG8f upregulates the expression of autophagy-related and heat shock protein genes, promotes early fruit ripening, and improves fruit quality under high-temperature stress.

In mammalian cells, metabolic objectives are layered and context-dependent, making it difficult to pinpoint the priorities that underlie observed phenotypes. Here, we introduce ObjFind-M, an inverse optimization framework that infers reaction-level metabolic objectives in mammalian cells directly from fluxomic and metabolomic data. Using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a data-rich mammalian cell system, ObjFind-M consistently identifies mitochondrial ATP synthase as the central metabolic driver, supported by key TCA cycle and electron transport chain nodes. Priorities adjust with cellular state, favoring glycolysis-TCA coupling in the growth phase and shifting toward oxidative phosphorylation and redox balance when proliferative activity slows. High recombinant protein producing CHO cells emphasize citrate shuttling and beta-oxidation, linking energy supply with biosynthetic capacity for protein secretion. Benchmarking against conventional objectives demonstrates that maximizing ATP production most accurately reproduces experimental fluxes.

M.; Rosenberg, M. D.; Vogel, E. K.", "abstract": "Distraction is a universal feature of human cognition, yet the reasons why it occurs remain poorly understood. Theories of sustained attention often point to failures of cognitive control in maintaining the task-set, while data-driven approaches suggest that distraction may instead reflect a breakdown in the selection of task-relevant information. This study aimed to better characterize the neural mechanisms of distraction and to test whether its EEG-based signature reflects a unique pattern or merely overlaps with failures in selective attention or task-set maintenance. Twenty adults completed a sustained attention go/no-go task (3,200 trials) while focusing on either numbers or letters, with EEG recorded simultaneously. Distraction was examined at two complementary levels: (i) trial-level lapses, defined as no-go errors, and (ii) attentional states, derived from reaction-time variability and categorized as 'in-the-zone' versus 'out-of-the-zone'. Across both levels, distraction was associated with attenuated event-related potentials, most notably a reduced P3 amplitude over parietal regions. Whole-scalp inter-electrode correlation analyses revealed weaker large-scale neural coordination during distraction. To isolate a unique EEG marker, we trained a machine-learning classifier to decode attentional state from EEG activity. Cross-validated decoding accuracy reached ~80% and remained robust even after controlling for reaction time, demonstrating that the signal captures information beyond overt performance. Finally, representational similarity analysis and additional classifiers confirmed that this neural signature is unique, as it was dissociable from other forms of attention, including the selection of the relevant stimulus side (left vs. right) and the control required for task-set maintenance (letter vs. number). Together, these findings reveal convergent neural markers of distraction and demonstrate the existence of a single EEG-derived signature that reliably predicts distraction, independently of behavior and other cognitive processes.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Humans exhibit structured patterns of memory recall, including a tendency to recall more recent information and to recall events in the same order they were experienced. Classic computational models explain these patterns by positing that memories incorporate the ongoing ''temporal context'', formed by smoothly integrating the stimulus history. However, it is unclear whether a single mechanism can account for the full repertoire of human memory strategies, as the optimal approach may be task-dependent. For example, human memory experts widely apply the ''memory palace'' strategy, which is empirically better but not captured by temporal context models. Here we show that neural networks optimized for free recall develop diverse retrieval strategies, with only some of them resembling temporal context models. The best-performing models discovered a stimulus-invariant index code that emphasizes the studied position of each list item, instead of its temporal context. This creates a stable scaffold for forward recall akin to the memory palace technique. This index code was more likely to emerge when networks were i) encouraged to recall all studied items rather than prioritizing a few items, and ii) prevented from relying on recency, resonating with human data. Our findings demonstrate that human-like recall patterns can arise from multiple distinct computational mechanisms, and that sequential retrieval using item index is an optimal strategy that explains expert-level recall performance.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Clinical and preclinical data indicate that individuals with stress-related disorders and rodents exposed to chronic stress exhibit impaired behavioral flexibility. The lateral habenula (LHb) has emerged as a key brain region contributing to the effects of stress on cognitive performance. However, the extent to which the LHb is recruited to fine-tune decision-making strategies, as well as the impacts of chronic stress on LHb recruitment during task performance, remain largely unknown. To this end, we used a three-week model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) and performed in vivo fiber photometry to investigate Ca2+ transients in LHb neurons during an attentional set-shifting task in adult male and female Sprague Dawley rats (n=7-12/sex/group). We found that CUS exposure did not significantly impair behavioral flexibility. Rather, CUS-exposed rats made fewer omissions and exhibited shorter response latencies compared to controls, suggesting enhanced task engagement. We also observed sex differences in LHb Ca2+ activity. In control animals, we found that male rats showed stronger LHb signal prior to decision making, and greater activation following trial outcome than females. These differences were normalized by CUS, resulting in similar signaling patterns across sexes. Altogether, these findings reveal that chronic stress alters LHb activity in a sex-dependent manner without overtly impairing behavioral flexibility, thereby underscoring the importance of the LHb in decision making under stressful conditions.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

However, to leverage preparatory activity for clinical BCIs, we must first understand which features of upcoming movements are encoded by preparatory activity in humans. In this work, we collected intracortical recordings from 3 research participants in the BrainGate2 clinical trial to investigate whether diverse features of movement, such as direction, curvature, and distance, are encoded by preparatory activity in the human motor cortex. We first show that preparatory activity is tuned to the direction of upcoming movements, and this tuning is largely preserved across movements with different effectors. Further investigation demonstrated this preparatory activity is also informative of initial and endpoint directions of curved movement trajectories, and encodes movement distance and speed independently. Finally, we present an online control paradigm that leverages preparatory activity to predict movements towards intended directions in advance, yielding rapid, self-paced control of a computer cursor by human participants.

Environmental boundaries are among the most salient and reliable spatial cues, supporting both spatial memory and orientation. Here, we investigated how aging affects the use and the neural representation of boundary information during a virtual object location memory task. Healthy young and older adults navigated a square virtual environment while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging, allowing us to assess moment-to-moment encoding of distance to environmental boundaries in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum. Behaviorally, both age groups showed more accurate memory for objects located near boundaries, but this effect was amplified in older adults, whose spatial precision declined more steeply with increasing distance from boundaries. Older adults also exhibited a stronger bias to recall objects closer to boundaries. Analysis of navigation behaviour revealed that older adults followed boundary-oriented paths regardless of target location, whereas young adults flexibly adapted their navigation based on spatial context. Neurally, older adults - but not young adults - showed significant blood-oxygen-level-dependent modulation by boundary distance in the entorhinal cortex and subiculum, with activity decreasing as participants moved farther from boundaries. This effect was most pronounced in low-performing older adults and was associated with stronger behavioral boundary bias, suggesting a maladaptive reliance on proximity-based cues. Together, our results provide converging behavioral and neural evidence that aging alters the use and representation of boundary information, with downstream effects on spatial memory.

However, conventional univariate rt-fMRI-NF approaches are limited in their ability to distinguish neural patterns of distinct emotions that involve overlapping brain regions. In this study, we applied an rt-fMRI semantic neurofeedback (rt-fMRI-sNF) paradigm, incorporating real-time representational similarity analysis (rt-RSA) to enable navigation between emotional states. Four emotional patterns were first derived from functional localizer runs, each designed to evoke a specific emotion, and then applied as target patterns during neurofeedback. Using an RSA-informed circular semantic map (CSM), participants received real-time visual feedback indicating both the similarity and intensity of their current brain activity relative to target emotional patterns. Participants were instructed to use mental imagery to shift their brain activity toward the specific target pattern and increase its intensity. Twenty-four healthy participants completed the localizer runs, and two consecutive neurofeedback runs in the same session. Ten participants successfully engaged with both the similarity and intensity components of the CSM, showing effective modulations of their mental states. Analyses of the localizer runs revealed overlapping regional activations across emotions and demonstrated that RSA outperformed univariate analysis in distinguishing between them. For the neurofeedback runs, linear mixed-effects model (LMM) analyses across multiple performance metrics indicated consistent within-run improvements and higher initial performance in the second run, while significant between-run learning effects emerged only in exploratory models with quadratic time terms. A block-wise comparison also showed significantly higher performance at the end of each run compared to the beginning based on the intensity metric. These findings support the usability of RSA in differentiating multiple emotional states and demonstrate the feasibility of the rt-fMRI-sNF paradigm for emotion regulation.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

It has been shown that ongoing brain network dynamics can be reliably inferred at fast, sub-second timescales from electrophysiological data using unsupervised machine learning. However, these methods often struggle with inherent trade-offs. For example, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been used to infer categorical brain network states that provide good interpretability but do not model long-range temporal structure. Recently, deep learning approaches using recurrent neural networks (e.g., Dynamic Network Modes) have been proposed to model long-range temporal dependencies, but at the expense of interpretability. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Network States (DyNeStE) to address this problem. This new model employs amortised Bayesian inference with recurrent neural networks to model long-range temporal structure and uses a Gumbel-Softmax distribution to enforce categorical states for greater interpretability. In both simulations and real resting-state magnetoencephalography data, DyNeStE was able to recover plausible dynamic brain network states and showed superior performance over the HMM in capturing long-range temporal dependencies in network dynamics. These dynamic networks were reproducible across independent data splits and build on established HMM-based findings.

RESULTS: Our method identifies regulatory genes from both transcription factors (TFs) and non-TFs, thereby capturing a complete and accurate causal regulatory map across different brain cell types. This work revealed both established and novel regulations, pathways, and cell-type-unique hub genes in AD. Beyond constructing transcriptome-wide GRNs, we quantitatively assessed hub genes and distinguished those with regulatory or responsive roles.

In particular, microglial states have been characterized in Alzheimer's disease and mouse models of amyloidosis. Although single-cell transcriptomic technologies have increased the dimensionality of information available across cell states, few studies have systematically tested for changes in glial transcription across brain regions and disease states. Here, we report a statistical framework for glial annotation, disease association, and transcriptional profiling, which facilitate identification of generalizable glial states that are present across a spectrum of NDDs (Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Frontotemporal dementia). We identify seven astrocyte substates, 14 microglia/myeloid substates, and five oligodendrocyte substates where transcriptional variability is attributable to region, disease, or batch effects. Regional heterogeneity of astrocytes masked disease associations, even within cortical astrocytes. We found only limited oligodendrocyte transcriptional heterogeneity, resulting in few substates for further interrogation. Notably, microglia showed the strongest evidence for disease association. We show, for the first time, that this association exists across the entire NDD spectrum. Using latent factor analysis, we created a consensus human neurodegenerative disease-associated microglia (hnDAM) signature, which we experimentally validated in 11 independent sample series. We demonstrate that the hnDAM signature is a statistically testable biomarker for conserved microglial activation in NDDs by: i) comparing to murine DAM-like signatures, ii) performing transcription factor analysis, and iii) modeling transcriptional reprogramming perturbations in iPSC-derived microglia. Taken together, this work broadens our understanding of glial activation across neuropathologies and reveals hnDAM as a putative therapeutic target that can be widely generalized to patients suffering from NDDs.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

E.", "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI is understanding how physical space is mapped into neural representations. While artificial neural networks can generate brain-like spatial representations, such as place and grid cells, their black-box nature makes it difficult to determine if these representations arise as general solutions or as artifacts of a chosen architecture, objective function, or training protocol. Critically, these models offer no guarantee that learned solutions for core navigational tasks, like path integration (updating position from self-motion), will generalize beyond their training data. To address these challenges, we introduce a first-principles framework based on an exponential map model. Instead of using deep networks or gradient optimization, the presented model uses generator matrices to map physical locations into neural representations through the matrix exponential, creating a transparent framework that allows us to identify several exact algebraic conditions underlying key properties of neural maps. We show that path invariance (ensuring location representations are independent of traversal route) is achieved if the generators commute, while translational invariance (maintaining consistent spatial relationships across locations) demands generators producing orthogonal transformations. We also show that preserving the metric of flat space requires the eigenvalues of the generator matrices to form sets of roots of unity. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed framework constructs diverse biologically relevant spatial tuning, including place cells, grid cells, and context-dependent remapping. The framework we propose thus offers a transparent, theoretically-grounded alternative to black-box models, revealing the exact conditions required for a coherent neural map of space.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

We screened 9,393 mutagenized chromosomes and recovered 59 mutations that suppress neurodegeneration induced by dNmant depletion, including the known pro-degenerative molecule dSarm, thereby validating our approach.

Yet the precise sites where antibodies engage A{beta} in the brain, and the mechanisms that drive A{beta} clearance, are not fully defined. Defining the A{beta} antibody engagement with A{beta} in brain is essential to understand how immunotherapy can be beneficial for AD. Methods: We administered the well-establsihed N-terminal A{beta} antibody 6E10 via intrahippocampal (IH), cisterna magna (CM), or intraperitoneal (IP) injection in AD mouse models. N-terminal A{beta} antibodies were seen as most effective in AD mouse models. Antibody 6E10 was not only assessed in A{beta} plaques, but also examined in association with diverse brain cells and vascular compartments. Glymphatic dynamics were evaluated following A{beta} antibody treatment. Results: As expected, A{beta} antibody 6E10 bound to A{beta} plaques but remarkably also localized to vulnerable neurons, such as hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, as well as microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, perivascular macrophages (PVMs), and blood vessels. Glymphatic function showed no significant alterations after antibody administration.

Concomitant with that, the metrics of the saccades that do happen near the time of saccadic inhibition reflect the landscape of stimulus-driven neural responses in topographically organized brain maps. While certain aspects of saccadic inhibition have already been explored from a neurophysiological perspective, several questions remain, including which sensory-motor pathways propagate visual input information to the final oculomotor control circuitry with such short latencies. Here, motivated by evidence of a dissociation between temporal and spatial aspects of saccadic inhibition, we devised behavioral paradigms experimentally manipulating either aspect. Rhesus macaque monkeys maintained gaze fixation, and we characterized visually-driven microsaccadic inhibition with and without paired auditory pulses. In one condition, the sound pulses were spatially-unbiased, thus only affecting the temporal processes associated with microsaccadic inhibition; in another, the pulses were spatially-biased, affecting both the temporal and spatial components. We found that sound pulses alone barely affected microsaccade rates. However, when paired with visual stimuli, they accelerated the timing of visually-driven microsaccadic inhibition by ~14-18 ms. In terms of microsaccade directions, spatially-unbiased sounds interfered with, but did not eliminate, visually-driven direction modulations. Surprisingly, spatially-biased sounds had a much weaker effect on microsaccade direction modulations, even when the sound source was in the opposite hemifield as the appearing visual stimulus. We conclude that vision dominates sound in mediating classic microsaccadic inhibition, and we argue that our paradigms are ideal for neurophysiological investigations of the parallel sensory-motor pathways contributing to such inhibition.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Adopting a neurophenomenological stance, we combine first-person phenomenology with formal whole-brain modeling to ask what mechanisms underlie MPE states and the progression towards it, as reached through jh[a]na meditation, a type of advanced concentrative absorption meditation (ACAM-J). We used a dataset of advanced practitioners performing the eight ACAM-J states scanned in high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging. For each state, we build a mechanistic whole-brain model that reproduces brain activity by modeling the dynamical regimes of different resting-state networks. We found that the later ACAM-J states, taken here as candidates for MPE, show a shift of functional network dynamics toward near-bifurcation working points. The default mode network exhibits the largest shift, from a distant noise-driven regime at a control condition to near-critical dynamics. We also observed that the pathway to MPE is non-linear, with prominent reconfigurations at key meditative milestones. Our results suggest that MPE corresponds to a globally susceptible state where near-critical dynamics dominate. We interpret this critical regime as a form of \"openness\", where the usual hierarchical and heterogeneous patterns of brain activity give way to generalized flexibility. In this light, MPE provides both a minimal model of consciousness and a window into how advanced meditation can profoundly reshape brain dynamics.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Genome editing targeting the mutant RHO allele, leaving a functional wildtype (WT) allele, is an attractive approach for P23H adRP, as only one copy of RHO is needed for normal retinal function.

Rod rescue maintains cones. A year after RHO1-2 treatment, we show that TgP23H pigs use rod-driven vision to navigate a maze.

GSEA identified activated apoptosis pathways, with intrinsic (mitochondrial) and extrinsic (death receptor TNFR-mediated) apoptosis genes significantly upregulated (p<0.05). Uterine transcriptome analysis revealed downregulated collagen family genes (ECM maintenance) but upregulated immune-related genes (IL family, CDs, C3) in Group A.

A longstanding question is whether the CE contains transcriptionally distinct, spatially organized progenitor subpopulations with predetermined lineage biases, or whether specification into supporting and steroidogenic lineages occurs only after delamination and integration into the bipotential gonad. The developmental origins of granulosa cells and the emergence of ovarian steroidogenic/stromal progenitors (SPs) also remain poorly defined. Here, we show that CE cells covering the fetal mouse ovary are transcriptionally heterogeneous and spatially organized into subdomains already primed toward supporting or steroidogenic fates. CE priming is dynamic, with transient coexistence of supporting- and steroidogenic-biased CE progenitors before resolving into a predominantly supporting-biased CE. Local delamination of these primed cells seeds intragonadal niches where pre-granulosa cells and SPs mirror the spatio-temporal arrangements of CE-primed progenitors. We further demonstrate a dual origin for the supporting lineage, with granulosa cells deriving from both the CE and supporting-like cells (SLCs). In parallel, we show that SPs arise from steroidogenic-primed CE cells, expand to represent 52% of ovarian somatic cells at birth, persist into adulthood and contribute to both theca and steroidogenic stromal cells.

Through a series of laboratory trials, we assessed the interactions of paired blue and green crabs sourced from the GoM, specifically investigating the effects of crab size, aggression, and availability of alternative prey on these interactions. Blue crabs were found to be effective predators of green crabs, killing them in half of trials. Blue crabs were more likely to kill smaller green crabs (< 65 mm carapace width), and small to mid-size blue crabs (< 170 mm carapace width) were more likely than large blue crabs to consume green crabs. There was no green crab predation on blue crabs, though larger green crabs (> 65 mm carapace width) displayed more aggressive behavior towards blue crabs. Presence of an alternative prey item had no effect on blue crab predation on green crabs.

Continuum mechanics-based modeling was developed to formulate and calculate the chemical potential gradients of water (solvent) in the hydrogels under compression. This framework was extended into an advection-diffusion framework to quantify growth factor (solute) distribution under varying strengths of stress and diffusion indexed by the relative strength of convective to diffusive transport, characterized by the P&eacuteclet number.

Here, we focus on the RNA-binding protein Poly-C binding protein 1 (PCBP1), which binds target RNAs through K-homology (KH) domains to regulate RNA fate. PCBP1 is a tumor suppressor gene and hotspot missense mutations at leucine residues 100 and 102 are observed in colorectal cancer (CRC). PCBP1 mutations have been recurrently reported in CRC genome-wide mutation studies and are associated with poor clinical outcomes; however, their effects on PCBP1 expression and function remain largely unexplored. We show that cancer-associated mutations substituting leucine 100 and 102 with glutamine, proline, or arginine destabilize PCBP1, leading to increased protein turnover. The L100/L102 residues occur at the interface of the RNA-binding KH1 and KH2 domains, and our molecular dynamics simulations show that mutations at these residues disrupt the secondary structure of PCBP1.

Importantly, mutant PCBP1 physically interacts with wild type PCBP1 and suppresses its expression through a dominant-negative mechanism.

Mice with a whole-body deletion of Tlr4 developed MASH with steatosis, hepatocellular injury and inflammation; however, Tlr4 deletion prevented the deposition of fibrosis. Tlr4 deletion on immune cells or in hepatocytes did not prevent fibrosis. These results suggest that activation of TLR4 in other hepatic cells, possibly hepatic stellate cells, or in a combination of cells promotes liver fibrosis in MASLD.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

H.; Koganti, P. P.; Qian, M.; Garcia, A.; O'Day, P.; Auchus, R. J.; Covey, D. F.; Selvaraj, V.", "abstract": "The mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO) was once proposed to mediate mitochondrial cholesterol import for steroid hormone biosynthesis, but genetic deletion studies in multiple models have refuted this role. Nevertheless, the idea that pharmacological ligands of TSPO can modulate steroid output continues to be invoked. One such compound, 19-Atriol (androst-5-ene-3{beta},17{beta},19-triol), was reported to inhibit progesterone synthesis via TSPO binding in MA-10 Leydig cells. To evaluate this proposed mechanism, we used CRISPR/Cas9-generated Tspo-deleted MA-10 cells to study 19-Atriol activity. We found that 19-Atriol inhibited Bt2-cAMP-stimulated steroid output independent of TSPO expression; it acted as a competitive inhibitor of 3{beta}-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B), blocking the conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone. Mass spectrometry revealed that 19-Atriol is also a substrate for HSD3B, yielding 19-hydroxytestosterone (19-OHT), which itself inhibits HSD3B activity. In addition to this effect, both 19-Atriol and 19-OHT decreased cholesterol-to-pregnenolone conversion during stimulation. Partial inhibition of 22R-hydroxycholesterol metabolism by CYP11A1 was observed with 19-Atriol, but not 19-OHT, suggesting direct or indirect effects on this upstream step, potentially involving the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR). These findings decisively exclude TSPO as a functional mediator of 19-Atriol activity and instead identify direct enzymatic targets within the de novo steroidogenic pathway. By resolving a key mechanistic misattribution, this study underscores the importance of rigorous target validation, particularly for compounds previously assumed to act via TSPO.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

The acoustic pathway uses a long-short term memory (LSTM) decoder and a high-fidelity generative adversarial network (HiFi-GAN) to reconstruct spectrotemporal features. The linguistic pathway employs a transformer adaptor and text-to-speech (TTS) generator for word tokens. These two pathways merge via voice cloning to combine both acoustic and linguistic validity.

F.; Brundin, P.; Brundin, L.", "abstract": "Background Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a highly transmissible RNA betacoronavirus, causing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can result in a broad spectrum of clinical outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic or mild to a severe, deadly illness. Emerging evidence suggests SARS-CoV-2 affects host gene regulation through epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, potentially contributing to immune dysregulation and post-acute sequelae, including neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, the extent and functional relevance of these epigenetic changes remain uncertain. Methods and results We employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to profile DNA methylation in peripheral blood from SARS-CoV-2-positive patients across a spectrum of symptom severity, ranging from asymptomatic to severe (n=101), in comparison to SARS-CoV-2-negative individuals (n=105). We observed a widespread hypomethylation in the genomes of infected individuals, which was more pronounced in severe cases. Notably, we identified differentially methylated genes in patients with mild (19 genes), moderate (19 genes), and severe (35 genes) symptoms. These genes included those involved in canonical immune responses as well as known to be linked to neurodegenerative diseases. Subsequent pathway enrichment analysis further supported the significant association between the differentially methylated genes and those implicated in Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, as well as neuropsychiatric conditions, suggesting potential epigenetic links between acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and long-term neurological outcomes. This is one of the first studies to comprehensively map severity-stratified genome-wide DNA methylation changes in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion Our findings underscore the potential importance of epigenetic regulation in the acute responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight an overlap with epigenetic mechanisms relevant for neuropsychiatric disease processes.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

The naked mole-rat TrpM8 gene harbors a unique upstream exon that when translated produces a TRPM8 protein with a 71 amino acid N-terminal extension. When expressed, the N-terminal extension prevents membrane targeting and abolishes TRPM8 function. Splice forms lacking the extension formed functional cold and menthol activated channels in vivo. Additionally, many naked mole-rat sensory neurons use a TRPM8-independent mechanism to detect cold.

In this study, we show that stimulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) triggers calcium influx, leading to activation of calpain 1 and subsequent proteolytic cleavage of Ras-GTPase-activating protein binding protein 1 (G3BP1), a core component of stress granules. This cleavage results in the disassembly of G3BP1 granules in the neurites and promotes mTOR-dependent local translation, thereby linking synaptic activity to spatially restricted protein synthesis.

On the macroscopic level the engrams are not static either: numbers of engram neurons in different brain regions change over time, which is considered to reflect the process of memory consolidation. Here we predict a link between these two levels, using a novel statistical physics approach to engram modeling. Importantly, it is general as it makes only minimal assumptions on the engram's nature, does not rely on a specific architecture, and its fundamental implications hold for any representational drift with random component. Our first, analytically well tractable model shows that an entropic force emerges at the region level from random representational drift at the neuronal level. We refine the model by incorporating the interaction of the entropic force with biological processes that shape neuronal engrams. Here, the connectivity between the brain regions strongly influences the (quasi-)equilibrium engram distribution. The obtained distributions are in qualitative agreement with the ones of a biologically detailed drifting assembly model. Our engram description allows to predict the engram evolution in large neuronal systems such as the mouse brain. We find several predictions that are consistent across the valid tested parameter ranges, such as a strong tendency of the engram to leave the hippocampus. The results suggest that the brain operates in a regime where engrams drift, both deterministically and randomly, to allow for memory consolidation.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

The posterior insular cortex (pInsCx) contains representations of internal states and sensory cues, amongst them auditory stimuli. Nevertheless, the possibility of plastic encoding of auditory responses in the pInsCx during fear learning, and its underlying synaptic mechanisms have not been addressed. Using single-unit recordings in the pInsCx of male mice during fear learning, we find that ~ 10% of putative principal neurons acquire a response to an auditory CS during fear learning (\"CS learners\"). CS learners are enriched in the insula auditory field (IAF) of the dorsal pInsCx, and strongly overlap with a larger neuronal subpopulation which increases its activity during movement initiation. Using optogenetic circuit mapping, we find that the IAF receives glutamatergic synapses from the non-lemniscal auditory thalamus and the auditory cortex (A1); fear learning induces a postsynaptic form of LTP at the cortical, but not at the thalamic input synapse. Combined single-unit recordings and optogenetic axon silencing showed that the acquired CS-response during fear recall depends on transmission at the A1 [-&gt;] pInsCx synapse. Our study shows that the pInsCx generates a plastic representation of an auditory CS during fear learning, driven by LTP of an associative cortical input. Future work should further investigate how the integration of CS- and movement information in the insula contributes to the expression of auditory-cued fear memories.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Lentiviral expression of ORF7a in human lung epithelial (A549) and monocytic (THP1) cells, coupled with integrated transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses, revealed profound dysregulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. ORF7a impaired oxidative phosphorylation, reducing basal and maximal respiration, inducing mitochondrial depolarization, and increasing reactive oxygen species.

Differential gene expression analysis revealed that the expression of the FASII gene cluster is influenced by temperature, pH, carbon to nitrogen ratio, and the addition of free fatty acids, although these effects were not always uniform across the operon. The variability observed may be due to internal transcriptional start sites within the operon, indicating a complex regulatory mechanism. Additionally, we identified and characterised three lipid-responsive regulators, MabR RO, FadR1RO, and FadR2RO, which bind to the fasII promoter in vitro.

We show that CBD, in the absence of ART, suppresses viral replication and establishment of the viral reservoir to levels comparable with first-line therapies during acute SIV infection of rhesus macaques. This antiviral effect of CBD extended to in vitro HIV infection of human macrophages, T cells, and microglia. Immunologically, we observe CBD slowed CD4+ T cell decline and polarization, decreased CD14+CD16+ monocyte expansion, and reduced interferon-inducible cytokine release in rhesus macaques.

We show that this system accurately discriminates and tracks cells in G1, S, G2, and M phases both in vitro and in vivo, enabling faithful visualisation of cell cycle status in intact tissues and organs. Using FuChi embryos, we mapped proliferation dynamics across developing tissues, analysed cell cycle states of migrating cells, and performed live imaging of early embryos. These latter experiments revealed that transition from S phase may be a key morphogenetic event during gastrulation as mesendoderm cells egress from the primitive streak to form embryonic structures including the prechordal plate. Pairing this advanced reporter with the intrinsic experimental advantages of the chicken embryo, positions FuChi as a premier in vivo system for studying cell-cycle kinetics in development, delivering clear technological improvements over current Fucci models. FuChi chickens provide a powerful new resource for studying embryonic development, organ growth, tissue homeostasis, disease processes, and infection responses.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Studying decline is unavoidably a retrospective exercise in which researchers are challenged to determine whether trait values that are associated with dieback are drivers versus consquences of decline. In this study, we use the subalpine snow gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora, ssp niphophila) as a case study to illustrate how to identify whether plant traits may explain vulnerability of individual trees, assess how progression of dieback symptoms affect traits and physiological tolerance, and ask whether those changes could exacerbate decline. While the impact of drought on tree mortality has been well documented, we consider the potential role of heat which has received considerably less attention. We assessed changes in leaf and stem morphology, and stomatal anatomy across a dieback severity and an abiotic elevation gradient. We also assessed the relationship between these traits, photosystem heat tolerance and dieback progression, using results to model leaf viability under current and future climate scenarios. While severely symptomatic trees exibited trait values indicating water stress, trees with low or moderate dieback were not different from unaffected ones. Thus the differences in severely affected trees are likely responses to water stress caused by woodborer girdling and provide no evidence of underlying trait difference driving vulnerability. Severely symptomatic trees, however, had lower photosystem heat tolerance and models indicated leaves were likely to accumulate lethal damage to photosystems within a growing season, thus contributing to a feedback cycle of decline even under current thermal regimes.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

C.; Sasani, T. A.; Warner, D.; Neklason, D. W.; Quinlan, A. R.", "abstract": "Background: Short tandem repeats (STRs) and homopolymers are among the most mutable loci in the human genome. Despite their presumed mutability owing to replication slippage, homopolymer loci exhibit lower mutation rates and minimal paternal age effects compared to other STRs. This paradox questions if technical limitations, rather than biological mechanisms, explain these observations. Results: We used the Element Biosciences AVITI platform to sequence the genomes of a 48-member, four-generation CEPH/Utah pedigree. As the AVITI platform reduces error rates at repetitive sequences compared to Illumina, this design enabled accurate mutation discovery at 90% of assayed homopolymers and a 1.7-fold increase in discoverable mutations compared to Illumina. We identified a median of 35 de novo homopolymer mutations per trio and a mutation rate of 5.28 x 10-5 DNMs per locus per generation, confirming a lower rate than dinucleotides (1.94 x 10-4). Most DNMs were single base-pair expansions or contractions. Despite comprising <1% of homopolymer loci, G/C homopolymers showed 18-fold higher mutation rates than A/T homopolymers; in contrast, the high dinucleotide mutation rate is not driven by a particular motif class. Parent-of-origin analysis revealed 78% of homopolymer mutations are paternal in origin, but no significant paternal age effect was observed. Conclusions: This study confirms that homopolymers exhibit lower mutation rates and lack strong paternal age effects compared to other STRs, likely owing to the combination of a lower propensity to form slippage-causing secondary structures and more efficient mismatch repair. Our set of high-quality mutations suggest these phenomena are biological rather than technical in nature. Finally, we demonstrate that AVITI sequencing unlocks previously intractable regions of the genome and will be a powerful tool for continued investigation of repeat mutation.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have shown that familiarity strongly influences rat social behavior, and that rats can be trained to discriminate between olfactory cues from cage-mates and non-cage-mates in a digging task. However, such discrimination did not occur in a lever-pressing task using live conspecifics as stimuli. In the present study, we investigated whether rats could discriminate social familiarity in a simple, less-demanding and naturalistic context using whole-animal stimuli. We employed a habituation-dishabituation paradigm in which multiple cage-mate or non-cage-mate individuals were presented during the habituation phase. We examined whether rats would habituate to the familiarity category among these multiple stimuli and subsequently show dishabituation when the stimulus class switched (cage-mate to non-cage-mate or vice versa). During the habituation phase, exploratory responses declined over successive sessions, suggesting habituation to the common element among multiple cage-mates or non-cage-mates, i.e., familiarity/unfamiliarity. When data from all subjects were combined, clear dishabituation to the stimulus class switch was not observed. However, post-hoc analysis restricted to subjects showing sufficient habituation revealed significant dishabituation. These findings suggest that rats can spontaneously classify multiple conspecifics according to their familiarity without training. Rats may flexibly employ different forms of social recognition and information such as individual identity or familiarity-based heuristics to guide adaptive social behavior in varying contexts.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

PRC2 catalyzes tri-methylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), which is targeted for chromatin compaction by PRC1. Importantly, PRC2-associated cofactors regulate its distinct activities, as in the case of MTF2 and JARID2 that direct PRC2 to specific chromatin nucleation sites based on preferred DNA-binding motifs. Here, we investigated EPOP whose role in regulating PRC2 was not well-defined. We find that both EPOP and MTF2 stimulate PRC2 histone methyltransferase (HMT) activity in vitro. Unlike MTF2, EPOP is ineffectual in PRC2 chromatin recruitment as evidenced by an EED-rescue system in vivo, but promotes H3K27me3 deposition de novo in cooperation with MTF2 and JARID2. Binding assays using reconstituted dinucleosome substrates revealed that similar to MTF2, EPOP promotes PRC2 chromatin-binding activity in a distinct DNA-sequence dependent manner (GCN-rich and GA-rich, respectively).

K.; Gosavi, S.", "abstract": "The viral envelope-resident viral fusion proteins (VFPs) fuse the envelope with the host cell membrane, which allows virus entry into host cells. The homotrimeric class I VFPs (cI-VFPs) are anchored to the envelope by three single-pass transmembrane helices (spTMHs). It is generally accepted that the hydrophobic length of a TMH matches the thickness of the hydrophobic membrane core, and this reduces TMH dynamics by stabilizing both the TMHs and the membrane. However, to enable fusion, a cI-VFP undergoes a large conformational transition which includes the disassembly of the spTMHs from a pre-fusion trimer and their subsequent reassembly with the cI-VFP fusion peptides into a post-fusion complex. Given the potential functional relevance of the cI-VFP spTMH disassembly-reassembly dynamics, we hypothesized that these spTMH lengths may be mismatched with the thickness of biological membranes. Here, we examine the predicted lengths of a curated dataset of cI-VFP spTMHs and find that they are indeed about 10% longer than the hydrophobic thickness of model membranes. The cI-VFP spTMHs are on average also longer than the spTMHs of human fusion and human non-fusion proteins. Since our dataset contains cI-VFPs from diverse enveloped viruses, and viral proteins are fast evolving, we conclude that the longer spTMHs are functionally relevant and thus, preserved. Our observation that the spTMH lengths of retrovirus-derived human fusogenic proteins, syncytins, are similar to those of cI-VFPs, supports this conclusion. The longer spTMHs may facilitate the cI-VFP conformational change and perturb the fusing membrane, reducing the barrier to fusion.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

An optimization framework then identifies the top ten most parsimonious (i.e., fewest steps) mechanistic descriptions for the overall transformation, which are then re-ranked based on their mechanistic similarity to a database of known, curated mechanisms. MechFind recovered the correct mechanism for 72% of the Mechanism and Catalytic Site Atlas (M-CSA) training dataset within the top ten predictions and was independently validated on six enzyme mechanisms absent from the training set. When deployed at scale on 28,412 reactions from the Rhea database, MechFind identified a plausible mechanism for 64% of all entries, generating over 18,000 novel mechanistic hypotheses expanding significantly upon the current state of the art in prediction (i.e., a 20-fold increase).

However, its application is fundamentally limited to the comparison of structures with a pre-defined, one-to-one correspondence of equal length, precluding its direct use for the vast majority of biologically relevant comparisons involving proteins of different lengths or unknown equivalences. To overcome this limitation, we introduce OT-RMSD, a novel, parameter-light method that generalizes the RMSD for comparing unequal-length protein structures without a pre-defined alignment. Our approach recasts the correspondence problem as an Optimal Transport (OT) task, utilizing a fundamental, distance-based cost function to identify the most economical mapping between two protein structures. This transport plan is then used as a soft-weighting scheme within an iterative Sinkhorn-Kabsch framework to simultaneously solve for correspondence and optimal superposition. We test our method on a benchmark dataset of 40 challenging protein pairs and demonstrate its superiority over both the widely-used PyMOL 'align' command and a more complex, heuristic-driven variant of our own framework. On average, OT-RMSD identifies larger and more accurate alignment cores, achieving a significantly lowerRMSD. We conclude that OT-RMSD provides a mathematically principled, robust, and effective extension of the classic RMSD concept, offering a powerful tool for modern structural analysis.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

We designed pairs of DNA constructs with reversed stacking polarities at nick sites, along with corresponding no-stack controls to isolate stacking contributions. Performing single-molecule force-clamp assays with a Centrifuge Force Microscope (CFM), we observed polarity-dependent differences in stacking energetics. These differences were most pronounced in purine-purine and certain purine-pyrimidine interactions. Notably, a 5' purine stacked on a 3' pyrimidine was generally more stable than the reverse polarity. We employed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to observe stacking interfaces in the DNA constructs. The simulations were qualitatively consistent with our experiments, and showed positional differences between opposite polarity stacking pairs, giving some insight into the origin of these polarity differences. Overall, these results demonstrate that base polarity can modulate stacking stability and should be considered when designing short duplex regions such as overhangs in molecular biology and biotechnology applications.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Previous simulation studies have shown that early treatment initiation is critical to maximize the therapeutic response in antiviral treatment in an acute viral infection such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2. A recent experimental study demonstrated that late therapy initiation can lead to diminished antiviral potency. However, most VD model simulations with varying treatment initiation time accounted only for the effect of initiation condition (i.e., state of different cell populations when the therapy started), the loss of drug potency has been under-investigated. This may overestimate the antiviral effect, potentially resulting in suboptimal dose selection. To this end, we aimed to characterize relationship between the drug potency (EC50) and the timing of drug addition, using nirmatrelvir and GS-441524 against SARS-CoV-2 as an example. Viral load data were obtained from in vitro experiments with various drug concentrations and treatment initiated between 0 to 3 days post infection. EC50 values were fitted for each treatment initiation group and were found to vary with the timing of treatment initiation in both drugs. Also, a VD model with time-varying EC50 provided better fits than a constant EC50 model (BIC = 1667.90 vs. 1677.84). Further simulations also indicated that a constant EC50 model overestimated the antiviral efficacy when treatment started late. These findings highlighted the importance of considering EC50 shift when optimizing dosage regimens for patients presenting late.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

We named the protein YloB based on homology to the Bacillus subtilis protein. Structural modeling confirmed that YloB possesses the conserved domains and motifs typical of calcium binding P-type ATPases. Deletion of yloB did not affect growth under elevated calcium levels nor did it reduce MICP yields, indicating that YloB is dispensable for calcium detoxification and biomineralization. In contrast, {triangleup}yloB cells produced only partially dehydrated spores with severely reduced heat resistance, a defect rescued by complementation. A YloB-mNeonGreen fluorescent fusion localized specifically to the cell membrane surrounding the forespore during early engulfment, and was retained at this site throughout the remainder of sporulation. A transcriptional PyloB-msfGFP reporter demonstrated that yloB transcription was induced in the early stages of sporulation, but did not respond to a calcium stimulus.

Using AHR reporter, CYP1A1 mRNA induction, CYP1A enzyme assay, photoaffinity AHR-ligand competition, and in silico docking, we establish that these metabolites are bona fide agonists of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), with FTIN being the most potent AHR ligand (EC50 ~41 nM in HepG2 cells). Genetic and pharmacological perturbations demonstrate that FTIN-activated AHR promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion in EGFR blockade-responsive CRC cell lines, such as SNU-C4, but not in EGFR blockade-resistant cell lines, such as HCT116. We show that FTIN-activated AHR signaling is critical for Fn-mediated promotion of CRC cell growth. A {Delta}tnaA mutant defective in indole production lacked FTIN/STIN/TIN production and was unable to activate AHR or enhance CRC cell growth in vitro and SNU-C4 xenograft growth in vivo. RNA-seq and follow-up functional validation identified TERT as a key downstream effector of FTIN-activated AHR signaling. FTIN upregulated TERT transcription and telomerase activity, and TERT knockdown abrogated FTIN-promoted CRC cell proliferation. FTIN production was conserved across Fn subspecies, as well as other Fusobacterium species, and detected in additional CRC-associated genera.

A major challenge in AMP research is distinguishing AMP effects resulting from various protein interactions from those caused by membrane disruption. Moreover, since AMPs often act in multiple cellular compartments, it is challenging to pinpoint where their distinct activities occur. Nodule-specific cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides secreted by legumes, including NCR247, have evolved from AMPs to regulate differentiation of their nitrogen-fixing bacterial partner during symbiosis as well as to exert antimicrobial actions. At sub-lethal concentrations, NCR247 exhibits strikingly pleiotropic effects on Sinorhizobium meliloti. We used the L- and D-enantiomeric forms of NCR247 to distinguish between phenotypes resulting from stereospecific, protein-targeted interactions and those caused by achiral interactions such as membrane disruption. In addition, we utilized an S. meliloti strain lacking BacA, the transporter that imports NCR peptides into the cytoplasm. BacA plays critical symbiotic roles by reducing periplasmic peptide accumulation and fine-tuning symbiotic signaling. Use of the BacA-deficient strain made it possible to distinguish between phenotypes resulting from peptide interactions in the periplasm and those occurring in the cytoplasm. At high concentrations, both L- and D-NCR247 permeabilize bacterial membranes, consistent with nonspecific cationic AMP activity. In the cytoplasm, both NCR247 enantiomers sequester heme and trigger iron starvation in an achiral but BacA-dependent manner. However, only L-NCR247 activates bacterial two-component systems via stereospecific periplasmic interactions. By combining stereochemistry and genetics, this work disentangles the spatial and molecular complexity of NCR247 action.

K.; Zeelen, J. P.; Buscher, P.; Lejon, V.; Mugnier, M. R.", "abstract": "Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) is a severe disease endemic to Sub-Saharan Africa caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. Trypanosoma brucei parasites rely on the antigenic variation of their variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) to evade host antibody recognition, and diagnosis of the chronic form of HAT relies heavily on serological screening tests that detect specific antibodies. Despite the biological and clinical significance of anti-VSG antibodies, studies of the antibody response to VSG have been limited by low-throughput approaches that allow for the analysis of only a few VSG proteins at a time, primarily in animal models, leading to a fragmented understanding of how antibody targets VSG in HAT. Here, we use phage immunoprecipitation sequencing (PhIP-seq) to comprehensively characterize the antibody response to VSG in HAT patient serum. Using a T7 bacteriophage display library containing peptides representing 12,108 unique T. brucei VSGs, our analysis revealed significant differences in the anti-VSG antibody response between the acute and chronic forms of HAT. Our results show that, in chronic HAT, the top lobe of the VSG is the primary interface of antibody interactions. By characterizing the targets of anti-VSG immunity, we also identified a potential bias in the CATT, the most common serological test used for HAT screening. Finally, we were able to identify sets of seroprevalent VSG peptides for each form of the disease that successfully distinguish between infected and uninfected individuals. Our results demonstrate the utility of characterizing host antibody responses against African trypanosomes, which can reveal unique features of parasite biology while also uncovering new diagnostic targets.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Genome editing showed that the N3-DRE is essential for Cdk1 repression in mouse PGCs in vivo. A 1.7-[A] crystal structure of the ternary complex of DND1, NANOS3, and CDK1-N3-DRE RNA revealed a continuous RNA-binding surface that confers high-affinity, sequence-specific recognition. Together, these findings define the molecular and functional basis of N3-DRE-mediated mRNA regulation in germ cell development. Moreover, we provide a paradigm of two RNA-binding proteins with low (DND1) or no (NANOS3) intrinsic sequence-specificity, jointly building a high-information-content RNA sequence motif that is different from the sum of their individual preferences.

Surprisingly, the level of tRNALys(UUU) is strongly increased rather than reduced in the ctu1 or ctu2 mutant backgrounds that prevent these modifications. This suggests the existence of a regulatory feedback loop that drives the transcription of this specific tRNA gene family.

Leveraging the genomic resources of Arabidopsis thaliana, we created experimental synthetic populations of similar genetic diversity but differing genetic makeups by mixing 245 natural accessions with different levels of potentially-climate-adaptive alleles and/or genomic burden of deleterious mutations. We planted our populations in a climate change field experiment simulating a gradient of declining rainfall. By tracking survival and reproduction of 135 synthetic experimental populations over three years, we show substantial predictability of genetic makeup on survival and population growth rate. Further, the accumulation of deleterious mutations and locally (mal)adaptive alleles synergistically reduces fitness in increasingly stressful climates. Our findings underscore that for populations to have the greatest chance of surviving climate change, the optimal combination of genomic makeups is essential.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

We characterize thermal environments over the resurvey periods, which we interface with developmental and (historical, current, and hypothetical) thermal sensitivity traits to examine the implications of evolutionary changes. We find that the evolution of photoperiod-cued plasticity of wing melanization in California Colias is consistent with avoiding thermal stress during warming springs. Plasticity has not evolved for Colorado Colias populations, which have experienced stronger increases in climate means relative to extremes in recent decades. Evolution in Colorado Colias larvae has improved tolerance to warm extremes, whereas evolution in California Colias larvae has broadened thermal sensitivity consistent with capitalizing on expanded seasonal thermal opportunity.

Whilst there are known K. pneumoniae ciprofloxacin resistance determinants, there is a lack of systematic data on the effect of determinants, alone and in combination, and there are no publicly accessible tools for predicting resistance from whole genome sequence data. METHODS The KlebNET-GSP AMR Genotype-Phenotype Group aggregated a matched genotype-phenotype dataset of n=12,167 K. pneumoniae species complex (KpSC) isolates from 27 countries between 2001-2021. We developed a rules-based classifier to predict ciprofloxacin resistance by categorizing the number of quinolone resistance determining regions mutations in gyrA and parC, the number of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes, and the presence/absence of aac(6')-Ib-cr (which can acetylate ciprofloxacin). Predictive performance was assessed using the discovery dataset, for which we re-phenotyped discrepant isolates; and validated using externally contributed datasets (n=7,030 KpSC isolates). RESULTS The rules-based classifier predicted R vs S/I with categorical agreement, sensitivity, and specificity >96%, and major/very major error rates <4%. Performance was similar across diverse KpSC sources (human, animal, other), species, and intra-species lineages. External validation of the classifier yielded overall 93.12% categorical agreement [95% confidence interval (CI), 92.50-93.74%], 8.65% major errors [95% CI, 7.34-9.97%], and 6.20% very major errors [95% CI, 5.51-6.90%]. We implemented the classifier in Kleborate, a command-line tool that is integrated into the Pathogenwatch web platform. Using this to assess the global distribution of ciprofloxacin resistance determinants in KpSC genomes available in Pathogenwatch (n=31,319, from 109 countries between years 2000-2023), we observed a significant positive association between national quinolone consumption rates and predicted ciprofloxacin resistance (R2=0.20, p=0.004). CONCLUSIONS Ciprofloxacin resistance phenotypes can be reasonably predicted from genotypes, which is sufficient for informing surveillance. However, unexplained resistance remains and accuracy is insufficient for clinical applications. We demonstrate the value of aggregating genotype-phenotype data to explore resistance mechanisms and develop predictors, but highlight complexities in combining phenotype data from different assays and standards.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Unlike Wnt ligands, Norrin requires the tetraspanin Tspan12 for signaling amplification, but it is not understood why. Here, we report a 3.4-angstrom structure of Tspan12 in complex with FZD4 determined by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals that FZD4 and Tspan12 form a direct complex in the absence of Norrin, with a contact interface between the lower hinge of FZD4 and the extracellular loops of Tspan12 that enables FZD4 to respond with a more gradual response to a wider range of Norrin concentrations. The transmembrane (TM) domain of Tspan12 is oriented in a tightly packed four-helix bundle and interacts with TM2 of FZD4 to promote trafficking of Tspan12 to the cell surface. The C-D helices of Tspan12, which mediate binding to Norrin, remain exposed while Tspan12 is in complex with FZD4, facilitating higher-affinity Norrin binding. Cell-based assays reveal that Tspan12 and FZD4 remain associated after Norrin recognition, indicating that Tspan12 is a core component of the FZD4-Norrin-LRP5/6 signaling complex. Together, these studies reveal the molecular mechanism underlying Tspan12-FZD4 complex assembly and enhancement of Norrin signaling and suggest new ways to target the FZD4-Tspan12 complex for ocular diseases of hypo- or hyper-vascularization.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Elevated ALK activity, independent of mutational status leads to increased migration velocity and loss of directionality, while ALKF1174L overexpression presents additional effects on cytoskeletal protrusions. These results correlate with increased binding of ALKF1174L to GSK3, which has previously been shown to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics in neural crest cells.

Mechanotransduction feedback loops convert mechanical forces into gene-expression changes that, in turn, regulate cell behaviors such as growth and extracellular matrix (ECM) production. How these loops are coupled to developmental programs to ensure robust morphogenetic outcomes remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Yap-dependent mechanotransduction establishes a self-limiting positive feedback loop that drives the successful formation of semicircular canals in zebrafish. These canals form through reproducible steps of bud initiation, extension, and fusion within the otic epithelium. Local swelling of a hyaluronan-rich ECM initiates bud formation. We demonstrate that this ECM expansion activates Yap in a spatially patterned manner within the bud. Activated Yap induces its target, ccn1l1, which drives further ECM production, establishing a positive feedback loop. The ensuing rapid ECM expansion sustains bud extension. Graded perturbations to the mechanotransduction loop reduced extension, with bud fusion remaining robust at lower levels of disruption but blocked at the highest dose. Critically, the loop contains its own termination mechanism: when buds fuse, the PKA-CREB signaling is activated by the adhesion GPCR Gpr126 to suppress ccn1l1, preventing overgrowth. These findings reveal how mechanotransduction-driven positive feedback loops can be coupled to their own termination, providing developmental control through the integration of mechanical forces with transcriptional responses and morphogenetic outcomes.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

Upon mixing, these dual-patterned hPSCs interacted and self-organized into elongated structures with both anterior and posterior features, which we term anterior-posterior (AP) human gastruloids. Anteriorly pre-treated cells robustly intercalated into posteriorly pre-treated cells, collectively giving rise to a continuum of neural tissues, including a brain-like domain, a neural tube-like structure, and neuro-mesodermal progenitors (NMPs) with segmented somites arrayed bilaterally. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) revealed that human AP gastruloids contain cell types resembling the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB), regionalized hindbrain structures (i.e. rhombomeres 1-8), regionalized neural crest (i.e. cranial, vagal, trunk) and head mesoderm. Transcriptomic comparisons to primate embryos revealed that human AP gastruloids most closely resemble Carnegie stage 11 (CS11) embryos. While they lack a notochord and full dorsal-ventral polarity, human AP gastruloids recapitulate key spatial and temporal features of early neurulation and somitogenesis. Perturbation of folic acid metabolism or rho-associated kinase (ROCK) signaling induced spinal cord defects, phenocopying aspects of spina bifida and other neural tube defects, highlighting the potential of this model for studying congenital disorders.

We validate our model with independent data by showing that biologically relevant binding events identified by our model are capable of recruiting RNA Polymerase II and, subsequently, regulating mRNA expression levels of the target gene. Finally, we investigate the impact of our approach on the detection of genes that are differentially bound and regulated by BCL3, a transcription coactivator, during molecular perturbation experiments. Within the genes expected to show differential expression, our model predicts that over 70% of reported interactions are spurious and we demonstrate the lack of change in mRNA expression in these genes following perturbation. We also identify genes that display a shift from spurious to biologically relevant binding that account for close to 17% of the genes displaying a sharp change in mRNA expression and strong association with known functions of BCL3 such as cell cycle regulation and DNA damage response. By providing a systematic TF-specific method to identify binding events that are directly involved in transcriptional regulation our model will increase reproducibility of analysis.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "The control of transcription factor (TF) concentrations is crucial for the precise regulation of gene expression and cell fate decisions during development. Yet, TF concentrations can display substantial temporal fluctuations and intercellular variations. How TF levels quantitatively shape genome-wide occupancy patterns remains largely unexplored. Here, we systematically investigate how physiological fluctuations in the concentrations of the pluripotency TFs OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG impact their genomic binding profiles in mouse embryonic stem cells. We uncover distinct concentration-dependent binding behaviors for each TF. NANOG occupancy increased monotonously with its concentration, even though a common set of regions made accessible by OCT4 and SOX2 are highly and uniformly bound at all NANOG concentrations. In contrast, SOX2 occupancy does not increase with its concentrations, while OCT4 displayed an intermediate behavior. Our results challenge the notion that TF binding follows simple mass-action dynamics and reveal a core set of pluripotency regions that are bound by all three TFs at all TF concentrations, revealing how pluripotency can be maintained despite marked fluctuations in core pluripotency TFs.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Subtelomeres are imperfect repeats adjacent to telomeres that are repressed by heterochromatin. Although essential for genome integrity, their repetitive nature has thwarted dissection of local heterochromatin assembly and maintenance mechanisms. Here, we engineered Schizosaccharomyces pombe strains carrying fluorescent reporters at a single subtelomere. We find that subtelomeric heterochromatin is organized into discrete subdomains that nucleate at telomere-proximal and cryptic internal sites. Telomere-proximal regions depend on canonical shelterin or RNA interference nucleation pathways, while telomere-distal regions require nucleosome remodelers, histone chaperones, and boundary-associated factors. Using multi-generational live imaging and targeted perturbations, we show that subtelomeric subdomains display position-specific, clonally variable silencing across a spectrum of robust to fragile epigenetic states. This clonal variegation is also induced by naturally occurring subtelomeric structural variants. These findings demonstrate that subtelomeric heterochromatin maintenance is not uniform but rather governed by local chromatin context and architecture.", "date": "2025-09-25", "journal": ""}
