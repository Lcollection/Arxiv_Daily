M.; Jiang, Z.; Kim, H. R.; Evans, P. C.; Wilkinson, R. N.", "abstract": "Nascent vascular networks adapt to the increasing metabolic demands of growing tissues by expanding via angiogenesis. As vascular networks expand, blood vessels remodel, progressively refining vascular connectivity to generate a more haemodynamically efficient network. This process is driven by interplay between endothelial cell (EC) signalling and blood flow. While much is known about angiogenesis, considerably less is understood of the mechanisms underlying vessel remodelling by blood flow. Here we employ the zebrafish sub-intestinal venous plexus (SIVP) to characterise the mechanisms underlying blood flow-dependent remodelling. Using live imaging to track ECs we show that blood flow controls SIVP remodelling by coordinating collective migration of ECs within the developing plexus. Blood flow opposes continuous ventral EC migration within the SIVP and is required for regression of angiogenic sprouts to support plexus growth. Sprout regression occurs by coordinated polarisation and migration of ECs from non-perfused leading sprouts, which migrate in opposition to blood flow and incorporate into the SIV. Sprout regression is compatible with low blood flow and is dependent upon vegfr3/flt4 function under these conditions. Blood flow limits expansive venous remodelling promoted by vegfr3/flt4. Collectively, these studies reveal how blood flow sculpts a developing vascular plexus by coordinating EC migration and balancing vascular remodelling via vegfr3/flt4", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Functional MRI revealed a 3-fold spatial periodicity in the hippocampal activity that tracked navigation directions from object variants to the central prototype. This hippocampal periodicity was phase-locked with the well-documented 6-fold periodicity of the entorhinal cortex, suggesting hierarchical interaction between these regions. Consistent with this neural pattern, a corresponding 3-fold periodicity was observed in behavioral performance, which was synchronized with hippocampal activity. Finally, an EC-HPC PhaseSync model reproduced this phenomenon, in which the 6-fold activity periodicity of entorhinal grid cells across directions projects vectorial representations to the hippocampus, and the collection of these vectors exhibits 3-fold periodicity to represent conceptual directions.

However, increased sociality also heightens the risk of harassment and disease. Animals would thus benefit from flexibly switching between social and solitary states in response to resource fluctuations. Whether wild animals do this strategically and successfully remains unclear. We experimentally studied groups of wild guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in a resource-poor environment to test if they adjust their social state after recent experience with relatively unpredictable and short-lived novel food patches. Using individually marked fish, we found that groups exposed to ephemeral food patches significantly increased their time spent social, doubling it, compared to control conditions. Groups with stronger foraging motivation showed greater increases in sociality, and individuals in such groups were more successful in locating food patches, thereby realising greater food intake. In a second field experiment, we show that wild guppy groups similarly increased sociality in response to food odours, suggesting strategic adjustments of sociality rather than mere satiation-driven changes in activity budgets. Our findings thus provide causal evidence that animals can be active engineers, rather than passive recipients, of social foraging benefits, highlighting the adaptive nature of fission-fusion dynamics.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Drift diffusion modeling was applied to accuracy and reaction time data to estimate changes in evidence accumulation (drift rate), decision threshold (boundary separation), and non-decision processes (ter). Results revealed improved post-exercise performance, characterized by shorter non-decision time, potentially reflecting a transient improvement in motor or perceptual efficiency.

In this study, we combined single-cell microencapsulation with confocal microscopy to develop a new experimental approach for analyzing budding yeast cell lineages and determining the age of every cell within each microcolony. We found that most slow-growing lineages are founded by young mother cells that have undergone only a few cell divisions, typically between 1 and 4. This reduction in proliferative capacity is linked to the expression levels of the cell cycle regulator Whi5, which increase with the number of replication cycles, even since the earliest stages. We also found that the increased levels of Whi5 are due to the higher accumulation of its mRNA during the S/G2/M phases of young mother cells compared to newborn cells. Our results show that the proliferative structure of a cell population is progressively shaped in each mitotic cycle, starting from the very first division, when a mother cell has the opportunity to establish a slow proliferating lineage.

Rtf1 is a multifunctional transcription regulatory protein involved in modulating promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II. Using zebrafish and mouse as model systems, we show that Rtf1 activity is essential for the differentiation of the myocardial lineage from mesoderm. Ablation of rtf1 impairs the formation of nkx2.5+/tbx5a+ cardiac progenitor cells, resulting in the development of embryos without cardiomyocytes. Structure-function analysis demonstrates that Rtf1's cardiogenic activity requires its Plus3 domain, which confers interaction with the pausing/elongation factor Spt5. In Rtf1-deficient embryos, the occupancy of RNA Pol II at transcription start sites was reduced relative to downstream occupancy, suggesting a reduction in transcriptional pausing. Intriguingly, attenuating pause release by pharmacological inhibition or morpholino targeting of CDK9 improved RNA polymerase II occupancy at the transcription start sites of key cardiac genes and restored cardiomyocytes in Rtf1-deficient embryos. Thus, our findings demonstrate the crucial role that Rtf1-mediated transcriptional pausing plays in controlling the precise spatio-temporal transcription programs that govern early heart development.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

We identified two genetic lineages at least 3 million years divergent, revealing cryptic diversity within the species. Our study indicates that the most common populations used for commercial and academic applications are primarily derived from just one of these lineages, likely originating from a wild North American progenitor. We find that captive populations show strong reductions in genetic diversity, consistent with genome-wide effects of population bottlenecks and drift associated with rearing in captivity. Some limited evidence of gene flow between divergent lineages was observed, as well as evidence of hybridisation from domesticated populations into the wild.

These behavioral adaptations are primarily driven by reinforcement learning, leading to structural and kinematic modifications of consolidated motor programs. While the motor cortex is recognized as a crucial neural substrate for adaptive motor control and skill learning, the mechanisms by which cortical microcircuits actively fine-tune the timing and structure of action sequences, enabling organisms to adaptively maintain motor efficiency across varying task demands, remain unclear. Here, we found that the calcium activity of somatostatin (SST) interneurons (INs) in the primary motor cortex (M1) exhibits highly action-locked and synchronized calcium responses during the acquisition of a single lever-press task in freely moving mice. This neural representation contrasts with the sequential activation of pyramidal (PYR) neurons during the same task. After extended training with a consistent schedule and subsequent motor consolidation, M1 SST IN activity was no longer related to action execution. However, when the training schedule was progressively updated, leading mice to adapt their motor programs for more time-constrained, rapid action sequences, the action-related SST IN activity redistributed and did not decrease. Notably, this redistributed calcium activity of M1 SST INs correlated with structural modulation of ongoing action sequences. We identified two distinct neural activity patterns among non-overlapping SST IN populations: one encoding the initiation of action sequences and the other encoding trial-by-trial structural changes during the execution of complex action sequences. Moreover, inhibition of SST INs disrupted temporal structure of action sequences and decreased the efficiency of motor program execution. These findings highlight the unexpected role of M1 SST interneurons in actively refining motor programs into more efficient and task-specific structures.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Studies have shown that infants, members of isolated Stone Age tribes, and non-human primates can readily identify objects from line drawings. These findings suggest that the brain may inherently generate neural representations that align across different rendering cues, enabling abstraction. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the representational invariance of complex patterns of surface boundaries found in natural scenes. We tested whether individual neurons in V1 and V2 of the macaque monkey responded similarly to the presentation of these patterns across different renderings (i.e., as contours, luminance-defined patches, and segments of natural images). We found that individual neurons exhibit some degree of tuning invariance, stronger in V1 than in V2. At the population level, as a means to assess cue-invariant abstract representation, we measured decoding accuracy across cues ('cue-transfer' decoding). We found that this decoding is greatly enhanced when a geometric transformation (Procrustes Transformation) is first performed to align the population activities across cues. It is also effective when applied to different populations of neurons within or across visual areas. These results were compared with populations of artificial neurons from models of the ventral visual streams, further indicating that cue-invariance stabilizes with population size. In summary, we found that while individual neurons exhibit some cue-invariance properties, the stability of the population geometry emerges as a more robust candidate for supporting a cue-invariant representation of visual information in the early visual areas.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Our results revealed a general transition of up-regulated A-to-I RNA editing activity across numerous tissue types during embryonic-adult development, indicated by significantly increased average RNA editing levels. Consistently, differential RNA editing (DRE) analysis showed more up-regulated than down-regulated RNA editing sites in all six tissue types. Furthermore, such RNA editing transitions during development could contribute to differential gene expression (DEG) at both transcriptional and translational levels, as well as differential alternative splicing (DAS) across multiple tissues. Differentially edited genes with DEG or DAS could be involved not only in tissue-specific biological functions but also in common routine biological processes during development. Notably, Adarb1 was found to be a more important player than Adar in the CNS (the brain and retina), with its expression levels increasing gradually and correlating with the A-to-I RNA editing activity.

This was associated with dysregulation of hepatically-metabolized molecules in the blood of these wild type mice with mutational ancestry.

In this contribution, we combine in toto experiments with three-dimensional image analysis, computational modeling, and theoretical tools to provide a quantitative characterization of the dynamics of growth and differentiation of the developing vertebrate retina. We show that the tissue develops by gradually increasing the average rate of differentiation and reducing the average cell cycle length. Moreover, this balance between differentiation with cell cycle duration increases the yield of production of terminally differentiated neurons, and it is required to achieve a well-defined exponential growth. We also show that a potential regulator of this balance is Hedgehog (Hh), promoting simultaneously cell cycle progression and cell cycle exit of RPCs.

To examine how such species may maintain adaptability, we studied inheritance in Varroa mites (Varroa destructor), a globally invasive honey bee parasite. Using three-generation pedigrees, we found that Varroa is not haplodiploid, as previously thought. Rather, females produce diploid sons who transmit either maternal allele to daughters. This system slows reduced heterozygosity loss under sib-mating, compared to ancestral haplodiploidy, increasing effective population size and adaptability.

We evaluated the effects of wolf lethal removals on the distribution of attack intensities in the French Alps between 2011 and 2020, using a Before After Control-Impact approach with retrospective data. We built an original framework combining both continuous spatial and temporal scales and a 3D kernel estimation. We compared the attack intensities observed before and after the legal killings of wolves on a period of 90 days and on a range of 10 km, and with control situations where no removal occurred. The analysis was corrected for the presence of livestock. A moderate decrease of attack intensity was the most common outcome after the lethal removal of a single wolf. This reduction was greatly amplified when removing two or three wolves. The scale of analysis also modulated this general pattern, with decreases being generally amplified at a small spatio-temporal range. Contextual factors (e.g., geographical or seasonal variations) could also lead to deviations from this general pattern. Overall, between 2011 and 2020, lethal control of wolves in France generally contributed to reduce livestock attacks, but mainly locally and to a minor extent. Our results highlight the importance of accounting for scale in such assessments and suggest that the evaluation of the effectiveness of lethal removals in reducing livestock predation might be more relevant in a local context.

While numerous RNAs are associated with germ granules in Drosophila, the functions of many in germline development are poorly understood. Current methods for RNA knockdown, such as RNAi, do not allow local depletion of transcripts such as those found in the germ granules. We leveraged CRISPR-Cas13 to create a subcellular RNA knockdown system and tested it on two mRNAs, nanos (nanos) and sarah (sra), whose abundance in germ granules differs. Because Cas13 has both cis and trans cleavage activities, we evaluated the effect of target abundance on off-target RNA depletion. We show on and off-target RNA depletion is coupled when targeting the more abundant nanos germ granule transcripts. Off-target RNA knockdown is less potent when the system is used for less abundant sra transcripts. When sra is knocked down in germ granules, we observed an increase in the calcium indicator GCaMP at the posterior and defective primordial germ cell migration, consistent with sra encoding a negative regulator of calcium signaling. In sum, we report an in vivo Cas13-based system for subcellular knockdown, evaluate its feasibility, and uncover a novel function for sra germ granule transcripts in promoting germline development.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

However, with the shift in drug discovery towards laboratory synthesis, there is a decline in the exploration of natural sources for drug development. This downturn calls for return to natural drug discovery and, more importantly, towards the development of improved methods of isolating, identifying, and characterising chemical moieties obtained from plants. This study redirects attention to natural product research by employing advanced metabolomic and computational approaches to characterise the bioactive compounds of Hunteria umbellata. Metabolomic technique was employed, utilising liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to separate the chemical components. The isolated compounds were then identified using their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios. Chromatograms were analysed using a computational molecular networking tool to match the m/z values to known compounds in mass spectrometry libraries. Eighteen compounds were successfully isolated from the methanolic and alkaloidal extracts, including Yohimbine, (-)-Epicatechin, Picrinine, Tubotaiwine, Quercetin-3-O-robinobioside, and Pheophorbide A. To our knowledge, this represents the first comprehensive metabolomic profiling of H. umbellata using computational molecular networking, revealing a diverse set of flavonoids and indole alkaloids. Notably, the detection of Pheophorbide A, a chlorin derivative with photodynamic therapy potential, constitutes a new report for this species and suggests unexplored therapeutic relevance. These findings provide significant insight into the bioactive components of Hunteria umbellata, supporting its traditional medicinal uses. Identifying clinically relevant compounds not only validates traditional practices but also highlights the plant's potential for contributing to modern drug discovery efforts.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Nearly two fifths of enzymes exhibit cell-to-cell variable expression, and half localize to multiple cellular compartments. Metabolic heterogeneity arises largely autonomously of cell cycling, and individual cells reestablish these myriad metabolic phenotypes over several cell divisions. Multiplexed imaging revealed that metabolic states are continuous and that the correlation between metabolic pathways is metabolic state dependent.

To study these dynamics, trajectory inference methods order cells along computationally inferred paths to reconstruct gradual transitions in cell states. However, by encouraging smooth and continuous trajectories, these approaches tend to conflate co-occurring processes-such as proliferation, maturation, and spatial organization-that are jointly reflected in gene expression, potentially overlooking process-specific gene expression dynamics. To address this, we developed VAPOR, which integrates a variational autoencoder with transport operators to model and disentangle cellular gene expression dynamics for potentially co-occurring biological processes. VAPOR inputs single-cell (or spatial) gene expression data into a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn the latent states of cells and then models their latent dynamics as an ordinary differential equation. The latent dynamics are further decomposed into process-specific components parameterized by transport operators (TOs) and their corresponding process weights. Each TO defines a process-specific dynamics, and its weight for each cell quantifies the process's contribution to the cell dynamics. After assessment by simulation studies, we applied VAPOR with benchmarking to real data, including time-course scRNA-seq from postconceptual human brain development, spatial transcriptomics of the mouse hippocampus, and cross-species scRNA-seq spanning human and macaque first-trimester forebrain development. In these applications, VAPOR has identified a variety of temporal and spatial co-occurring processes, such as cell cycle, gliogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuronal migration, along with associated dynamic genes, including those species-specific to human and macaque development.

This provides information about both demographic and adaptive processes acting on the population during that period. A common approach to analyze such data is to model observed allele counts in finite samples using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) where hidden states are true allele frequencies over time (i.e. a trajectory). The HMM framework allows to compute the full likelihood of the data, while accounting both for the stochastic evolution of population allele frequencies along time and for the noise arising from sampling a limited number of individuals at possibly spread out generations. Several such HMM methods have been proposed so far, differing mainly in the way they model the transition probabilities of the Markov chain. Following Paris et al. (2019), we consider here the Beta with Spikes approximation, which avoids the computational issues associated to the Wright-Fisher model while still including fixation probabilities, in contrast to other standard approximations of this model like the Gaussian or Beta distributions. To facilitate the analysis and exploitation of genomic time series data, we present an improved version of Paris et al. (2019) approach, denoted SelNeTime, whose computation time is drastically reduced and which accurately estimates effective population size (assuming no selection) or the selection intensity at each locus (given a previously estimated value of N). We also evaluate the performance of this method in realistic situations where selection is present and both demography and selection need to be inferred.

K.; Lim, H. S.; Rheindt, F. E.; Chisholm, R. A.", "abstract": "Aim: Species occurrence patterns are typically analysed using data-randomisation approaches, which reveal when observed patterns deviate from random expectation, but give little insight why. Mechanistic models, such as neutral models, have been proposed as an alternative null model, but they are computationally expensive. Here, we use an efficient method to simulate such models and explore possible mechanisms governing the occurrence patterns of birds on islands. Location: Riau archipelago, Indonesia. Taxon: Birds. Methods: We used species richness and island--area data to fit a niche--neutral model, where species obey neutral dynamics within non-overlapping discrete niches. We used a sequential sampling algorithm that can efficiently generate randomised presence--absence matrices under the niche-neutral model, and used mismatches to identify which mechanisms were potentially important to occurrence patterns. In particular, we generated assemblages with the sampling algorithm and used a randomisation approach to obtain standardised effect sizes on segregation (C-score) and nestedness (NODF) metrics. Results: Birds were more segregated and less nested than expected from both data randomisation and the niche--neutral model. Further, while the niche--neutral model reproduced the mean relationship between island size and species richness, it could not produce sufficient variability to account for the richness data. However, while the niche--neutral model was rejected as a null, it was possible to reproduce the species-occurrence patterns by allowing niche diversity and per-capita immigration rate to vary across islands, which increased segregation and decreased nestedness, respectively. Main conclusion: While the species-area relationship could be explained by a model with constant per-capita immigration rates and number of niches across islands, inter-island heterogeneity was needed to explain higher-order species-occurrence patterns. The sequential sampling algorithm allowed us to explore different scenarios efficiently and may be useful for identifying potential mechanisms structuring patterns in other systems.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

The tendency of these repetitive DNA sequences to form non-B DNA structures can cause abnormal replication, leading to genomic instability. This instability contributes to disease progression, though the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We investigated the replication of DNA containing CAG and CTG trinucleotide repeats using individual components of the T7 bacteriophage replication machinery, as well as the complete replisome. Our results show that repeats in linear single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) inhibit the activity of T7 DNA polymerase and ssDNA-binding proteins, with a more pronounced effect observed in CTG repeats compared to CAG repeats. Minicircle templates containing CTG repeats exhibited robust DNA synthesis on both the leading and lagging strands, though synthesis was not enhanced by the T7 gene 2.5 ssDNA-binding protein. The lagging strand products generated from the CTG repeat minicircle were significantly longer than those from random sequence templates, and their lengths were not extended by the presence of T7 gene 2.5 protein. When the repeated sequences were incorporated into the T7 phage genome, heterogeneity was observed downstream of the repeats, depending on their length. We propose that aberrant extension occurs predominantly in the lagging strand, driven by dynamic interactions between the repeated sequences and the DNA replisome.

Hypothesis: We hypothesized that cardiomyocyte STIM1 deficiency induced by AAV9-mediated knockdown triggers mitochondrial and metabolic remodeling that alters the electrophysiological (EP) substrate and exacerbates post-MI heart failure. Methods: Eight-week-old mice received cardiotropic AAV9-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA targeting STIM1 (AAV9-shSTIM1) or a control construct (AAV9-shLuc/PBS). Four weeks later, in vivo echocardiography followed by ex vivo optical action potential (AP) mapping were performed to determine the impact of myocardial STIM1 downregulation on mechanical and EP properties. Electron microscopy and western blotting were performed to assess mitochondrial network architecture, dynamics and related metabolic signaling. A separate cohort of mice underwent a 30-minute coronary occlusion followed by reperfusion to induce MI. One week post-MI, left ventricular (LV) function, structural remodeling, and EP properties were assessed in mice with and without myocardial STIM1 knockdown. Results: AAV9-shSTIM1 delivery markedly reduced cardiomyocyte STIM1 expression. STIM1 downregulation induced extensive mitochondrial fragmentation, increased DRP1 phosphorylation at S616 (+55%, p=0.0057), reduced OPA1 expression, and altered AMPK-dependent signaling (reduced phospho-ACC and phospho-Raptor). These mitochondrial and metabolic abnormalities were accompanied by EP instability. In response to in vivo I/R injury, shSTIM1 mice exhibited significantly greater LV dysfunction (-44.3% vs. -12.2% fractional shortening, p<0.0001) and more pronounced structural and EP remodeling with formation of spatially discordant AP alternans 1-week following MI indicative of accelerated heart failure progression. Conclusions: AAV9-mediated STIM1 knockdown exacerbates post-MI cardiac dysfunction likely through impaired mitochondrial dynamics and disrupted metabolic signaling. Beyond worsening post-MI function, STIM1 deficiency alone induces profound EP remodeling, underscoring the pivotal role of cardiomyocyte STIM1 in coordinating mitochondrial homeostasis, electrical stability, and cardiac recovery after injury.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

This study used the model bryophyte Physcomitrium patens, commonly known as Physcomitrella, to uncover such genes and employed CRISPR/Cas9-based and localization-based screening to identify novel cell division genes. Co-expression data from known mitotic genes were used to create a pool of 216 candidate genes, which were targeted for CRISPR/Cas9 screening. Frameshift mutants with division defects were characterized using high-resolution imaging and fluorophore-based protein localization. Three novel gene families--CYR (Cytokinesis-Related), LACH (Lagging Chromosome), and SpinMi (Spindle and Phragmoplast Midzone)--were identified. CYR is linked to cytokinesis defects, LACH is essential for chromosome segregation, and SpinMi localizes to the spindle and phragmoplast midzone. None of these gene families has homologs in algae, suggesting their emergence during land colonization. These findings demonstrate the utility of co-expression-guided and targeted screening for discovering genes involved in specific cellular processes and provide insights into the evolution of the plant cell division machinery.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

K.", "abstract": "This study presents a multiproxy investigation of loess paleosol sequences from the Khovaling Loess Plateau (KLP) in southern Tajikistan to explore longterm human-environment interactions during the Early Paleolithic. This region has been the focus of numerous archaeological projects since Soviet times, as it contains evidence of some of the oldest (approx 0.9 Ma) hominin occupations in Central Asia and is one of the key regions connecting eastern Asia to centers of hominin evolution that lie to the west. Previous archaeological expeditions have discovered rich collections of stone tools from alternating non-pedogenically modified loess and paleosol sequences at the archaeological sites of Karatau, Lakhuti, Obi Mazar, and Kuldura. We analyzed lipid biomarkers such as nalkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), together with newly generated stable isotopes (13C;15N), magnetic susceptibility, and archaeological assemblages from three sites: Obi Mazar/Lakhuti (onsite), and non-artifact-bearing strata from Kuldara (nearsite) and Khonako II (offsite), focusing on pedocomplexes (PCs) 4, 5, and 6 and their intercalated loess layers. High odd-over-even predominance (OEP) and average chain lengths (ACL) suggest that soil organic matter is predominantly derived from higher-order terrestrial plants, with better preservation in paleosols compared to loess layers. The inverse correlations of 13C with TOC and C/N reflect organic matter degradation, while elevated 15N in paleosols suggests enhanced nitrogen cycling under warmer and drier conditions. Magnetic susceptibility and 13C trends reveal a progressive shift toward open grassland ecosystems since ~0.8 Ma, with intensified pedogenesis during interglacial stages MIS 11, 13, and 15. The spatial distribution of PAH concentrations and lithic artifact densities further highlights human-environment interactions in the KLP locality. Obi Mazar exhibits abundant lithic materials and high PAH levels, indicating repeated occupation and frequent burning in a resource rich riverine setting. Kuldara exhibits moderate PAHs but minimal artifacts, whereas Khonako-II records only a minimal level of signals, reflecting a decrease in human impact with distance from the water source. Together, these findings demonstrate that Early Paleolithic hominins preferentially occupied ecologically stable, pedogenically developed zones during interglacial phases, contributing to localized fire regimes and shaping their landscapes. This study provides a refined paleoenvironmental framework for understanding hominin adaptations in Central Asia during the Pleistocene.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

L.; Choy, W.-Y.", "abstract": "The accumulation of alpha-synuclein (a-Syn) as toxic oligomers, and subsequently in Lewy bodies, is a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Molecular chaperones and co-chaperones are expected to act in concert to maintain physiological activities of proteins, including a-Syn, but in neurodegeneration this process can become mal-adaptive. Transcript levels of Stress inducible phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1), a co-chaperone of Hsp90/Hsp70, are elevated in brain samples from PD patients. In synucleinopathy mouse models, STIP1 has unexpected bidirectional effects on a-Syn, with overexpression of STIP1 aggravating a-Syn toxicity, whereas knockdown of STIP1 improves toxicity and behavioural phenotypes. However, it is unclear how STIP1 enhances the toxicity of a-Syn. Here we unravel the mechanisms by which the direct interaction between STIP1/HOP and a-Syn regulates the neurotoxicity of a-Syn. Specifically, two binding motifs in the C-terminus of a-Syn directly interact with the TPR2A domain of STIP1/HOP in a dynamic manner, competing for a shared interface on TPR2A. Binding of STIP1/HOP to a-Syn attenuates the formation of a-Syn fibrils while promoting the accumulation of high molecular weight amorphous a-Syn species. Samples of a-Syn aggregated in the presence of STIP1/HOP contain significantly more A11-positive oligomeric species and cause a greater reduction in cell viability than a-Syn aggregated in the absence of STIP1/HOP in neuronal cells. Our results provide a mechanism by which the direct interaction between STIP1/HOP and the C-terminus of a-Syn promotes the formation of cytotoxic, non-amyloidogenic, high molecular weight a-Syn species. Our model offers an explanation for the unexpected pathological link between STIP1 and a-Syn toxicity, thus opening new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of synucleinopathies.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

We assembled tens of megabases of non-redundant sequence in tens of thousands of large contigs, much of which is present in both SAS and non-SAS populations. We demonstrated that much of this sequence is not discovered by traditional variant discovery approaches even when using complete genomes and pangenomes. Across 20,000 placed contigs, we found 8,215 intersections with 106 protein coding genes and >15,000 placements within 1 kbp of a known GWAS hit. We used long read data from a subset of samples to validate the majority of their assembled sequences, aligned RNA-seq data to identify hundreds of unplaced contigs with transcriptional potential, and queried existing nucleotide databases to evaluate the origins of the remaining unplaced sequences.

Understanding this closed loop between perception and action remains a central challenge in neuroscience. A key example is active vision, where observers decide where to look next, selectively sampling from their visual space to guide ongoing perception and action. However, despite major advances in linking neural activity with behavior and computational modeling of vision under passive viewing conditions, the interactive aspects of natural vision remain underexplored. Visual search, the act of locating a target among distractors, exemplifies this dynamic sampling process and has long served as a core paradigm for studying visual attention. While its behavioral and neural signatures have been characterized in humans and non-human primates, a unifying model that links these neural phenomena to behavior during visual search has been lacking. Here, we present a biologically aligned neural network model trained to perform visual search directly from natural scenes by generating sequences of saccades to locate a target. The model generalizes to novel objects and scenes, produces human-like scanpaths, and recapitulates classic behavioral biases in human visual search. Strikingly, units in the model exhibit neural response properties characteristic of the fronto-parietal network, including a stable cue template in working memory, a retinocentric cue-similarity map, and prospective fixation signals. Beyond reproducing known behavioral and neural phenomena, the model reveals a representational geometry that supports cue-driven prioritization, spatial memory, and planning of future fixations. These results establish a computational framework for studying visual search as an emergent property of goal-directed perception, offering concrete predictions for neurophysiological and behavioral testing, and paving the way toward a unified account of active vision.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Although theoretical models suggest that such divergence is notably facilitated by small population size and genetic polymorphisms influencing reproductive timing, though constrained by genetic load, empirical validation remains limited. We investigated these predictions by re-analyzing a case of allochronic differentiation between two sympatric populations of pine processionary moth (Thaumetopoea pityocampa) in Portugal, using whole genome resequencing (IndSeq and PoolSeq) of those two populations and eight allopatric ones. We inferred the demographic history of those populations, assessed their genetic load, and searched for genomic regions associated with life cycle differences. Our analyses revealed a recent split between the sympatric allochronic populations, accompanied by a strong reduction in gene flow, bottlenecks, inbreeding, and accumulation of deleterious variants. Genome scans identified several loci associated with life cycle variation, including genes putatively involved in circadian rhythm regulation, predominantly located on the Z chromosome. We discuss how these empirical genomic findings support theoretical expectations that assortative mating driven by differences in reproductive timing, underpinned by polymorphisms in circadian genes, along with genetic drift and purge of genetic load at high-impact sites, can promote the onset and persistence of allochronic divergence.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

We investigate the role of the biofilm matrix in antibiotic tolerance using 3D biofilm models based on acetylated alginate and DNA, which mimic mucoid biofilms. Printed from these bioinks seeded with P. aeruginosa (PAO1), these models support robust microcolony formation, as observed in vivo, and enable high-throughput assessment of antibiotic diffusion and efficacy. Surprisingly, antibiotic diffusion is not significantly impeded by acetylation or extracellular DNA incorporation. Despite this, bacterial tolerance increases tremendously upon encapsulation in alginate. Acetylation further enhances tolerance, particularly to tobramycin, ciprofloxacin, and colistin. Addition of DNA mitigates this effect in a drug-specific manner. While mucoid biofilms, in contrast to the biofilm models, exhibit significant retardation of antibiotic penetration, they also become saturated with all tested antibiotics within 20 hours. This demonstrates that direct interaction with alginate or DNA does not explain the slow diffusion of antibiotics in mucoid P. aeruginosa biofilms. Our findings challenge the view that diffusion limitation or antibiotic binding by biofilm exopolysaccharides dominates biofilm resilience, highlighting the need to target matrix-induced bacterial adaptation in the development of antibiofilm therapies.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

How tardigrades can repair widespread DNA damage without producing frequent, large-scale chromosome structural abnormalities, like chromosome translocations and fusions, is unknown. Here, we report the results of examining chromosome and nuclear architecture throughout the cell cycle in early embryos of H. exemplaris. We found that H. exemplaris chromosomes are maintained in an individualized form throughout the cell cycle. We were surprised to also find that each chromosome is housed in a fully or partially separate lamin-lined compartment, instead of all chromosomes being housed in a single, nearly spherical nuclear lamina and envelope.

Here, we used molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the effects of DSIF on the dynamics and structure of Pol II and upstream nucleic acids, thereby gaining a mechanistic understanding of its role in transcription elongation. We determined three major sites of impact by DSIF, including the upstream nucleic acids, Pol II clamp, and active site, which potentially contribute to its role in transcription processivity. Our results showed that DSIF affects the dynamics of upstream DNA and RNA at the exit sites, preventing the unwinding of DNA and the folding of RNA. In addition, our results suggest that DSIF regulates the motion of the Pol II clamp to potentially maintain a proper size at the central cleft. We also observed a more dynamic active site and increased interactions between active site domains.

(Rosaceae), is an iconic and ecologically important member of chaparral and oak woodland communities in the California Floristic Province. Toyon's habitat faces changing wildfire regimes, widening variation in annual rainfall, and competition by invasive introduced species. We used a new modeling pipeline, temporal analysis of reproduction distributed in space (TARDIS) to examine how recent climate trends have shaped habitat suitability for toyon. Methods: As input data for TARDIS, we annotated flowering and fruiting in images from 4,105 observations of toyon contributed to the iNaturalist crowdsourcing platform. From these records we trained Bayesian additive regression tree models relating weather to toyon flowering intensity. We used a trained model to hindcast flowering each year back to 1900, and examined trends in hindcast flowering. For comparison, we also modeled changing habitat suitability using a conventional species distribution model (SDM) relating toyon presence to 30-year climate averages. Key results: Toyon flowering is associated with greater winter precipitation and warmer fall and winter temperatures. Our hindcast predicts that mean flowering intensity has been stable to slightly increasing since 1900, with greater increases in intensity at higher elevations, but also at lower latitudes. Annual variation in flowering intensity has also increased, especially at lower latitudes. Hindcast trends in flowering are positively correlated with changes in SDM-predicted suitability. Conclusions: TARDIS recovers biologically realistic predictors of toyon flowering, and hindcast changes in flowering intensity indicate the species' range remains suitable after 125 years of changing climate. Overall our results indicate toyon populations remain healthy, but may have limited opportunity to migrate northwards as climate change continues.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

S.; Venkateshvaran, A.; Suresh, Y.; Mamgain, H.; Ramanathan, A.", "abstract": "Cellular senescence, a stable growth-arrested state induced by stress or chemotherapeutic agents, is accompanied by metabolic remodeling that supports the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Among these pathways, lipid and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism play central roles in maintaining and propagating the senescent state. Here, we used hyperspectral confocal Raman microscopy to visualize biochemical remodeling in MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells undergoing doxorubicin-induced senescence. Raman spectral analysis and principal-component decomposition revealed time-dependent alterations in lipid-associated vibrational modes-particularly CH2; and C=C stretching-consistent with enhanced lipid accumulation and remodeling between days 10 and 15 after DNA-damage induction. PCA of lipid-rich compartments isolated using true component analysis also confirms progressive increases in triacylglycerol and unsaturated lipid signatures. Using deuterated arachidonic acid (AA-d8) and COX-2 inhibition, we further demonstrated real-time intracellular AA metabolism by tracking C=C-D stretching peaks (2220-2254 cm-1) in the Raman-silent window. The ratio of these deuterium bands to CH2; stretching provided a label-free quantitative metric for COX2-dependent AA turnover in senescent cells. Together, these findings establish Raman hyperspectral imaging as a powerful, non-perturbative tool to map lipid and oxylipin metabolism during cellular senescence, offering new avenues to identify metabolic vulnerabilities in senescent tumor cells.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Despite their importance, we have a limited understanding of their behavior in vivo. Many dynamic cellular functions of macrophages involve intracellular Ca2+ signaling. However, to our knowledge, virtually nothing is known about the spatiotemporal Ca2+ dynamics of meningeal macrophages. We developed a chronic intravital two-photon imaging approach and related computational analysis tools to interrogate meningeal macrophage Ca2+ dynamics, at a subcellular resolution, in a novel Pf4Cre:TIGRE2.0GCaMP6s/wt reporter mouse model. Using imaging in awake mice, we characterized the Ca2+ activity of meningeal macrophages at steady state and in response to cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), an aberrant pro-inflammatory brain hyperexcitability event, implicated in migraine, traumatic brain injury, and stroke. In homeostatic meninges, macrophages in the dural perivascular niche exhibited several Ca2+ dynamic features, including event duration and signal frequency spectrum, distinct from those of in the interstitial, non-perivascular niche. Simultaneous tracking of meningeal macrophage Ca2+ dynamics and local vasomotion revealed a subset of dural perivascular macrophages whose activity was coupled to behaviorally-driven diameter fluctuations of their associated vessels. Most perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages displayed propagating intracellular Ca2+ activity as well as synchronized intercellular Ca2+ elevations, likely driven by extrinsic factors. In response to CSD, the majority of perivascular and non-perivascular meningeal macrophages showed a persistent decrease in Ca2+ activity, while a smaller subset displayed Ca2+ elevations. Mechanistically, CGRP/RAMP1 signaling mediated the increase but not the decrease in CSD-mediated Ca2+ signaling. Collectively, our results highlight a previously unknown diversity of meningeal macrophage Ca2+ dynamics at steady state and in response to an aberrant brain hyperexcitability event linked to neuroinflammation.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

When paired with conformal prediction, this approach enables the construction of prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage, offering lower and upper bounds within which the phenotype is likely to fall with high probability. We apply this framework to data from the UK Biobank and the ProgeNIA/SardiNIA studies, showing that the resulting prediction intervals: (1) maintain valid coverage under minimal model assumptions, (2) provide more realistic individualized estimates of uncertainty by allowing for asymmetry and individual-specific interval lengths, and (3) exhibit reduced uncertainty compared to existing methods.

We demonstrate that two alleles, Pm3d and Pm3e, provide resistance against the majority of isolates worldwide, by each recognizing two AVR effectors from powdery mildew, thereby lowering the risk of resistance breakdown.

The chemotaxis machinery is typically arranged in highly ordered polar arrays containing an assortment of chemoreceptors and signal transduction proteins. Pseudomonas putida is a polarly flagellated soil bacterium that displays a chemotactic response towards numerous organic compounds present in the rhizosphere. In this work we demonstrate the involvement of the polar landmark proteins FimV, ParC and ParP in the polar assembly of the flagellar motility-associated chemosensory arrays. Confocal microscopy of fluorescent protein fusions and image analysis provide evidence that FimV, ParC, ParP are sequentially recruited to the new cell pole during the cell cycle. This recruitment hierarchy is supported by the observations that FimV is required for ParC localization and FimV and ParC stimulate ParP localization. Bacterial two-hybrid assays suggest the involvement of direct interactions between the three proteins. Our results also show that ParC displays a pole-to-pole oscillatory behavior that results in asymmetric inheritance after cell division. Analysis of the location of the chemoreceptors Aer1 and Aer2 and the histidine kinase CheA illustrates the central role of ParC and ParP in the assembly of polar chemosensory arrays, as both proteins are required for polar recruitment of Aer1 and Aer2 and further promote stable association between CheA and the chemoreceptors at the cell poles.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis work reveals the mechanisms that enable the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida to recruit and assemble the components of its chemotaxis machinery at the new cell pole in the time spanned between two cell divisions.

The determinants of male reproductive success in egalitarian societies are less well understood. We investigated male reproductive monopolization in wild Guinea baboons (Papio papio), an egalitarian multilevel society in which one-male \"units\" are nested within larger social groups (\"parties\") and male-male contest competition is low. Using nine years of behavioral and genetic data from five parties, we examined how reproductive success is distributed across males at different social levels. Paternity data show that 93% of the 71 infants were sired by the female's \"unit male\", with rare extra-unit paternities consistent with limited control models. Within parties, reproduction was shared among multiple unit males, resulting in low reproductive skew. The most successful males accounted for 23-40% of paternities within parties, well below the proportions reported in strictly hierarchical species. Takeovers of females were rare, suggesting male restraint. Reproductive success, assessed as the number of unit females, was positively associated with dominance ratings, yet males with average dominance ratings had the largest units. Altogether, prime-age was a better predictor of reproductive success than dominance. In conclusion, male Guinea baboons' reproductive success is shaped less by dominance and more by long-term associations with females, who play an active role in inter-sexual relationships. Our study emphasizes the need to move beyond frameworks focused solely on dominance-based mechanisms and to incorporate species-specific social organization when evaluating reproductive strategies.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Shared selective pressures on network members and compensatory changes between members can drive their parallel evolutionary trajectories. Indeed, correlated evolutionary rates of amino acid sequence change have been observed for interacting reproductive proteins. But whether gene copy number changes also correlate has not been widely studied. Here, we investigated copy number variation (CNV) of genes in the Drosophila Sex Peptide Seminal Fluid Protein (Sfp) network. Previous research analyzed CNV of the Sfp Sex Peptide (SP) in Drosophila species. We focus on 9 other Sfps whose function is required to mediate the binding of SP to sperm in D. melanogaster which is required for persistence of female post-mating responses. To exhaustively annotate CNV of genes, we developed a computational pipeline pairing iterative protein queries to genome sequence searches with phylogenetic clustering to resolve homology relationships. We observed that the Sfp networks genes are ancestral to Drosophila and that there were repeated duplications and losses of network members across the genus. We detect statistically significant correlations in gene duplication or loss events among network proteins, and show this can be used to identify new members of the network. We also investigated CNV of female-derived proteins that act downstream of the SP sperm-binding network to modulate SP function, these proteins showed no significant correlation of gene turnover events with SP or its network. Our results provide insight into how evolving reproductive genes tolerate duplication and loss, and how network relationships could constrain reproductive protein evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementReproductive proteins often diverge rapidly between species, yet network function must be maintained. Shared selective pressures on network members and compensatory changes between members can drive their parallel evolutionary trajectories. We report correlated gene duplication and loss among members of the Drosophila Sex Peptide seminal fluid protein network, suggesting that duplication or loss events may drive corresponding events in other network genes. This work is a natural extension of the idea of evolutionary rate covariation, but instead of scoring rates of substitution it tracks correlated duplication and loss events on the phylogeny. Applied to the Sex Peptide network, the method reveals striking patterns, especially for coordinated loss, and identifies a new network gene that is experimentally confirmed.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

With 10% protonation in sidechains, the 1H signals displayed linewidths of approximately 50Hz, facilitating the extraction of 49 longrange distance restraints between amide and side-chain protons, which are crucial for structural convergence. Ambiguities in the assignment of weak signals corresponding to distance restraints were resolved by integrating 3D hNHH experimental data with CS Rosetta structural modeling. The resulting structure reveals a well-defined pentameric assembly, with transmembrane helix packing consistent with that observed in detergent environments. This study demonstrates significant sensitivity advantages of 1H detected over 13C detected in situ ssNMR methods, highlighting the potential of 1H detected ssNMR for the structure determination of a broad range of membrane proteins in native membranes.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

One OM lipoprotein, DolP, has been shown to localize at the cell division site and to facilitate the daughter cell separation. Yet how DolP is recruited to the division site remains unclear at the molecular level. Here, we show that DolP arrives concomitantly with the late divisome protein FtsN. Utilizing single-particle tracking Photoactivated Localization Microscopy (spt-PALM), we investigated the dynamics of individual DolP molecules in living Escherichia coli cells. Single-molecule analysis revealed two diffusion states: a diffusive state across the cell envelope and a previously underappreciated immobile state enriched at the septal and polar regions. Importantly, DolP does not comigrate with the processive FtsW-FtsI-FtsN complex. Mutations of the cardiolipin-binding surface caused loss of mid-cell enrichment and reduced the immobile fraction. Cardiolipin's preference for high negative curvature enriches it at the division site, creating a trapping environment for DolP. Additionally, the active septal constriction but not the late divisome proteins recruit DolP. Together, these findings indicate that cardiolipin-mediated immobilization underlies DolP's septal enrichment.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

In particular, the global arrangement of structural features of the cortex provides insight into neurodevelopmental processes that underlie individual differences in perception and cognition. Structural covariance networks (SCNs), which capture regional coordination of brain morphometry, are an efficient method to derive global properties of the cortex. However, their interpretation relies on an array of methodological choices that are often inconsistent between studies. Using a hierarchically-clustered version of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) atlas, we constructed SCNs of regional cortical surface area for groups with four different conditions -- synaesthesia, autism, early psychosis, and anxiety or depression -- and compared global network properties with those of age- and sex-matched controls. SCNs for synaesthesia and autism showed globally stronger connectivity, with specific increases at moderate cortical distances, as well as lower network complexity. Conversely, the SCN for early psychosis showed a globally lower connectivity and a greater complexity, while depression and anxiety showed few differences compared to controls. The results for autism and depression were replicated across two datasets each. These findings support the notion that synaesthesia and autism share neurodevelopmental mechanisms, while psychosis may involve a diverging process.

Our recent findings provide evidence that a newly described sEV secretion pathway, the amphiectosome release and the 'torn bag mechanism', is present in all tested cell lines and in mouse liver and kidney. Surprisingly, in in situ fixed steady-state cells, transmission electron microscopy did not reveal the classical exosome secretion route, the sEV release via exocytosis of multivesicular endosomes (MVEs). In the current study, we investigated which parameters influence the activation of the two distinct sEV release mechanisms. Our results show that under stress conditions (such as Ca2+ ionophore-induced membrane stress or metabolic stress-induced by serum starvation), exocytosis of MVEs is activated, while this process is absent in steady-state conditions. By silencing ATG5 (a key regulator of autophagy) and RAB27a (essential small GTPase for MVE exocytosis), we selectively modulated these two mechanisms. Amphiectosome release depended on both autophagy and ATG5, while exocytosis of MVE was autophagy-independent but RAB27a-dependent. Our findings suggest that sEV release via the 'torn bag mechanism' is a general and essential secretion pathway in non-stressed, steady-state mammalian cells, while stress conditions induce the sEV release via MVE exocytosis.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

We study experiments on malignant B cell lines, which find that depending on their environment, B cells can either be attracted or repelled by signals like CCL19. The presence of chemorepulsion is also dependent on whether the receptors for CCL19 can be internalized via endocytosis. We develop a stochastic model of receptor-ligand binding and internalization where bound receptors drive a nonlinear feed-forward loop of intracellular signaling molecules, which determine the cell's direction. We recapitulate key experimental results: changing CCL19 concentration or inhibiting receptor internalization can switch the cell's direction. Our model implies that cells can navigate toward a target concentration of a signal, regulating that target by receptor internalization.

We pursued three objectives: (a) establish and morphologically characterize BEEO, (b) define BEEO transcriptomic and secretory responses to estradiol (E2), medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), and interferon-tau (IFN{tau}), and (c) determine whether BEEO-derived IOF can support in vitro embryonic development beyond Day 8 (hatched blastocyst stage) under conventional culture conditions. BEEO were established from primary endometrial tissue (n=4) and maintained a stable epithelial phenotype through multiple passages. Transcriptomic profiling revealed robust responses to stimulation, with E2, MPA, and IFN{tau} inducing distinct gene expression programs consistent with in vivo effects. IOF metabolomic analysis confirmed hormone-dependent regulation of IOF secretory output, with E2+MPA (diestrus mimic) enhancing the production of metabolites implicated in conceptus development. Remarkably, IOF from diestrus mimic-stimulated BEEO, despite being diluted approximately seven-fold in PBS, maintained embryo survival rates comparable to optimized commercial medium, and exceeded PBS-only controls.

Mitochondria repositioning to sites of high energy demand is governed by a balance between opposing dynein and kinesin-1 (KIF5B) molecular motors whose regulation remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify the SYBU gene as a candidate prognostic marker downregulated in metastatic disease. SYBU encodes syntabulin, a mitochondria outer membrane protein that interacts with dynein to counterbalance KIF5B-dependent anterograde transport to the cell cortex. Loss of SYBU disrupts the balance, causing excessive KIF5B-driven mitochondria movement, microtubule damage and deacetylation. In turn, microtubule deacetylation reinforces KIF5B-mediated transport, creating a positive feedback loop that drives mitochondria distribution close to the cell periphery and enhances cancer cell migration. Pharmacological inhibition of the tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 restores mitochondrial positioning and reduces cell migration in SYBU-deficient cells.

We found that proliferating MenSCs from endometriosis patients (Endo) have a defective DDR that is also present when these cells reach confluence. In G1, these cells contain more 53BP1-nuclear bodies (NBs) and are less senescent than healthy samples. We also treated with hydroxyurea (Hu) to generate replication stress and found that Endo MenSCs responded to this treatment by activating the DDR and generating more 53BP1-NBs. We examined the MRN complex, upstream of the ATM-dependent DDR. Hu treatment of our cell lines resulted in downregulation of all genes encoding the MRN complex, and RAD50 and NBS1 proteins. In a scRNA-seq dataset of endometriosis stromal tissue, we also identified downregulation of RAD50 and NBS1. To evaluate the growth potential of MenSCs, we decidualized cells after Hu treatment and then replated them in growing medium.

During this process, unfit loser cells commonly upregulate the C/EBP family transcription factor Xrp1, which causes their elimination, indicating that intracellular Xrp1 levels determine cellular fitness. However, despite its central role, the mechanism by which Xrp1 is upregulated in unfit cells remains unknown. Here, we show that Xrp1 is upregulated through a previously unrecognized post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism mediated by the ribosomal protein S12 (RpS12). Surprisingly, Xrp1 mRNA is abundantly expressed even in wild-type cells, yet it is not translated. This is due to an upstream open reading frame (uORF) located in the 5'UTR of the initial coding exon of Xrp1 mRNA, which inhibits the translation of the main Xrp1 ORF. Intriguingly, in unfit cells, RpS12 causes splicing-mediated skipping of this initial exon, leading to the use of an alternate start codon that generates a short isoform of Xrp1 protein, causing cell death. Notably, protein structural analysis reveals that RpS12 is highly homologous to that of a spliceosomal component SNU13, suggesting the role of RpS12 in directly regulating alternative splicing of Xrp1 mRNA. Our findings thus provide not only a mechanistic insights into how cellular fitness is determined but also how tissue optimization is achieved.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

SMCs were cultured on collagen I-, fibronectin-, or laminin-coated plates under static conditions, physiological stretch (10% elongation), or pathological stretch (15% elongation), followed by bulk RNA sequencing. Mechanical stretch regulated genes involved in cell cycle regulation, contractile function, and inflammatory signaling. While functional effects on proliferation and contractility were modest, inflammatory pathways were strongly affected by stretch intensity. Physiological stretch suppressed basal and TNF-induced inflammatory gene expression, whereas pathological stretch enhanced it, with consistent effects across all ECM substrates. Physiological stretch downregulated multiple NF-kappaB target genes and reduced IKBKB expression. IKBKB knockdown lowered baseline inflammatory gene expression and abolished stretch-induced suppression of CCL2, indicating an NF-kappaB-dependent mechanism, likely downstream of p65 translocation. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed pronounced phenotypic heterogeneity in cultured SMCs. Integration with human atherosclerosis datasets showed that in vitro SMC states partially overlapped with plaque SMC phenotypes but displayed a globally enhanced pro-inflammatory phenotype. Importantly, stretch-induced suppression of inflammatory signaling was observed across the heterogeneous SMC population. Physiological mechanical stretch induces strong anti-inflammatory effects in human SMCs.

Restored FOXM1 activity in aged cells reduces DNA damage and epigenetic alterations driving senescence. Mechanistically, FOXM1 drives the transcription of DNA repair genes, which prevents the DNA damage-driven degradation of the G9a methyltransferase and subsequent loss of H3K9me2 at the nuclear periphery.

Recently a study from the Sudmant laboratory that used an advanced, high fidelity mutational analysis reported that somatic mutations in protein-coding genes exhibit signatures of negative selection. This report came as surprise as several other studies including those that used same technology reported either lack of selection or positive (destructive) selection on somatic mutations. We hypothesized that these discrepancies may stem, in part, from the inclusion of germline mutations in addition to somatic ones, which could bias selection analyses due to the high synonymity of the latter. To test this, we reanalyzed the Sudmant dataset by separating mutations into germline (defined as shared between related animals) and somatic (not shared between tissues of an animal). We then employed a cumulative curve approach to assess selection without bias. Our analysis reveals that, indeed, an apparent purifying selection signal is driven by an admixture of synonymous germline mutations and disappears upon their removal. The remaining somatic mutations for most part show overall dynamics consistent with neutral drift. However, mutations at higher mutant fractions show positive selection trend, most compatible with a low proportion of mutations experiencing positive selection. While we do not exclude rare or context-specific selection events, our results argue against pervasive somatic selection and highlight the importance of rigorous stratification when interpreting mtDNA mutational patterns.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

To dissociate their roles, we applied inhibitory transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over M1, SMA, or a sham condition in 72 healthy participants and characterized the activity of single motor units from high-density EMG recorded during a sustained isometric contraction. Our results revealed a clear functional divergence. M1 inhibition produced a direct failure of motor output, causing a rapid force decline compared to sham, which was strongly correlated with a reduction in motor unit firing rates. Conversely, SMA inhibition did not impair net force. Instead, it altered the fundamental structure of the motor command, compelling a compensatory strategy characterized by a reliance on smaller-amplitude motor units with lower firing rates and a marked degradation of the low-frequency (delta-band) coherence that organizes stable output. These results provide direct causal evidence that M1 directly dictates the magnitude of motor output via population firing rates, while SMA orchestrates the composition and temporal structure of the active motor unit pool to generate an efficient and stable command.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

We assessed how ungulate presence influences aboveground and soil carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions in wetlands. Aboveground carbon stocks declined from 36.9 to 3.70 Mg C per ha in the presence of ungulates. Soil carbon stocks were higher in the absence of ungulates (257 Mg C per ha) than in their presence (112 Mg C per ha). CO-equivalent emissions were higher in the presence of non-native ungulates (38.4 Mg CO2 eq per ha per year) than in the presence of native ungulates (27.2 Mg CO2 eq per ha per year), and higher in freshwater wetlands of warm temperate dry regions when ungulates were present (27.2 Mg CO2 eq per ha per year) compared to when ungulates were absent (13.2 Mg CO2 eq per ha per year).

Many AAA patients develop intraluminal thrombus (ILT), but the role of ILT in AAA progression and rupture is not well understood. To evaluate ILT in AAAs, we induced AAAs in male C57Bl6/J mice (n=25) via surgical application of topical elastase (5 microL of 5 or 10 mg/mL) to the abdominal aorta below the renal arteries and administration of beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN, 0.2%) drinking water. We collected weekly/biweekly ultrasound images over 56 days. Mice were euthanized and histology images were collected. We semi-quantitatively assessed elastin degradation and inflammation from Movat's pentachrome and H&E-stained samples, respectively. Mice with ILT had more significant expansion over the length of the study (beginning at day 14, p<0.05). From histology, ILT samples showed more elastin disorganization and greater inflammation. From scanning electron microscopy, we were able to confirm the presence of layered sheets of fibrin and abnormally shaped red blood cells (polyhedrocytes) within the ILT deposits. In this model, elastase causes aortic injury by degrading elastin fibrils in the aortic wall, reducing the ability of the aorta to contract during high-pressure blood flow. Further damage to the extracellular matrix is likely driven by subsequent inflammation. Here we observed tissue samples with greater acute-on-chronic inflammation were correlated with more elastin damage, and therefore greater aortic expansion. Further, larger aortic expansions were correlated with slower blood flow, likely due to increased cross-sectional area. Thus, increased aortic expansion and damage to the aortic wall may be more likely to create hemodynamic conditions that are conducive to the initiation of ILT deposition: endothelial damage and reduced blood flow. Understanding the relationship between ILT formation, aortic wall degradation, and inflammation could help refine therapeutic strategies for treating AAAs.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "The bacterial flagellar motor drives bacterial swimming and chemotaxis by rotating helical flagellar filaments. When Escherichia coli navigates chemical gradients, the motor switches from counterclockwise (CCW) during forward swimming to clockwise (CW) during direction-changing tumbles. The motor responds indirectly to extracellular chemosensory input to membrane-bound chemoreceptors using an intervening intracellular signaling pathway. How the motor responds to its direct input signal -- the diffusible messenger CheY-P -- remains poorly understood. Steady-state motor measurements have been modeled as an allosteric switch between CCW/CW states that depend on mean CheY-P levels. Allosteric models have suggested that as many as 20 CheY-P molecules can be bound to the motor when it switches rotational direction. But steady-state models cannot predict the sensitivity of the motor to dynamic changes in CheY-P that essentially modulate chemotactic behavior. We present an optogenetic reagent that precisely controls the direct dynamical input signal to the motor. We designed a ``caged'' molecule, Opto-CheY, that is transiently activated by photon absorption. We find that activation and binding of 1-3 CheY-P molecules is sufficient to switch the motor from the CCW to CW state. The sensitivity of the motor to small changes in CheY-P occupancy helps resolve a long-standing paradox about the high sensitivity of the chemotactic response to external sensory input. Optogenetic biochemistry by light-activated uncaging of signal molecules is a new strategy to dissect information-processing in the living cell.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

This may stem, in part, from inconsistent AEX parameters (i.e., intensity, structure, and duration) employed within and across studies. Additionally, evidence suggests that AEX can enhance a specific form of motor learning, namely motor adaptation. Moderate- and high-intensity AEX can increase motor adaptation, but evidence remains limited and inconsistent. Hence, the impact of AEX intensity on motor adaptation remains unclear. Here, we investigated the influence of AEX intensity on motor adaptation, while controlling for AEX structure and duration. Eighty young adults were assigned to four cycling AEX/Rest groups (n=20/group): 20 min of light (LIIT), moderate (MIIT), or high (HIIT) intensity interval training, or Rest (control). AEX consisted of four 3-min cycling intervals (LIIT, 35% heart rate reserve [HRR]; MIIT, 55%HRR; HIIT, 80%HRR) and 2-min active recovery (25%HRR). Participants practiced a visuomotor rotation task immediately after AEX/Rest (adaptation) and at a no-AEX 24 h retention test (motor learning). We found that: (1) all AEX intensities enhanced motor learning compared to Rest, and (2) HIIT enhanced motor adaptation and learning to the greatest extent, followed by MIIT then LIIT. This is the first study to demonstrate a dose-response effect of AEX intensity on motor adaptation and learning.

Herbivore nutritional requirements, and the nutrient contents of herbivore biomass, depend on temperature - at temperature extremes, more nutritious food is required to maximize growth rate and herbivore biomass contains fewer nutrients. Yet, the consequences of these thermal responses for the population dynamics of herbivore-autotroph systems have not been explored. Here, we develop and analyze a stoichiometrically-explicit, temperature-dependent model of herbivore-autotroph systems to answer the question: How does the thermal response of herbivore nutritional traits affect population responses to temperature and nutrient (phosphorus) supply? We find that temperature-dependent herbivore nutritional traits restrict the range of temperatures at which herbivore populations persist, reduce the stability of population dynamics at high phosphorus supplies, and limit the herbivores capacity to control autotroph population density. These results reflect temperature-dependent changes in the herbivores sensitivity to nutrient-poor autotroph biomass and ability to retain nutrients in biomass (and thereby dilute autotroph nutrient contents). The thermal response of herbivore nutritional traits may therefore be an important factor influencing population and community responses to warming and nutrient enrichment.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Current mechanistic models rely primarily on either flux balance analysis (FBA), estimating intracellular fluxes while assuming steady state, or kinetic modeling, capturing dynamic behavior but typically for a limited number of reactions. Dynamic FBA (dFBA) integrates both approaches in a hybrid framework, but challenges remain in integrating the two formats to describe bioprocesses. In this study, we first enhanced an existing dynamic CHO-metabolism model by incorporating 13C-labeled data to refine kinetic expressions and stoichiometric constraints of amino acid pathways, including the asparagine-aspartate network and serine biosynthesis. We next evaluated the impact of prioritizing either stoichiometry, through the pseudo steady state assumption (PSSA), or the kinetic expressions of fluxes. Comparing error and predictive performance for both models for two industrially relevant fed-batch CHO culture conditions involving varying initial concentrations of nutrients and three feed streams, demonstrated that the kinetic-oriented model (KOM) yielded superior predictions for viable cell density (VCD), antibody production, and a range of amino acids and metabolites compared to the stoichiometric oriented model (SOM). Indeed, the KOM was able to predict production-to-consumption shifts of lactate and alanine, fluctuating levels of ammonia based on reversible kinetic expressions, and amino acids like asparagine and the serine-glycine pool. The KOM also provided better predictions for a third case including lactate-supplemented (LS) feed; however, slight parameter adjustments helped to improve model fidelity, likely due to the impact of high lactate on kinetic expressions of antibody (directly) and VCD (indirectly). In summary, our findings demonstrate that hybrid models emphasizing empirical kinetics over strict pseudo-steady-state constraints capture biologically realistic dynamics such as transient shifts for key metabolites like lactate, alanine, and ammonia, and also produce parameters useful across varying conditions, making them a practical and powerful tool for characterizing CHO cell culture performance in the future.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Here we present a systems-level analysis of the ECS that integrates protein-protein and protein-chemical interactions into a unified network framework. Interaction data were obtained from multiple public databases, and networks constructed using NetworkX captured the molecular landscape of ECS signaling. Centrality analyses identified the primary cannabinoid receptors, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CNR1) and cannabinoid receptor 2 (CNR2), as major hubs with extensive connectivity to endogenous and exogenous ligands. In addition to these canonical receptors, transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and G-protein coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) emerged as highly ranked nodes across multiple centrality measures, underscoring their integrative roles within the ECS. Community analyses revealed that key nodes, including the primary cannabinoid receptors CNR1 and CNR2, along with major ligands such as the endocannabinoids anandamide (AEA), 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and various phytocannabinoids, sustain network connectivity and organize into biologically coherent receptor-centered and metabolic communities. Perturbation analyses showed that removal of highly connected hubs, particularly CNR1, disrupted network integrity and signaling relationships among synthetic cannabinoids and endocannabinoids. This disruption simultaneously increased the influence of other receptors, including CNR2 and GPR55, revealing compensatory mechanisms that preserve network resilience.

This loss of communication necessitates assistive technologies to restore interaction and independence. One such technology, the P300 speller brain-computer interface (BCI), translates EEG signals into text by tracking a subjects neural responses to highlighted characters on a screen. A central challenge in P300-based research is enhancing performance to enable faster and more efficient user interaction. In this context, this study addresses key limitations, particularly in the training of multi-subject classifiers, and integrating advanced language models to optimize stimuli presentation and word prediction, thereby improving communication efficiency. Specifically, we introduce three key innovations:- Advanced multi-subject classifier training- Integrating and evaluating impact of numerous large language models (LLMs) on speller performance- Determining P300 LLM performance bounds using an ideal LLM with perfect prediction We conduct extensive simulations using randomly sampled EEG data. Our results demonstrate substantial speed improvements in typing passages that include rare and out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. The magnitude of improvement depends on the type of language model used. More specifically, character-level models provide typing speed improvements of approximately 10%, while open-source LLMs such as Llama, Mistral and GPT2 achieve around 40% improvement through efficient word prediction. Additionally, we construct an ideal LLM to establish theoretical performance limits and show that many modern LLMs achieve performance levels within 10% of it. Further, we show that these LLM-driven speed improvements generalize across classifiers, including those designed to reduce subject-specific training.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Both circadian rhythm and a homeostatic process determine the daily sleep profile, which is also regulated by environmental light, a major sensory input to regulate circadian rhythm and alertness. With decades of investigation in Drosophila, the cellular and circuital mechanism underlying light-mediated circadian synchronization are well-established, yet the direct relationship between light/visual input and sleep remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, we have started an investigatory survey of sleep behaviour using classic mutant lines to manipulate phototransduction and downstream neural transmission. We observed consistent day sleep fragmentation in flies with mutations in multiple phototransduction components. We also found hyperpolarised Drosophila photoreceptor resulted in shorter day sleep. We found a severe reduction in locomotor speed in several visual mutants during normal waking time preventing assessment of their sleep-linked immobility.

M.; Azhar, D.; Amematsro, P.; Butts, A. R.; Caron, S. J. C.", "abstract": "Learning and memory centers must balance maximizing coding capacity with prioritizing biologically relevant information. Expansion layers, a circuit motif common to many learning and memory centers, including the insect mushroom body, transform dense sensory representations into sparse, distributed ones, and theoretical models propose that random connectivity within these layers maximizes coding capacity by generating highly discriminable responses. Yet this solution creates a fundamental problem: purely random connectivity treats all stimuli equally, without prioritizing survival-relevant cues over neutral ones. Here, we show that the Drosophila melanogaster mushroom body resolves this capacity-selectivity trade-off through systematic biases in projection neuron-Kenyon cell connectivity. Although connectivity is random at the single-cell level, some projection neuron types connect up to 15-fold more frequently than others. These biases translate directly into function: Kenyon cell responses scales with projection neuron connectivity, and the breadth of odor-evoked responses predicts learning performance. Odors activating more than 20% of Kenyon cells drive robust associative memories, whereas those activating fewer than 10% are poorly learned. VL1 projection neurons are a notable exception: despite their weak connectivity, they elicit broad Kenyon cell activity but fail to support learning, revealing a circuit-level gate on learning. These results show that the mushroom body embeds a learning hierarchy in its connectivity architecture, prioritizing ethologically relevant odors while preserving coding capacity for diverse associations.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Our studies using Collaborative Cross (CC) mice show that genetic diversity influences the efficacy of BCG, the most widely used TB vaccine. BCG vaccination of CC042 mice reduces their lung bacillary burden and increases their survival following low-dose aerosol Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (MTBI), despite impaired T cell trafficking from a defective Itgal gene. Early protection requires the presence of T cells at the time of BCG vaccination but is not mediated by B cell or T cell recall responses following MTBI. In contrast, T cell depletion following BCG vaccination reduces survival after MTBI. Thus, CC042 mice reveal two phases of immunity induced by BCG that require T cells: an early phase mediated by innate responses and a later phase mediated by effector CD4 and/or CD8 T cells. Although measurement of vaccine-induced protection 30 days after MTBI is a standard measure of vaccine efficacy in the murine TB model, we find this time point is independent of memory T cells. Our results suggest that vaccine-elicited innate responses have a larger role in protection than previously considered.

Moreover, therapeutic shifting of the balance between CD4+ Foxp3- conventional (Tconv) and Treg towards Treg enhances survival in mice after MI. Owing to the species-specific differences in cardiac wound healing and remodelling after MI, it remains unclear whether these findings can be translated into novel immunotherapies for patients with MI. Therefore, we tested the feasibility of therapeutic Treg activation after MI in pigs whose cardiac wound healing and the composition of the immune system are very close to humans. To activate Treg, we treated pigs three days after MI induction with a superagonistic anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (mAb, CD28-SA; clone 4D12). To avoid induction of a cytokine release syndrome (CRS), we infused the CD28-SA at a low dose of 10 g/kg body weight. Low-dose CD28-SA treatment led to a local increase in porcine Treg among heart-infiltrating CD4+ T cells in comparison with the control mAb therapy (clone MOPC-21). Immunofluorescence histology showed that CD28-SA application particularly strengthened Treg accumulation in the infarct border zone. This was paralleled by a lower proportion of TNF-producing cells among cardiac monocytes and macrophages reflecting a shift away from inflammation and towards wound healing. Taken together, our findings in the pig MI model are the first to show that low-dose CD28-SA infusion is capable of ameliorating tissue inflammation in a species prone to CRS development after high-dose CD28-SA infusion. Moreover, the data highlight that therapeutically shifting the Treg/Tconv balance in MI patients might be feasible in order to enhance cardiac wound healing and prevent adverse remodelling.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

We found that following vaccination, neutrophils influx into secondary lymphoid organs and increase expression of T cell engaging/ inhibiting markers. When we depleted Tregs in neutrophil deficient mice at the time of vaccination, the opsonic activity of the antibodies and the ability of the sera to protect naive hosts against pneumococcal infection significantly increased compared to controls. Importantly, we examined responses following PCV administration in human female participants and found that PCV altered neutrophil phenotype and that in vitro co-culture of neutrophils with PBMCs at one week following vaccination resulted in lower percentage and proliferation of FOXP3+ T cells, showing the clinical relevance of this phenotype.

Dams were injected with the viral mimic, poly(I:C) or vehicle (VEH) for 24h at gestational days (GD) 12.5, 15.5, and 18.5. Placentae were stained with haematoxylin and eosin to assess junctional (JZ) and labyrinth (LZ) zone morphology. Fatty acid (FAT/CD36, FATP1/4, FABPpm) and folate (FR-, RFC1, PCFT, FR-{beta}) transporter expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and qPCR. Data were analysed by generalized linear mixed models (*p<0.05). HF diet reduced JZ and LZ area at GD12.5 while poly(I:C) increased interhaemal space, followed by compensatory expansion of JZ, LZ, and maternal blood spaces at GD18.5. At GD12.5, both stressors independently upregulated Fat/Cd36 mRNA and FR- immunoreactivity (ir), indicating an early adaptive response to maintain fetal nutrient supply, whereas HF diet decreased ir-PCFT expression. By GD15.5, HF diet downregulated ir-FR- but upregulated ir-PCFT, suggesting a shift in folate transport mechanisms over gestation. Viral infection selectively suppressed Rfc1 mRNA expression at GD18.5 and reduced placental and fetal weights across gestation. Maternal obesity and viral infection independently and synergistically disrupt placental morphology and nutrient transporter expression in a zone- and gestational age-specific manner.

To facilitate investigating the individual functions of such dyad modifications, we report HM-DyadCap. This method employs an evolved methyl-CpG-binding domain (MECP2 HM) for the direct capture and sequencing of DNA fragments containing the CpG dyad hmC/mC. Binding studies reveal a high discrimination of MECP2 HM against off-target dinucleotides. We conduct comparative mapping experiments for mESC genomes with HM-DyadCap, standard MethylCap employing wild type MECP2, as well as MeDIP and hMeDIP protocols. We find that MECP2 HM is blocked by hmC glucosylation, and conduct control enrichments with glucosylated genomes that indicate highly selective enrichment of hmC/mC dyads by MECP2 HM. Metagene profiles correlate hmC/mC marks with actively transcribed genes, and reveal global enrichment in gene bodies as well as depletion at transcription start sites.

To this end, we previously showed that sex and standard blood composition measures explain some variability in clot mechanics, but much remains unaccounted for. Ours and others' studies ignored the roles of fibrinogen and white blood cell (WBC) subtypes, which is surprising given their physiological importance. Objective: To develop a more complete understanding of what determines clots' mechanical properties, we now study the role of previously untested factors, namely fibrinogen levels and WBC subtypes, in addition to sex and standard blood composition measures. Methods: We drew blood from healthy young adults and prepared in vitro clot samples. Using pure shear and mode-I fracture tests, we measured clots' stiffness, fracture toughness, strength, and work to rupture. We then used linear regressions to quantify how blood composition influences clot mechanical properties, reporting R2 to assess explanatory power. Results: We found that fibrinogen is the strongest predictor of clot mechanical properties, positively correlating with all four metrics and achieving the highest average R2. For example, fibrinogen accounts for 70% of the variation in stiffness and 78% in fracture toughness. Among WBC subtypes, neutrophils positively correlate with strength and work to rupture, whereas eosinophils negatively correlate with strength. Conclusion: Our work shows that fibrinogen levels and WBC subtypes are previously untested but major determinants of in vitro clot mechanical properties.

Disruptions in this process can lead to functional impairment or system failure. In many cases, cells do not move randomly; instead, they migrate directionally in response to external cues, allowing them to perform essential biological functions. This directed movement is especially important in processes such as morphogenesis, cancer invasion, and wound healing. To unravel the complexities of directional cell migration, investigating natural guiding stimuli is crucial. Among these, electrical fields stand out as precise and physiologically relevant stimulus. Using a platform designed to apply programmable electric fields, the SCHEEPDOG device; we applied controlled electric field of varying intensities to keratocytes and quantitatively analyzed their migratory behavior. Our findings reveal that electric field stimulation not only induces robust directional migration but also enhances migration speed in an intensity-dependent manner. Additionally, cells initially moving in random directions gradually align with the field vector, with higher intensities accelerating the alignment. Intriguingly, while both speed and alignment time can be modulated through stimulation, the overall shape of migration trajectories remains unchanged. In other terms, for cells initially moving to the opposite direction of the field, the alignment is accompanied by making a turn and the size and shape of this turn is not affected by the magnitude of the electrical stimulation. Together, these results demonstrate that electrical stimulation can tune the speed and directional alignment of keratocyte migration without altering turning dynamics. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of electrotaxis and offers new insights into how biophysical cues regulate cell migration in both physiological and pathological contexts.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

This motivated our search for biomolecular forms of control capable of tuning this material property.

The model incorporates protrusive forces at the front, contractile stresses at the rear and sides, and spatially localized adhesive regions that undergo cyclic activation. While this baseline model reproduces persistent motion, it fails to capture the experimentally observed traction force patterns and cell morphology. Guided by new experiments visualizing myosin dynamics, we extended the model to include a localized contractile myosin patch positioned between the two adhesive regions. This modification yields cell shapes, speeds, and convergent traction patterns consistent with experimental measurements. The results demonstrate that a centrally positioned myosin patch is sufficient to generate the step-wise migration cycle and the characteristic convergent traction pattern of Dictyostelium cells, providing a mechanistic link between intracellular contractility, cytosolic flow, and force transmission during amoeboid motility.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

It is overexpressed in many cancers, where it drives genomic instability, phenocopies PTEN loss and hyperactivates the PI3K/AKT pathway, thereby promoting aggressive and therapy-resistant tumors. Methods: We developed an inducible Cep55 knockout (KO) mouse model as well as generated primary, immortalized (SV40), and transformed (E1A/Ras) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) for functional and proteomic assays. Tumorigenesis was studied using E1A/Ras MEF transplantation and a Pten-deficient genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM). Multi-omics apparatus including proteomics, and spatial transcriptomics, histopathology, immunobloting and functional assays were employed to elucidate underlying mechanisms. Findings were cross-validated using human cancer datasets. Results: Cep55 ablation remodeled the extracellular matrix (ECM), disrupted integrin and oncogenic signaling, reduced AKT/ERK activation, and induced stress pathways. Cep55 knockouts (KO) cells showed impaired proliferation, migration, invasion, and adhesion. In vivo, unlike the embryonic lethality observed in constitutive KOs, the inducible Cep55 deletion was well-tolerated in adult mice. Strikingly, tumors derived from Cep55-null EIA/RAS-transformed MEFs exhibited delayed onset and progression. In the genetically engineered cancer-prone mouse model, Cep55 deletion on a Pten-deficient background led to a greater than seven-fold increase in median survival. Spatial transcriptomics on cancerous tissues revealed that CEP55 regulates ECM remodeling, integrin expression, trafficking, and cell adhesion, supporting its critical role in tumor progression to metastasis. Conclusion:CEP55 is dispensable for adult homeostasis but essential for tumorigenesis, especially with PTEN loss. Its deletion suppresses transformation, delays tumor growth, and prolongs survival, supporting CEP55 as a therapeutic target in PTEN-deficient cancers.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

These modifications have been linked to human disease, including cancer, liver disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Herein, we present a mass spectrometry method for quantifying MGO-induced DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) in human cells. We prepared an isotope 15N213C6-dG-MGO-Lys internal standard to develop a quantitative LC-MS/MS method for detecting and quantifying the formation and repair of dG-MGO-Lys DPCs in cells. Genomic DNA was extracted, subjected to sequential protease and nuclease digestion, purified by offline HPLC, and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The method's standard curve showed a strong linear relationship across a concentration range of 10-1000 fmol (R2 = 0.9994). The method achieved limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 10 and 20 fmol, respectively. Inhibition of proteasome and SPRTN activity revealed that SPRTN functions as a predominant proteolytic enzyme in MGO DPC repair. Overall, this analytical approach can offer valuable insights into the relevance of DPCs in diseases linked to elevated MGO levels.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Alterations in transit time through the GI tract can reveal abnormalities such as delayed gastric emptying and provide critical insights into nutrient absorption dynamics. This information is particularly valuable for optimizing dietary interventions, managing metabolic conditions such as diabetes, and improving personalized nutrition strategies. Methods for measuring the oral to cecal transit time (OCTT) in murine models have significant limitations. We demonstrate a non-invasive approach in freely-moving non-anesthetized mice which quantifies the microbial digestion of the non-nutritive sweetener mannitol to CO2. We monitor cage air for the production of 13CO2 from 13C-enriched mannitol using Off-Axis Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy integrated with multiplexes indirect calorimetry. With this approach, we find mannitol oxidation is absent in mice following commensal depletion of the microbiota. In mice with conventional microbiota, the peak 13C-mannitol oxidation occurs proximal to the mouse cecum, allowing the quantitation of OCTT in mice. By tracking the output of 13CO2, this method provides highly granular, real-time data. We detect delayed OCTT with the use of pharmacological transit-altering compounds loperamide, a gut restricted opioid receptor agonist and also semaglutide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist.

Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) both represses Mdm2 transcription and co-activates p53 targets (p21 and PUMA), yet these dual roles have not been quantified within a unified framework. We build a mechanistic model that couples a biologically calibrated stress scale (S) and STAT1 activity ({Sigma}) to the canonical p53--Mdm2 core and to downstream p21 and PUMA modules. Key processes are not described by fixed parameters but by explicit functions of S, allowing the model to self-adjust across stress levels without manual re-fitting. This formulation ensures that oscillatory, damped, or plateau responses naturally emerge by varying S alone. STAT1 acts as a dynamical gain on the core (controlling mean level, pulse amplitude, and duration) and as a transcriptional co-activator scaling promoter strengths. Bifurcation analysis reveals a two-dimensional Hopf region in the (S,{Sigma} ) plane; increasing {Sigma} shifts this region to higher S and progressively narrows it, ultimately quenching oscillations at large {Sigma}. Simulations of a generic cell with time-varying S and {Sigma}, combined with a two-stage decision rule (early transient detection followed by stationary readout), map p53 dynamics to fate: sustained moderate oscillations align with arrest, damped intermediate responses with senescence, and strongly damped high plateaus with apoptosis. The model reproduces cell fate distributions reported in literature for different cell lines (MCF-7, HCT116, U2OS) without kinetic parameter re-fitting, and highlights cell-type-specific sensitivity to p21 versus PUMA. Our framework identifies STAT1 as a tunable amplifier and oscillation quencher of the stress-responsive p53 network, providing testable dynamics-based predictions for fate control.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigated how sensory events that initiate or terminate locomotion, structure CA1 population codes and how these codes reorganize across sensory-driven locomotion, spontaneous locomotion, and forced immobility. Using two-photon calcium imaging in head-fixed Thy1-GCaMP mice (n = 5) performing the air-induced running task on a non-motorized conveyor belt, we examined neuronal firing-rate modulation across a series of behavioral configurations designed to probe distinct forms of locomotion-in-place. In the No-Brake (locomotion-permitted) condition, the belt rotated freely, allowing animals to execute full cyclic limb movements in response to air stimulation. In the Brake (immobility) condition, the belt was fixed, restricting movement to partial or attempted locomotor motions. Firing-rate modulation with respect to time, distance, and speed was quantified using linear (Pearson correlation) and nonlinear (mutual information) metrics under permutation testing in the natural reference domains. Behaviorally, air stimuli produced faster, sustained running during air-on and more variable, self-paced movement during air-off. Neurally, a larger fraction of CA1 cells was active and significantly modulated during air-off. Within the modulated set, singularly tuned cells (time, distance, or speed) predominated over mixed-tuned cells, and speed-modulated cells peaked earlier after stimulus onset or offset than time- or distance-modulated cells. Under Brake, CA1 activity was predominantly singularly tuned to time or movement-in-place, with stronger movement modulation and engagement post-stimulation. Despite substantial single-cell turnover across configurations and phases, population-level analyses revealed a coherent, air-phase-locked organization and distinct movement-related populations across Brake and No-Brake conditions.

MECP2 negatively regulates TET3 activity, as demonstrated in functional assays and by inverse hmC patterns in MECP2- and TET3-deficient neurons.

Recent studies have demonstrated heterogeneous and modular NA release in distinct brain regions and highlighted its spatiotemporal dynamics across the neocortex. However, the spatiotemporal specificity of NA release at fine scales within a single brain region remains unclear, and it has not been reported whether the release patterns evolve functionally throughout prolonged learning processes such as motor skill acquisition. Here, by employing in vivo two-photon imaging with various genetically encoded NA sensors, we reveal that behavior-induced NA release in the primary motor cortex (M1) is spatially heterogeneous at the scale of local microcircuitry. Over the course of learning, the release pattern is locally refined, achieving consistent spatial precision within M1. Intriguingly, pharmacological manipulations that disrupt the spatial specificity also alter local neurons activity and representations. Furthermore, LC-NA axonal calcium imaging uncovered two distinct temporal activity patterns, in which non-behavior-related rapid axonal activity (sub-second duration events) profoundly affect the temporally precise behavior-induced persistent axonal activity (seconds duration events). Closed-loop optogenetic manipulations that bi-directionally modulate non-behavior-related rapid events directly impacted the learning process. Together, our results provide novel insights into the temporal dynamics of NA release at fine spatial scales within one brain region and underscore the critical role of local NA specificity in regulating circuit plasticity during motor skill acquisition.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

We found a dynamic shift in SNpr activity during the decision process. Before choice, SNpr activity encoded the optimal selection regardless of the eventual action taken, representing the action and value of the optimal choice even when the non-optimal target was ultimately selected. During choice, the SNpr shifted to code the actual selection made by the monkey. This pattern was reinforced by trials with suboptimal choices, revealing a clear transition in SNpr coding from representing the abstract value of the optimal selection to encoding the chosen action, thus suggesting a neural mechanism that transforms value representations into concrete decisions.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

We found that crossmodal violations elicit temporally sustained cortical responses which diverge from the transient, localised dynamics observed for unimodal prediction errors. Temporal decoding revealed that crossmodal effects maintain shared prolonged neural representations, suggestive of supramodal integration across all levels of cortical processing. Computational modelling further demonstrated that crossmodal prediction errors reorganize effective connectivity within and between sensory hierarchies, engaging distinct early cortical pathways depending on the sensory combination.

However, whether the low D2 receptor levels represent a predisposing factor or a consequence of obesity, and how these processes are mechanistically linked, remains unclear. Here, we directly tested this causal relationship by selectively reducing D2 receptor density in striatal neurons. Male, but not female, mice with a low density of striatal D2 receptors consumed more food, gained more weight, and developed metabolic features of peripheral insulin resistance despite being maintained on standard chow. Motivational deficits preceded weight gain, manifesting as delayed circadian locomotor onset, reduced physical activity, and diminished effort to obtain food. In the brain, male mice with low D2 receptor density showed reduced dopamine release capacity and age-dependent alterations in brain insulin sensitivity. Prior to weight gain, brain insulin responses were blunted compared to those of controls, in which insulin potentiates dopamine release and enhances striatal acetylcholine signaling. Once overweight, however, these mice exhibited brain insulin hypersensitivity, with insulin strongly restoring dopamine release capacity. Together, these findings demonstrate that low striatal D2 receptor density predisposes male mice to an obesity-like phenotype through early dopaminergic dysfunction that precedes weight gain and is later compensated by insulin hypersensitivity in the brain.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

In rodents, the pontine tegmentum contains an REM sleep centre, the sublaterodorsal nucleus (SLD), which expresses corticotropin-releasing hormone binding protein (CRHBP). While the involvement of brainstem pathophysiology is thus implicated in iRBD, its solid evidence remains scarce in humans due to the difficulty in identifying small brainstem nuclei with conventional MRI technology alone. Here, we aimed to detect tegmental atrophy in iRBD with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis combined with a novel human brainstem atlas. Structural MRIs from 98 patients with iRBD and 114 controls were analysed to investigate grey matter volume (GMV) using VBM. Our unique approach involved detailed assessments of the VBM results, guided by a high-resolution MRI-based atlas of the human brainstem. This brainstem atlas was founded on ex vivo MRI of 10 postmortem human specimens. We validated it with CRHBP immunostaining, which aided in identifying putative REM sleep-regulating nuclei in humans. We applied this brainstem atlas to identify atrophy in specific brainstem regions in iRBD and correlate their volumes with clinical measures, including autonomic functions. VBM revealed a focal cluster of grey matter atrophy in the dorsal pontine tegmentum of iRBD patients, including the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, ventral part (LDTgV) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PTg). Our atlas-based analysis confirmed the LDTgV as the site of most conspicuous atrophy, revealing a significant volume reduction in iRBD patients compared to controls with a moderate effect size (Cohen's d = 0.46, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.019). Furthermore, greater atrophy in the LDTgV and the PTg was associated with more severe autonomic dysfunction as measured by Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease-Autonomic dysfunction (SCOPA-AUT) scores (partial r = -0.237, p = 0.019 and partial r = -0.236, p = 0.019, respectively). Histological analysis confirmed that the LDTgV is selectively enriched with CRHBP-positive neurons, a putative marker for REM sleep-on neurons. We provided novel evidence for the involvement of LDTgV, the putative human homolog of the murine SLD, in iRBD.

This maturation program is initiated by critical levels of RBFOX2 that facilitate self-splicing at mutually exclusive exons encoding early and late isoforms with distinct functional roles. In heterozygous CMs, self-splicing is disrupted, which skews isoform ratios and generates a dominant-negative caused by exon co-inclusion. Finally, we demonstrate that overexpression of correctly spliced ACTN2 rescues heterozygous, but not null, phenotypes by restoring contractility, which triggers a mechanosensing feedback loop involving upregulation of RBFOX2 from the wildtype allele and transcriptome maturation.

To achieve this, species distribution models (SDMs) typically use a range of variables to determine the suitability of an area to a given species, which enables scientists to produce species distribution maps. Most SDMs are statistically limited in the number of predictors they can take into account, which leads to using summary variables such as temperature yearly average or bathymetry extrema. Deep-learning-based SDMs have been proposed to tackle this limitation by bringing powerful implicit feature extractors. Here, we describe a new model to advance the adaptation of such Deep-SDMs to marine environments and take advantage of the knowledge of the environmental seascape around surveyed points.

Yet, the ecological mechanisms underlying such variation remain often unknown. Using a multiyear dataset from captive and wild precocial Ruffs Calidris pugnax, we show that poorer survival and later fledging of males relative to females result in a female biased sex ratio of the fledgling population. Both sex-specific survival and maturation time contributed equally to an increasing sex ratio bias from hatching to fledging in this sexually dimorphic bird. On average, juvenile females fledged three days earlier than males due to expedited wing development, despite the higher absolute rate of wing growth in males. We argue that sex differences in growth, maturation, and offspring survival are likely the result of strong pre-sexual selection on males to achieve dominance and may help to enforce the Darwinian sex roles observed in this species.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

N.", "abstract": "Trehalose is a widely prevalent, abundant disaccharide that acts as a cellular stress protectant, and functions as an energy source that enters central carbon metabolism when broken down. The evolution and distribution of trehalose breakdown pathways across kingdoms of life have not been studied, and therefore the ability of different organisms to consume trehalose as a carbon source is unknown. In this study, we build a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the four known trehalose breakdown pathways - trehalase (acid, neutral, glycosyl hydrolase 15), trehalose phosphorylases (TP, treP), and trehalose specific phosphotransferases (PTS), by studying their distributions across ~4000 prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Our study suggests the presence of trehalase in the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA), and reveals near-universal presence of trehalase in eukaryotes, except in all birds where trehalase was lost in the first bird ancestor. Fungi alone retain additional trehalose phosphorylases (TP) in addition to trehalase. In contrast, trehalose breakdown in prokaryotes is highly sporadic but can occur via multiple, independently evolved pathways, including trehalase, the trehalose-specific PTS and trehalose phosphorylase. Finally, we observe that a subset of fast-growing Gammaproteobacteria retain the trehalose specific PTS, the loss of which reduces growth in Escherichia coli. Overall, our findings uncover the evolutionary landscape of trehalose breakdown, and use of this versatile disaccharide as an energy reserve in different kingdoms of life.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

During collective predator vigilance, individuals often initiate evasive action based on social cues - such as the escape behaviour of others - before detecting threats themselves. Yet these cues can be ambiguous or misleading, leading to costly false alarms. Gaze following, a key socio-cognitive skill widespread across species, may reduce this ambiguity by allowing individuals to localize threats with minimal effort and avoid unnecessary escapes. Although this vigilance function has long been hypothesized, direct evidence is lacking. Here we show that pigeons foraging in flocks detect a predator and socially transmit its location rapidly via gaze following, before any escape behaviour occurs. In experiments simulating predator attacks, we reconstructed predator-oriented gaze using high-resolution posture tracking and modelled social transmission with dynamic multi-network Bayesian models. Comparing models based on distinct social cues, we found that pigeons responded selectively to conspecific gaze toward the predator, rather than locomotion, head-up vigilance, or gaze elsewhere. Analyses of network structure further revealed that this transmission occurs through visually connected networks, particularly via peripheral rather than foveal vision. While individuals occasionally followed gaze to non-threatening locations, flocks reliably converged on the actual threat. These findings uncover a previously undocumented, cognition-based mechanism of collective detection. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that gaze following serves an adaptive function in survival contexts, illustrating how individual-level cognition and group-level dynamics interact to the adaptive value of group living.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Serial dependence has been robustly demonstrated across a broad spectrum of visual features, ranging from low-level attributes, such as orientation and color, to high-level representations, including facial identity. To further understand this dependency, the present study investigated the presence of serial dependence in judgments of relative proportions within visual stimuli. Participants completed a two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) task involving stimuli composed of two symbols. These symbols differed only in brightness in Experiment~1 and only in shape in Experiment~2. Participants were required to judge which symbol occupied the larger proportion. The results revealed a systematic bias in the participants' responses. Specifically, Experiment~1 yielded a repulsive bias (negative serial dependence), where current judgments shifted away from the proportion observed in the preceding trial. Conversely, Experiment~2 exhibited an attractive bias (positive serial dependence), pulling current judgments toward the preceding proportion. Furthermore, the magnitude and direction of this serial dependence appeared to be modulated by both the participants' confidence in their judgments and the feature similarity between successive stimuli. These findings suggest that the perception of proportion has serial dependence and extend the generality of this phenomenon to higher-level visual summary statistics.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Behavioral change and individual plasticity are generally hypothesized to be the key to adapting to these challenges. One commonly observed behavioral change is higher observed aggression levels in urban animals, perhaps because anthropogenic noise disrupts effective acoustic communication during conflicts, leading to greater use of physical aggression. We investigated the hypothesis that urban noise drives aggression by performing repeated simulated territorial intrusion experiments on rural and urban chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs). We expected urban chaffinches to be more aggressive, change their aggression levels more between trials, and for aggression to increase with noise levels, irrespective of the habitat. We found that while aggression didn't differ between habitats in the initial trial, rural chaffinches decreased their aggression level in the second trial and thus were less aggressive than the urban chaffinches, who did not change their response. That is, urban birds were less flexible in responding to an intruder than rural birds, contrary to previous findings in other songbirds. Moreover, there was an increase in aggression with increasing noise levels, irrespective of the habitat. Given our small sample size and lack of spatial replicates, our results should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, as a lack of flexibility in aggression is potentially costly, our results highlight the importance of studying the plasticity in aggressive behavior in human-impacted landscapes.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Dysfunctional metabolism in type-2 diabetes or obesity is associated with gut dysbiosis, causing release of gut microbial endotoxins like lipopolysaccharides (LPS) into the liver via portal circulation also known as gut-liver axis. Endotoxins or LPS signals metabolic changes in the liver initiating steatosis via gut-liver axis. Various pre-clinical models have been studied to evaluate the role of fermented food derived bioactive compounds, thus, preventing the process of steatosis. Among them exopolysaccharides (EPS), as a part of fermented foods have been reported to produce metabolites as a result of gut microbial fermentation, providing liver with health benefits in the form of hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects. In the present study, we have evaluated the role of a noble EPS or G (glucan) in the condition of liver steatosis using cell culture model of gut-liver axis by co-culturing Caco-2 and HepG2 cells in transwell culture dishes. LPS was used as an agonist to mimic gut dysbiosis in caco-2 cells in the upper chamber, with or without pre-treatment of G. HepG2 cells cultured in lower chamber were extracted for intracellular metabolites to be analyzed by LC-Q-TOF. The global metabolomic profiles of LPS+G+ and LPS+ treated cells were compared. The primary target of G showed its role in cholesterol and primary bile acid metabolism along with changes in nucleotide, vitamins and branched chain aminoacid metabolites helpful in reducing fatty liver. Future studies with this glucan using targeted metabolomics could confirm biomarkers of therapeutic intervention of steatosis and could be translated into healthy food products with health benefits especially to the liver.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

This organization may further depend on environmental conditions. To study it, a range of methods are available. Cryo-electron tomography offers the highest resolution but is limited in throughput, while super-resolution fluorescence techniques such as Airyscan and structured illumination microscopy provide improved resolution but cannot resolve individual thylakoid membranes. To expand this toolbox, we applied cryo-Expansion Microscopy (cryo-ExM) to dark-adapted Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells.

By expanding cells 5.5-fold, we resolved individual thylakoid membranes in intact cells using confocal microscopy.

Quantitative analysis of fluorescence covariance revealed a high degree of colocalization among PSI, PSII and PBS, providing no evidence for microdomains under dark-adapted conditions. PBS was excluded only from the neck region between dividing cells, while PSI, PSII and PBS were otherwise distributed throughout the thylakoid membrane.

Their functions rely on their innate ability to interact with membranes dynamically in response to rapidly changing cellular conditions. This membrane recruitment may occur via high-affinity interactions with specific lipids or transient, low-affinity membrane interactions. These weak and dynamic interactions, which are critical regulators of protein function, are challenging to capture. Taking Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase essential for B cell activation, as an example, we demonstrate a native mass spectrometry (nMS) platform to understand the recruitment of PMPs by directly studying them from lipid bilayers customized to target membranes. Our data demonstrate that BTK recognizes phosphatidylserine (PS) through sites distinct from phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-phosphate (PIP3) binding. We show that PS-bound BTK retains PIP3 binding simultaneously via high-affinity sites, exhibiting PIP3-independent basal membrane recruitment of BTK. Biochemical assays show that this PS-mediated recruitment sensitizes BTK to PIP3-mediated activation under near-physiological concentrations of PIP3. Thus, we propose a two-step model for BTK membrane recruitment and activation. A low-affinity interaction with high-copy-number PS enables plasma membrane recruitment of BTK and increases its membrane-bound concentration. Upon B-cell activation, this pre-recruited, membrane-bound BTK population localizes to PIP3-rich domains through electrostatic gliding along the membrane driven by low-affinity PS and high-affinity PIP3 binding. This indicates a cooperative mechanism in which PS can amplify B-cell signaling through increased membrane-bound BTK concentration. Our work demonstrates a general model of PH-domain-containing protein regulation by weak protein-lipid interactions, which can be extended to many other PMPs.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

In this study, we established a reproducible protocol for the production and dynamic culture of uniformly sized GB spheroids using the Celvivo Clinostar system. Our spheroids recapitulated the heterogeneous structure of GB and expressed ligands for NK cell receptors at levels distinct from those observed in corresponding GB cell lines in standard culture, implicating altered sensitivity of GB cells to NK cells in dynamic 3D cultures. GB-NK cell crosstalk was GB cell type dependent and the ability of NK cells to infiltrate GB did not necessarily correlate with their cytotoxicity against GB cells.

We developed an eco-evolutionary model of community assembly that incorporates interaction-driven population dynamics and evolutionary processes, including speciation and the inheritance of interactions, to unveil the mechanisms of generation and maintenance of biodiversity in complex species interaction networks. Importantly, our model unpicks the effects of selection of interaction types from those of inheritance by comparing evolutionary assembly with assembly by invasion under different combinations of interaction types. We found that a cost-benefit balance of accumulating interactions separates communities into two distinct types. Interactions with weak benefits for the partners involved produce communities with sparse species interaction networks dominated by competition. Strongly beneficial interactions, on the other hand, give rise to highly mutualistic, more connected communities. Mutualism, driven by both selection and inheritance, facilitates the emergence of large yet stable communities with increased complexity.

A key approach to pooling samples while maintaining unambiguous sample identification is to employ DNA barcoding, which assigns each specimen a unique nucleotide (index) sequence. For barcoding in droplets and microwells, one widely used approach is to randomly seed a unique oligo-coated bead into each compartment. Synthesis of oligonucleotide-coated beads (e.g., split-pooling) is exceptionally intensive and random seeding can result in errors. As an alternative, we present deterministic, aqueous barcoding of 512 arrayed microwells using a multi-layer, vacuum-driven microfluidic network. To uniquely barcode each of the 512 microwells, the oligonucleotide solutions are designed using a Combinatorial Dual Indexing (i5, i7) scheme with the deterministic loading. Deterministic loading of the solutions is achieved by sequentially mating two bifurcated and complementary microchannel-network layers to the microwell array. Vacuum-assisted flow and dead-end channel design yields uniform barcode patterning in the microwell array (~20% CV), reasonable barcode loading times (30 - 40 min per one step), and reduced reagent use (~ 8-16 uL at 25 uM oligos vs. 10-50 uL at 100 uM for bead systems). Cross-contamination occurred in ~4% of the microwells, well within the acceptable range. Following DNA barcode delivery, on-chip PCR of nuclear DNA from a breast cancer cell line having the characteristics of the differentiated mammary epithelium (MCF7) was successfully performed, with off-chip quality control of the amplified breast cancer DNA. Overall, we describe a deterministic and bead-free DNA barcoding strategy for efficient barcoding of widely used microwell arrays.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

This study establishes a scalable and accessible biofabrication method that combines the precision of a commercial 3D bioprinter with the physicochemical principles of molecular crowding. Using an acidic collagen solution in combination with a hypertonic polyethylene glycol (PEG) bath, we systematically investigate how modulating pulling speed and nozzle diameter dictates the final filament properties. Our results demonstrate that faster pulling speeds and smaller nozzle diameters produce thinner, more densely packed filaments. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and polarised light microscopy reveal a tuneable transition in surface morphology, from a disordered isotropic state to a highly ordered phase, quantitatively confirmed by a sharp increase in birefringence. Critically, we demonstrate the preservation of collagen's native, periodic 66 nm d-banding, an essential motif for cell interaction. This structural refinement translates to a dramatic enhancement of mechanical performance, with the strongest filaments achieving an ultimate tensile strength of 0.64 GPa and a Young's modulus of 8.9 GPa, values that surpass native tendon. Furthermore, the fabricated filaments are highly biocompatible and bio-instructive, promoting robust alignment and elongation of mesenchymal stem cells. This work provides a direct link between bioprocess parameters and the resulting hierarchical structure, offering a versatile platform for fabricating high performance, biomimetic materials for regenerative medicine.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

We introduce a patch-centric framework that predicts epitopes directly on antigen structures. Each surface \"patch\" is defined as a triad of neighboring residues, capturing the smallest local unit that encodes both shape and chemistry. We evaluate two classifiers: (i) a protein language model (PLM) approach that averages ESM-2 embeddings over each triad and scores them with a small multilayer perceptron, and (ii) a convolutional baseline that consumes a hand-crafted 15x20 feature matrix summarizing amino-acid identity, secondary structure, solvent accessibility, and shape index. Trained with five-fold cross-validation on 1,151 AbDb antibody-antigen complexes, the PLM model markedly outperforms the CNN at the patch level (e.g., F1{approx}0.986, ROC-AUC{approx}0.998).

For the first time, we employed a chemogenetic approach (DREADDs) to selectively and temporally activate Gq coupled GPCR signaling in myeloid cells to examine its effect on islet function. Our findings reveal that acute Gq activation in islet resident macrophages impaired glucose stimulated insulin secretion, uncovering a previously unrecognized immune endocrine axis. Conversely, myeloid-specific Gq deletion improves systemic glucose homeostasis, underscoring the physiological relevance of this pathway. Mechanistic analysis revealed that Gq activation in macrophages stimulates AMPK signaling and drives the secretion of sphingolipids. These lipids suppress insulin secretion and introduce a new mechanism for immune islet communication, extending beyond traditional cytokine-based models. We further identify the lipid-sensing receptor GPR18 as an upstream activator of the Gq AMPK pathway in macrophages. GPR18 stimulation recapitulated the Gq-dependent sphingolipid secretion and {beta} cell inhibitory phenotype, which was abolished in myeloid Gq deficient mice. Collectively, these findings establish a mechanistic framework whereby macrophage Gq signaling integrates lipid sensing and metabolic stress to modulate {beta} cell function.

We found that action timing is predictable from neural activity, up to several seconds before action initiation, across all eight brain areas. This predictive activity reflects a deterministic drive whose initial value and rate vary trial-by-trial, and whose rate accelerates within trials.

However, the developmental trajectories of synovial tissue macrophage (STM) subsets in humans remain poorly understood, due in part to the lack of models that faithfully replicate synovial tissue niches. This hinders the exploration of the therapeutic potential of targeting specific synovial myeloid cell clusters. Using multi-omics analyses of synovial tissue from an allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipient, we show that joint-specific tissue-resident STM subsets, including both health- and disease-associated clusters, can derive from peripheral blood monocytes. Analysis of embryonic synovial joints revealed that macrophage localization and maturation in the joints are preceded by local stromal niche specialisation, indicating that synovial fibroblasts (FLS) provide tissue-specific instructive cues to STM precursors. To elucidate human STM developmental trajectories, we established a SNP-based fate-tracking human synovial organoid system by embedding distinct blood-derived myeloid precursors, together with FLS clusters from RA synovial biopsies and endothelial cells, into 3D structures. These organoids reproduced key synovial tissue features, including lining and sublining architecture and stromal-myeloid cell cluster composition. Importantly, they supported differentiation of all resident STM subsets: homeostatic lining TREM2pos macrophages, their pathogenic TREM2lowSPP1pos counterparts that characterize the RA hyperplastic lining, and both homeostatic and RA-associated perivascular LYVE1pos STM clusters, all traced to monocytic precursors. In summary, we show that development of STM subsets is driven by fibroblast-conditioned spatial niches.

The interfacial processes governing this transition from strong crystal to tough composite remain unclear, suggesting that the organic interfaces between crystals, rather than crystal defects, control the macroscopic mechanical behaviour. We systematise the investigation of this phenomenon by employing Molecular Dynamics simulations, which reproduce experimental elastic constants within 5%. We characterise three limiting interface compositions: dry twin aragonite boundaries, hydrated protein-mediated interfaces, and water interfaces - by applying tensile and shear loading and quantifying their mechanical competence using a three-dimensional failure criterion. Interface composition determines the mechanical hierarchy, spanning nearly an order of magnitude in strength. Dry twin boundaries provide the highest strength, reaching up to 6.5 GPa, through direct crystalline bonding. Conversely, protein mediated interfaces exhibit the lowest strength (0.5-0.7 GPa) but demonstrate high damage tolerance. Water-mediated hydrogen-bonding networks enable this progressive failure, dissipating energy through sequential bond rupture and reformation rather than catastrophic separation. Water interfaces show thickness-dependent compliance: thin layers (<5 A) retain partial electrostatic coupling (>3 GPa), while thick layers allow controlled sliding (~0.8 GPa). These quantitative structure-property relationships provide transferable parameters for multiscale coral modelling, enabling researchers to bridge atomistic mechanisms with mesoscale mechanical response.

A promising candidate class for new antibiotics are antimicrobial peptides, showing lower tendency to induce antibiotic resistance. High-throughput in silico strategies for candidate mining, such as generative deep learning algorithms, have become popular over the last few years and offer novel ways for peptide discovery. Methods: This study presents a comparative analysis of contemporary deep learning models' generative performance for generating novel antimicrobial peptides. The models examined include Variational Auto-Encoders, a Wasserstein Auto-Encoder, a Recurrent Neural Network and a Language Model. The primary focus of this study is the systematic comparison and evaluation of various methods and sampling options to identify the most suitable model and sampling strategy combination for different use cases. Results: The findings demonstrate the models' capacity to generate peptide sequences exhibiting analogous properties to those of naturally occurring active peptides, which are utilized for model training while featuring an appropriate degree of sequence diversity. Auto-encoder-based models, particularly the Wasserstein auto-encoder, have generated novel and remarkably diverse sequences compared to recurrent neural networks and language models. This model category exhibits a propensity to prioritize the frequencies of individual amino acids during the learning process, in contrast to variational auto-encoders. Furthermore, latent space models have been shown to possess the capacity to utilize diverse methodologies for generating novel peptides. However, it is imperative to note that these sampling strategies are not universally advantageous or disadvantageous; their optimal selection is contingent on the specificities of each individual use case. Conclusion: The present study investigates the strengths and weaknesses of various generative models for antimicrobial peptides and suggests which model and sampling strategy combination should be favoured for specific individual applications.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

On the other hand, the chloroplast and growth defects observed in dxo1 null mutants appear linked to the presence of a serine-rich domain at its N-terminus.

Its role in immunity has received particular attention due to the autoimmunity phenotype observed in the cngc2/dnd1 knockout mutants. Interestingly, despite this hyperactivation of immunity, the mutant also exhibits impaired hypersensitive cell death - a hallmark of effector-triggered immunity (ETI - as well as reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and diminished Ca2+ influx in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as the bacterial flagellin peptide flg22. These contradictory phenotypes highlight the complex biological functions of CNGC2. To date, most studies have focused on loss-of-function mutants. In this study, we performed a detailed characterization of CNGC2 overexpression lines to gain deeper insight into its role in immunity. Remarkably, overexpression of CNGC2 led to heightened susceptibility to two taxonomically distinct pathogens, despite the plants displaying wild-type morphology. Overexpression of CNGC2 rescued several cngc2 mutant phenotypes, including morphological defects and delayed flowering, yet these plants were also hypersensitive to elevated external Ca2+ levels. Furthermore, they exhibited attenuated responses to flg22, suggesting that CNGC2 does not act as a simple positive or negative regulator of immunity. Our findings reveal an essential role for CNGC2 where a balanced expression level is critical for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis between the apoplast and cytosol, thereby influencing the generation of Ca2+ signals essential for immune responses.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Although confined to organelles, it is directed by nuclear-encoded PLS-type pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, each typically recognizing a specific RNA target. While many editing sites are functionally neutral, edits at cryptic start and internal stop codons have been implicated in modulating organellar gene expression. Ferns, and some lycophytes,are unique among vascular plants in exhibiting both C-to-U and U-to-C editing, making them valuable for studying the evolution of both forms. Here, we examine chloroplast RNA editing in four Schizaeales species (Schizaea dichotoma, Actinostachys digitata, Anemia phyllitidis, Lygodium microphyllum), two of which possess non-photosynthetic gametophytes, providing a natural contrast with fully photosynthetic relatives. Despite extensive plastome reduction, including loss of the ndh suite and, in Actinostachys, all chl genes, Schizaea and Actinostachys exhibit dramatically elevated numbers of C-to-U edits. Genes evolving under relaxed selection accumulate more editing sites, and editing abundance per gene correlates with the magnitude of relaxed constraint, suggesting relaxed selection promotes edit proliferation. S. dichotoma and A. digitata also show expansion of the chloroplast inverted repeat (IR), and genes translocated into the IR exhibit reduced substitution rates and higher editing densities, indicating that IR expansion slows the loss of edits. Finally, annotation of PPR proteins revealed few full-length editing factors, consistent with catalytic domains assembling in trans and highlighting the modular nature of the fern editosome.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

One brain area that takes part in controlling which experiences are remembered is the amygdala, but the mechanisms by which it does so remain poorly understood. Here we examined single-neuron activity and local field potentials as human participants performed recognition memory tasks with visual stimuli. Category-selective amygdala neurons exhibited elevated firing rates during encoding of later remembered items versus forgotten items. This subsequent memory effect was restricted to images of the preferred category of a given cell, was stronger and appeared earlier in the amygdala compared to the hippocampus, and did not depend on the valence and arousal of the stimuli. In contrast, category selective cells immediately upstream in the ventral temporal cortex did not exhibit a subsequent memory effect, highlighting specificity to the amygdala. Successful memory formation was accompanied by enhanced spike-field coherence between the activity of category cells in the amygdala and hippocampal field potentials. These findings, replicated in two large independent datasets with two different tasks, demonstrate that recruitment of stimulus-specific amygdala representations predicts episodic memory formation, particularly in the right amygdala. This data suggests category cells in the right amygdala as a cellular target for interventions to treat memory disorders in humans.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

The right insular cortex is known to play a key role in these processes, yet its precise functional contribution remains unclear. Transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) is currently one of the only non-invasive neuromodulation techniques capable of safely and precisely modulating the activity of deep brain structures such as the insula. Objective: This study used TUS to causally investigate the respective roles of the anterior and posterior insula in urge and action control during a blink suppression task. Methods: Twenty healthy adults underwent three TUS sessions targeting the right anterior insula, posterior insula, and posterior ventricle (control site) in a within-subject, crossover design. Behavioural outcomes included blink counts and urge ratings. Additionally, voxel-based correlations were conducted to further estimate the role of each reached area with acoustic stimulation, allowing for a better mechanical understanding. Results: TUS of the anterior insula induced a clear and acute increase in blink frequency without altering urge, reinforced by voxel-based analyses, confirming its role in voluntary action control. Posterior insula stimulation induced delayed increases in both blinks and urge, which are essentially explained by an involuntary stimulation of the right inferior frontal gyrus. Ventricular stimulation unexpectedly reduced blink frequency during the stimulation only, correlated with acoustic energy delivered within the posterior internal capsule. No significant side effects or temperature rises were observed. Conclusions: These findings provide the first causal evidence that TUS can modulate the two main features of TS: premonitory urge and action control. Distinct effects across targets highlight the anterior insula's critical role in action control and suggest the internal capsule as a potential therapeutic target for TS.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

The mechanism that controls NLRP3 functioning in the context of non-communicable diseases lacking overt microbial infections remains debated. Here, we show that chronic exposure to atherosclerosis-associated oxidized phospholipids (oxPLs) simultaneously primes and activates NLRP3 independently of microbial cues. Mechanistically, chronic exposure to host-derived oxPLs activate the transcription factor NRF2, which is necessary and sufficient to prime and activate NLRP3 in a PAMP-independent manner. NRF2 chronic activation drives oxidized mitochondrial DNA to activate NLRP3. Ex vivo analyses of atherosclerotic plaques in mice and humans identify a population of monocytes-derived macrophages which activates NRF2 and expresses IL-1{beta}.

We compared the results of our model to sequence variation of the three tandemly arrayed HEAVY METAL ATPase 4 (HMA4) gene copies of Arabidopsis halleri, which are known to undergo IGC. However, rate and efficacy of IGC vary within genes, resulting in a mosaic pattern of divergence.

Here, we focus on determining how the Paired-like homeodomain factors gain DNA binding specificity by cooperatively binding palindromic sites spaced three base pairs apart (P3 site). Through structural, biochemical, and bioinformatic approaches, we define 11 rules that describe homeodomain residues that are critical, permissive, and inhibitory to cooperativity on the P3 site. Applying these rules, we successfully altered the cooperative behavior of Paired-like factors, identified residues that prevent the related Antennapedia class of homeodomains from binding cooperatively, and predict that thirty-eight disease-associated missense variants across ten Paired-like proteins alter cooperativity. Using quantitative DNA binding assays, we confirmed eleven of twelve of these disease-associated variants impact cooperativity but not DNA binding affinity. These findings reveal the importance of cooperativity in defining DNA binding specificity and highlight how missense variants associated with as many as fifteen different diseases can selectively disrupt cooperative DNA binding.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

In Drosophila melanogaster, the taste receptor Alka mediates alkaline food sensing, but the structural and functional mechanisms of Alka-mediated high-pH sensation have remained unclear. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of Alka at near-atomic resolution. Alka assembles into a homopentamer and undergoes conformational changes between neutral and alkaline pH conditions. At nearly neutral conditions, a lysine residue (K229) in the channel activation domain forms a stabilizing salt bridge, maintaining the channel in a closed state. Under alkaline conditions, deprotonation of the K229 side chain disrupts this interaction, resulting in channel opening. Functional studies in heterologous cells and intact flies show that mutation of K229 significantly impairs alkaline pH-dependent Alka activation, demonstrating its essential role in pH sensing. Our findings uncover a previously unrecognized structural mechanism underlying alkaline pH detection and identify a lysine residue as a molecular switch for alkaline pH-mediated channel gating. Moreover, our work establishes hydroxide ions as a distinct class of ion channel ligands and reveals a molecular innovation of chemosensory receptors by which animals broaden their range of chemical senses to detect and avoid strongly alkaline environments.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Structural analysis reveals that YbjP, a previously uncharacterized lipoprotein, binds TolC in a 3:3 stoichiometry, bridging its protomers at the equatorial domain.

M.", "abstract": "This work develops a biophysical theory in which a bioelectric field V(x,t) and a cortical stress field sigma(x,t) are weakly and reciprocally coupled. Because the mechanical sector includes an inertial-viscoelastic element, the coupled system supports two underdamped normal modes whose interference defines a measurable slow cadence f_slow = (omega_{+,r} - omega_{-,r}) / (2 pi). Sampling the dynamics at the neutral moment (the recurring near-symmetric crossing between the two sectors) produces an even circle map (mod pi) for the slow phase, with effective forcing Omega and coupling K2. Both Omega and K2 can be computed a priori from directly measurable electrical and mechanical properties of the tissue (membrane time constant tau_m, cortical stiffness kappa, viscosity eta, effective areal inertia rho_eff, diffusion constants D_V and D_sigma, and weak electromechanical gains gamma, beta_R, beta_I), without arbitrary integer fitting. Helical quantization then appears as a mode-locking problem: the canonical B-DNA rotation number n ~ 10.5 corresponds to the high-order lock rho_pi = 2/21, whose center in this even (mod pi) convention is Omega_{2/21} = pi * (2/21) ~ 0.2992 rad. We define a functional order parameter Lambda as the cross-spectral coherence C_{Vsigma}(f_slow) between V and sigma at f_slow. We hypothesize that high Lambda inside the 2/21 tongue is associated with more stable spindle orientation and cortical anchoring during division, constraining chromatin torsion and supporting controlled proliferation and differentiation. Drifting out of that tongue suggests two generic failure modes: (i) persistent unlocking with low Lambda and elevated spindle-angle dispersion (dysregulated proliferation and abnormal division geometry), and (ii) over-locked, low-plasticity states with a rigid slow cadence (aging-like overlock/drift). The model yields three preregisterable and falsifiable predictions. (P1) Homeostatic epithelia exhibit a shared narrow slow-band cadence in both V and sigma, together with a coherence peak Lambda = C_{Vsigma}(f_slow). (P2) The point (Omega, K2), obtained from those directly measurable properties together with neutral-moment stroboscopy, lies inside the 2/21 Arnold tongue while avoiding broad low-order tongues. (P3) A weak, frequency-specific electrical or mechanical drive at f_slow is predicted to increase Lambda and reduce spindle-angle dispersion, whereas a matched off-resonant control should not.

We propose that stiff nuclei impede cell motion and spheroid coalescence and find that by softening nuclei, fluidization of an otherwise solid-like system occurs. Changes in fluidity during coalescence is fully captured by static cellular properties, such as internuclear spacing and nuclear shape, that can be assessed in individual non-interacting spheroids.

Current imaging studies to visualize the central control of swallowing cannot examine both the biomechanics of the swallow and the brain activity associated with swallow events. An updated version of SimulScan is introduced that provides high-quality and high-speed dynamic imaging, together with fMRI acquisitions, to enable data-driven analysis of swallowing function through a partial least squares correlation (PLSC) analysis. Methods: Integrating updated dynamic imaging approaches, SimulScan can achieve dynamic MRI at 23.75 frames per second and BOLD fMRI at a 1.6 s TR. Five subjects were recruited and scanned with SimulScan twice and with videofluoroscopy to compare the preliminary reliability of measuring swallowing biomechanics and the test-retest relationship in correlated functional and dynamic components of PLSC. Results: High reliability of biomechanical measures of swallowing were achieved across the two SimulScan runs. In addition, these showed moderate correlation with videofluorscopy measures. Correlations between dynamic and functional imaging across runs also showed high reliability indicating that SimulScan with PLSC can extract maps of linked correlations between the brain and the oropharyngeal region.

Groups received one of five types of feedback during training of their unseen dominant hand: UDL (no feedback), RL (binary success/failure feedback with a static threshold), RLA (binary feedback with an adaptive threshold), RLB (binary feedback with adaptive threshold and brief flash of cursor feedback), or EBL (continuous real-time cursor feedback).

EBL and RLB participants experienced a significant reduction in movement variability, with EBL showing a greater decrease compared to UDL.

Our previous work demonstrated that NOG-hIL-4-Tg mice, which express human interleukin-4 (IL-4), support human T and B cell maintenance and enable antigen-specific IgG production following transplantation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In this study, we investigated how IL-4 enhances antibody responses in this model. Flow cytometry and histological analysis revealed that human B cell maintenance was associated with specific plasma hIL-4 concentration ranges at supraphysiological levels. T and B cell receptor repertoire analysis using next-generation sequencing showed that clonal diversity remained largely conserved for one month and decreased to three months post-engraftment. Immunoglobulin repertoire profiling confirmed IgG class switching in an IL-4-concentration-dependent manner. Among the IgG subclasses, IgG3 increased during the first and second months and then decreased thereafter. In contrast, IgG1 tended to increase over time; however, the proportion of IgG subclass varied among individual donors. Following immunization with two distinct peptide antigens, the mice produced enhanced levels of antigen-reactive IgG. However, many B cell clones also exhibited weak responses to unrelated third-party antigens, likely reflecting insufficient affinity maturation. Histological evaluation showed tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS)-like accumulations of B and T cells in the spleen, although fully developed germinal centers were absent. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that NOG-hIL-4-Tg mice maintain human B cells within a regulated IL-4 environment, promote early formation of splenic tertiary lymphoid structures, and support IgG production characterized by clonal expansion, class switching, and somatic hypermutation. These results confirm that human IL-4 expression supports human antibody responses in the PBL-NOG-hIL-4-Tg mouse system.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the impact of myeloid-specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) invalidation on macrophage dynamics and muscle stem cell function following acute injury. We demonstrate that the loss of GR in myeloid cells leads to increased macrophage accumulation, driven by altered proliferation and recruitment, without affecting fibro-adipogenic progenitor differentiation or satellite cell proliferation and differentiation under steady-state conditions. Transcriptomic and CUT&RUN analyses at early regeneration stages reveal that GR directly regulates gene networks involved in efferocytosis and cell cycle control in myeloid cells. Importantly, administration of dexamethasone during the pro-inflammatory phase markedly delays muscle regeneration by impairing monocyte-to-macrophage transition and promoting macrophage proliferation in a myeloid-GR dependent manner, ultimately reducing satellite cell proliferation and myogenesis.

Host-directed therapeutics are emerging as a promising approach for many infectious diseases, but knowledge of critical host factors for malaria is limited. P. falciparum is an obligate intracellular parasite of human erythrocytes, suggesting it has evolved to exploit specific host pathways to establish infection. Here, we report that the AMPK-related kinase NUAK1 is a critical host factor for P. falciparum in erythrocytes and has potential as a therapeutic target. We show that NUAK1 is present in human erythrocytes and undergoes increased phosphorylation in P. falciparum-infected cells. Two highly selective NUAK1 inhibitors, HTH-01-015 and WZ4003, inhibited P. falciparum growth throughout its asexual life cycle, including during erythrocyte invasion. Chemoproteomic profiling confirmed the inhibitors' selectivity for human NUAK1. We further show that treatment with the inhibitors reduces phosphorylation of the well-characterized NUAK1 substrate MYPT1 in erythroid cells. Moreover, we find that genetic overexpression of NUAK1 in erythroid cells partially rescues both the signaling and invasion phenotypes elicited by the small molecule inhibitors. These results establish a critical role for the NUAK1 signaling pathway in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and highlight its potential as a vulnerable target for host-directed malaria control.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Mycobacterial peptidoglycan, displaying characteristic modifications comprising the amidation of D-iso-glutamate (D-iGlu) and the N-glycolylation of muramic acid, is a promising therapeutic target. The genes encoding the enzymes mediating these PG modifications (murT/gatD and namH) were silenced in Mtb using CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to investigate their impact on {beta}-lactam susceptibility and host immune responses. First, qRT-PCR confirmed successful target mRNA knockdown, with variable repression efficiency based on the selected sgRNA, PAM strength, and target site. Phenotypic characterization through spotting dilution and growth curve assays corroborated the essentiality of D-iGlu amidation for mycobacterial survival, in contrast to the N-glycolylation of muramic acid. Moreover, susceptibility assays showed that both PG modifications contribute to {beta}-lactam resistance, with sgRNA2-mediated murT knockdown substantially increasing {beta}-lactam and isoniazid susceptibility. Furthermore, checkerboard assays showed reductions in the minimum fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICImin) value for AMX/MEM+CLA and EMB combinations following the depletion of both PG modifications, with significant differences observed upon namH knockdown. Additionally, D-iGlu amidation was uncovered as a determinant of Mtb survival within THP-1-derived macrophages at 6 days post-infection. Infection of THP-1-derived macrophages with MurT/GatD-depleted Mtb upregulated IL-1{beta} and downregulated IL-10, whereas NamH depletion caused upregulation of both IL-1{beta} and IL-10.

A fundamental gap in knowledge for high consequence viruses such as FMDV is understanding how the virus evolved to evade cellular antiviral responses. FMDV belongs to the Picornaviridae, a family of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. The detection of viral double-stranded viral RNA intermediates during infection can trigger both the assembly of cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) and the activation of the RIG-I-like receptors (RLR)-mediated innate immune response (IIR). FMDV has been shown to antagonize these mechanisms, suggesting that both can limit viral replication. In this study, we investigate the dynamic and importance of SG assembly for IIR activation upon dsRNA stimulation or FMDV replication in porcine epithelial kidney cells. First, we show that the formation of SG following a challenge with poly(I:C), a viral dsRNA mimic, does not modulate the activation of IIR. Our data further reveal transient assembly of SG during FMDV infection followed by virus-induced cleavage of G3BP1, a core SG protein. While SG assembly does not impact viral replication or antiviral response activation, we demonstrate that preventing their disassembly negatively impacts FMDV replication. Overall, our data suggests that while SG assembly is uncoupled from IIR activation, manipulating its disassembly limits replication and might serve as a potential therapeutic target to prevent FMDV infection.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Drug resistance (DR) to INH is the single most common type of DR, mediated by multiple genes/loci including katG, inhA, mabA, mabA-inhA and the oxyR-ahpC intergenic region. Over the course of 6 years, we performed a 2-phase study of 3,696 Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) strains aiming to determine the molecular basis of INH resistance and assess whole genome sequencing (WGS) for predicting resistance. In phase 1, we performed a side-by-side study including 1,767 strains with paired phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) and genotypic DST. We found WGS capable of accurately predicting INH resistance with sensitivity of 90.3%, and specificity of 99.8%. The negative predictive value of WGS for INH susceptibility was 98.8%. Based on these findings, we developed a molecular testing algorithm where phenotypic DST was reduced and applied this new testing algorithm in phase 2 to 1,929 MTBC strains, resulting in streamlined testing, reduced cost and decreasing turnaround time (TAT). The prevalence of INH resistance among MTBC strains in New York was found to be 10.2%. Of the 3,696 isolates tested, 337 were predicted INH resistant by WGS.

Secretion occurs through the T3SS injectisome, a multi-membrane-spanning biomolecular machine. While the overall structure of the injectisome is becoming increasingly well understood, the structural dynamics that regulate secretion remain unresolved. Particularly important for the functional regulation of type 3 secretion are the cytosolic injectisome proteins which transiently associate with injectisomes and whose structural dynamics and function remain incompletely understood. Here, we use long-exposure single-molecule localization microscopy to quantify the bound times of the cytosolic components SctQ, SctL, and SctN, at the injectisome of Yersinia enterocolitica in chemically induced secretion ON and OFF states and in the presence and absence of effector proteins. In the absence of effector proteins, each component exhibits distinct short-lived binding behavior on a timescale of seconds. The presence of the effector protein YopE increases bound times and synchronizes binding behavior across components, even without active secretion. Upon activation of secretion, a subpopulation of long-lived binding events emerges for SctQ, SctL, and SctN even within the same injectisomes, indicating that binding behavior between these proteins is secretion state-dependent and cooperative. These findings establish that the dynamic interactions between cytosolic injectisome proteins are modulated by the presence of secretion substrates and by secretion activating signals. Understanding the protein structural dynamics that underpin these modulations thus likely holds the key to understanding functional regulation of type 3 secretion.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Using immunoblotting, we quantified HSP60 expression in Pocillopora acuta (reef-building coral), Exaiptasia diaphana (sea anemone), and Cassiopea xamachana (upside-down jellyfish). In P. acuta, HSP60 was not detected at the fragment scale under either control or heat stress, whereas isolated cells exhibited transient HSP60 expression during exposure to both control and heated temperatures (+5 degree Celsius above optimum), indicating that HSP60 regulation in this coral is strongly context-dependent and potentially suppressed at the tissue level. In contrast, E. diaphana and C. xamachana showed gradual, temperature-dependent accumulation of HSP60 over 24 h under heated conditions (+5 degree Celsius above its thermal optimum); however, C. xamachana also displayed constitutive basal expression under control conditions. These contrasting profiles highlight clear lineage-specific differences in HSP60 regulation among cnidarians. The consistent antibody cross-reactivity observed across all three species then prompted us to explore the evolutionary basis of this conservation. Phylogenetic analyses of HSP60 sequences confirmed that cnidarian proteins are orthologous to the canonical vertebrate HSP60 (human HSPD1), demonstrating deep structural and evolutionary conservation of this chaperonin across Metazoa. Collectively, these findings reveal that while HSP60 is evolutionarily ancient and conserved, its regulation under thermal stress varies across lineages and physiological contexts, reflecting complex modulation of mitochondrial proteostasis in early-diverging metazoans.

Genomic analysis revealed that Tol 5 possesses a wide range of metabolic pathways for both alkanes and aromatics, including five distinct aromatic degradation routes. Transcriptome analysis identified the specific carbon sources that regulate each degradation pathway. Most pathways were induced by their corresponding carbon sources with high specificity, whereas some were upregulated by multiple related substrates.

The small burst sizes of these phages (13.14 PFU/cell for EmPhiA and 21.4 PFU/cell for EmPhiS) potentially enable continuous coexistence of them with host bacteria within corals, making them putative core members of coral holobionts. Furthermore, host range test showed that EmPhiA and EmPhiS infect both Endozoicomonas bacteria isolated from stony and soft corals, implying their presence in a broad spectrum of host marine invertebrates. Using EmPhiS, we also investigated phage-bacterium interaction during its infection of E. montiporae CL-33. Interestingly, in addition to modulation of host cellular machinery, we found expression of several tellurium resistance proteins by EmPhiS during infection, which may provide the host additional stress resistance. These phages provide a novel model that will greatly advance our understanding of coral-Endozoicomonas-phage interactions.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify a previously uncharacterized kinase that has evolved from pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK). Through biochemical and systems-level analyses, we show that this enzyme, encoded by Rv1127c in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), has diverged from its ancestral role in central carbon metabolism to function as a histidine kinase in pathogenic mycobacteria and related species. We designate this enzyme Virulence Associated DiKinase (VadK), reflecting its ability to autophosphorylate and role in coordinating metabolism and virulence. VadK is essential for the utilization of exogenous carbon sources critical for survival within the host and is required for Mtb pathogenicity in murine models of tuberculosis. Furthermore, VadK interacts with key enzymes of the methylcitrate cycle, and 13C-metabolic flux analysis indicates that it fine-tunes flux through this pathway, with elevated flux proving growth limiting. Together, these findings identify VadK as a previously unrecognized regulatory kinase that integrates metabolic control with virulence in Mtb, revealing a new facet of metabolic regulation in bacterial pathogenesis and a potential target for therapeutic intervention.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

CO2 fixation proceeds via two branches of pathway: progressive reduction to the methyl group in the methyl branch and one-step reduction to CO in the carbonyl branch. In the final step of the pathway, the methyl group, CO, and CoA are combined into a carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (CODH)/acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS) complex to form acetyl-CoA. Here, we show direct CO fixation to the carbonyl group of acetyl-CoA in both archaeal and bacterial WL pathways under hydrogenogenic growth conditions using 13C tracer-based metabolomics. A combination of metabolomics and proteomics suggested that the hydrogenotrophically grown Thermodesulfatator indicus and Archaeoglobus sp. strain MCR cells, directly fixed CO using free-form ACS in the carbonyl branch with relatively low CO availability. In contrast, carboxydotrophically grown Archaeoglobus cells utilize the CODH/ACS complex for CO2 fixation rather than CO fixation. Direct CO fixation by free-form ACS is more advantageous for conserving reduced ferredoxin compared with the thermodynamically challenged CO2 reduction by CODH. These findings provide further insight into the origin and evolution of the most ancient inorganic carbon fixation pathway and geochemical cycles on early Earth.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

However, the knowledge about the evolution of symbiont traits enabling such specificity remains very limited. The bean bug Riptortus pedestris acquires Caballeronia from environmental soil and harbors it in its gut symbiotic organ. This bug-Caballeronia symbiosis is an ideal model to clarify the evolutionary process of symbiotic bacteria because members of their outgroups, such as Paraburkholderia and Pandoraea, can also colonize the host symbiotic organ but are outcompeted when co-inoculated with the native symbiont, Caballeronia. In this study, mechanisms underpinning the competitiveness of Caballeronia inside the insect gut were investigated. First, comparative microscopy revealed that Caballeronia's success in the gut is largely attributed to its ability to migrate rapidly to the M4 region through chemotaxis, wherein a cheA insertion mutant showed significantly delayed infection speed and lower competitiveness against wild-type. In addition, Paraburkholderia and Pandoraea frequently formed biofilm-like aggregates in the midgut, which could delay their colonization. By contrast, Caballeronia formed no biofilm-like aggregates, at least inside the insect gut. This study reveals that Caballeronia symbiont has evolved traits like chemotaxis and reaction against AMP to establish an efficient and exclusive symbiotic relationship with their bean bug host. Although the genetic and molecular bases of the chemotaxis and the cell aggregates remain unclear, it is strongly suggested that the dynamic gain and loss of these traits enables Caballeronia to specifically associate with the insect host, R. pedestris.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

S. aureus encodes a specialized type VIIb secretion system (T7SSb) that contributes to virulence and persistence in the host. T7SSb supports secretion of small proteins belonging to a WXG100 family as well as larger LXG polymorphic toxins. Secretion of these proteins is facilitated by the T7SSb complex that assembles in the cell envelope from core components EsaA, EssA, EssB, and the conserved ATPase EssC. T7SSb-mediated secretion also requires the cell wall hydrolase EssH that bears a cystine histidine-dependent amidase/peptidase (CHAP) domain. Hereby, we show that the N-terminal domain of EssH functions together with the CHAP domain to support T7SSb secretion. We find that EssH copurifies with the T7SSb core components and is required for the assembly of EsaA across the cell wall. Finally, secreted EssH is released into the extracellular milieu and degraded by the secreted staphylococcal protease, staphopain A. We propose a model to capture the function of the dedicated cell wall hydrolase EssH for T7SSb in S. aureus.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Disparate and siloed surveillance methods present a major challenge for tracing and disrupting AMR transmission, with clinical monitoring focusing on detecting specific pathogens or specific genes of interest, and environmental surveys often relying on inferences drawn from indicator organisms. Here, we demonstrate that, following sample-specific pre-processing, common surveillance approaches can be applied consistently to profile AMR abundance, distribution, and phenotypes across diverse reservoirs, including soil, sediment, water, wastewater, and faecal samples from both urban and agricultural settings. Across all sample types, three core methods provided complementary insights: (i) quantitative PCR (qPCR) arrays to measure multiple AMR genes, (ii) gene- and genome-centric metagenomics for comprehensive resistome profiling, and (iii) culture-based genomics with susceptibility testing to link genotypes to phenotypes. We applied this approach to profile 1,032 metagenome-assembled genomes, 66 bacterial isolate genomes, and 78 and 6,442 AMR genes/reference sequences via qPCR and metagenomics, respectively. This integrated framework revealed a moderate prevalence but high diversity of resistance mechanisms in both pathogens and non-pathogenic bacteria with potentially transmissible genes, with wastewater especially enriched in AMR genes. We detected mismatches between genotype and phenotype predictions and a prevalence of intermediate resistance phenotypes, highlighting how many mechanisms of environmental resistance remain poorly understood. Overall, this study demonstrates that unified field-leading surveillance methods can be extended beyond clinical contexts into diverse environmental and animal samples, while highlighting that multiple methods are needed to capture the diverse AMR genotypes and phenotypes in these settings to enable comprehensive monitoring and adaptive solutions to restrict transmission.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Our quantitative tracking results on A. castellanii confirm the core patterns in the original studies reported by Schuster and Levandowsky; attraction to fMLP and GlcNAc and lack of response to MurNAc or the peptide antagonist BOC-FLFLF, while revealing previously missed attraction to mannan. In contrast, A. polyphaga demonstrated a more restricted response, with significant chemotaxis observed only toward fMLP, and lack of motility in the presence of MurNAc or BOC-FLFLF. Notably, formyl peptide responses were differentially modulated: BOC-FLFLF reduced fMLP-induced directionality in A. castellanii without impairing motility, while in A. polyphaga, it suppressed both velocity and orientation. These distinct chemoattractant signatures are consistent with micro-niche adaptation, and we hypothesise that fine-scale tuning of receptor thresholds to local prey spectra contributes to the observed species differences rather than large-scale habitat segregation.

V.; Kiontke, S.; Burchert, F.; Zegarra, V.; Kern, A.; Fritsch, V. N.; Baranov, D.; Bronowska, A.; Bange, G.; Antelmann, H.", "abstract": "SUMMARY: The MarR-family regulator MhqR of Staphylococcus aureus (SaMhqR) was previously characterized as quinone-sensing repressor of the mhqRED operon. Here, we resolved the crystal structures of apo-SaMhqR and the 2-methylbenzoquinone (MBQ)-bound SaMhqR complex. AlphaFold3 modelling was used to predict the structure of the SaMhqR in complex with its operator DNA. In the DNA-bound SaMhqR state, S65 and S66 of an allosteric 3-4 loop adapted a helically wound conformation to elongate helix 4 for optimal DNA binding. Key residues for MBQ interaction were identified as F11, F39, E43, and H111, forming the MBQ-binding pocket. MBQ binding prevented the formation of the extended helix 4 in the allosteric loop, leading to steric clashes with the DNA. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed an increased intrinsic dynamics within the allosteric loop and the {beta}1/{beta}2-wing regions after MBQ binding, to prevent DNA binding. Using mutational analyses, we validated that F11, F39, and H111 are required for quinone sensing in vivo, whereas S65 and S66 of the allosteric loop and D88, K89, V91 and Y92 of the {beta}1/{beta}2-wing are essential for DNA binding in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our structure-guided modelling and mutational analyses identified a quinone-binding pocket of SaMhqR and the mechanism of SaMhqR inactivation, which involves local structural rearrangements of an allosteric loop and a high intrinsic dynamics to prevent DNA interactions. Our results provide novel insights into the redox-mechanism of the conserved SaMhqR repressor, that functions as an important determinant of quinone and antimicrobial resistance in S. aureus. IMPORTANCE: S. aureus is a major human pathogen, which can cause life-threatening infections in humans. However, treatment options are limited due to the prevalence of antimicrobial resistant isolates in the hospital and the community. The MarR-type repressor SaMhqR was described to control resistance towards quinones and quinone-like antimicrobials. However, the redox-regulatory mechanism of SaMhqR by quinones was unknown. In this work, we explored the DNA-binding and quinone-sensing mechanism of SaMhqR and identified a quinone-binding pocket and an allosteric loop, which facilitates DNA binding activity via a helical wound conformation and adapts an unstructured coiled conformation upon quinone binding to inhibit DNA binding. A similar mechanism has been recently discovered for regulation of uric acid resistance by UrtR family repressors (1). Our results contribute to a better understanding of antimicrobial resistance regulation, which can be exploited for future drug-design to eradicate multidrug-resistant S. aureus.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

Precise allelic replacements and isogenic strain comparisons demonstrated that these mutations not only protect against phage predation but also create a genetic context that facilitates the emergence of {beta}-lactam resistance, including resistance to carbapenems.

While macrophage-mediated immune modulation is pivotal in S. aureus pathogenesis, bacterial manipulation of macrophage pathways remains poorly understood. The specialised type VII secretion system (T7SSb) is an important virulence-associated factor and immune modulator during staphylococcal infection, although, unlike its mycobacterial counterparts, its role in controlling staphylococcal-macrophage interactions remains unclear. Employing high-resolution time-lapse imaging, we demonstrated an induction of cell death corpses or pore-induced cellular traps (PITs) during S. aureus infection of macrophages in vitro, with a higher number of PITs forming in macrophages infected with S. aureus lacking EssC ({Delta}essC), a central T7SS transporter. Interestingly, {Delta}essC-infected macrophages displayed increased bacterial escape compared to wild type (WT)-infected cells, implicating a role for T7SS in delaying macrophage cell death. {Delta}essC-infected macrophages were also efferocytosed less compared to WT in vitro. We investigated the induction of cell death signalling markers in WT and {Delta}essC-infected macrophages and demonstrated that the T7SS delayed the induction of key cell death pathways, necroptosis and pyroptosis. A dual RNAseq analysis of WT- and {Delta}essC-infected macrophages further indicated a T7SS-dependent increase in ferroptosis later in infection, along with modulation of chemokines. We demonstrated that individual T7SS effectors, EsxA and EsxC, which were induced within macrophages, could individually delay macrophage cell death. Furthermore, in a murine skin infection model, we showed that effector and transporter mutants have distinct S. aureus infection outcomes.

Our previous work has shown that increased expression of the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (Nprc) may drive cardiac remodeling in response to high fat diet. In this study, we hypothesized that Nprc plays a central role in preventing and reversing experimental HFpEF. Methods: Nprc knockout mice were generated to induce global, cardiomyocyte-specific, or adipocyte-specific disruption of the Nprc (Npr3) gene. HFpEF was induced by the 2-hit stress of L-NAME and high fat diet. Outcomes measured included echocardiography, exercise endurance, invasive catheterization, and histologic assessment. Differential gene expression in adipocyte Nprc knockout visceral adipose tissue was investigated via bulk RNA sequencing and validated by RT-qPCR and culture of H9C2 cells with or without Wnt5a treatment. Adipocyte-mediated Wnt ligand release was interrupted in vivo via LGK974 injection in mice subjected to HFpEF conditions. Results: Global inducible Nprc knockout prevented and reversed structural, hemodynamic, echocardiographic, and exercise tolerance features of HFpEF. This effect was found to be driven by adipocyte-specific, not cardiomyocyte-specific Nprc expression. Bulk RNA sequencing of adipocyte-specific Nprc knockout in peri-gonadal visceral adipose tissue identified downregulation of several secretory pathways, including Wnt pathways. Wnt5a was identified as one of the most downregulated genes by RNA sequencing and specifically validated by qPCR. Wnt5a exposure increased cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro, and LGK974 (PORCN inhibitor) treatment in vivo decreased circulating Wnt5a levels and improved cardiac remodeling in HFpEF.

In the fruit fly Drosophilamelanogaster, it is possible to completely suppress endogenous DSBs while retaining normal fertility. We took advantage of this system to generate fly strains with and without a mutant allele of mei-P22, a gene that is essential for meiotic DSB formation, on a common genetic background. This allowed us to investigate the relationship between DSBs and genome-wide mutation patterns, using a mutation accumulation design to allow un-selected spontaneous mutations to be observed. Following 30 generations of mutation accumulation, we identified over 1800 mutations by whole-genome sequencing. The presence of meiotic DSBs had little effect on the rate and spectrum of point mutations. We found that mutations were more likely to occur in areas of the genome with higher rates of crossover recombination, regardless of whether meiotic DSBs were occurring.

Opti-mal characterization of antibodies requires characterizing light and heavy chains as pairs in addition to sequencing their vari-able domains and identifying any modifications. This is best addressed using protein centric proteomics as heterogeneity information such as the specific clonal origin of each identified fragment can be retained.

Using electron-based fragmentation methods, we employed the prototype timsOmni mass spectrometer to obtain full CDR3 sequences for paired heavy and light chains with high confidence. Optimal results were obtained by performing Electron Induced Dissociation (EID) at ~35 eV electron energy, on native-like fragment antigen-binding (Fab) precursor ions.

However, 2n = 9 and 2n = 10 karyotypes with duplicated large chromosomes were also observed in animals from both laboratory cultures and field samples, prompting us to further investigate this phenomenon. To this end, we optimized a flow cytometric approach that enables easy and rapid studies of tens or even hundreds of animals simultaneously to gain insight into the karyotype polymorphisms present in a culture, and consistently tracked karyotype dynamics in multiple cultures over a period of 26 months. We demonstrate that de novo duplications of the large chromosome in M. lignano can spontaneously appear under laboratory conditions and can become dominant in laboratory cultures. Since uncontrolled chromosomal duplications can complicate genetic studies in laboratory model organisms, we propose an approach to easily control the karyotype of experimental cultures by regular karyotyping M. lignano subcultures using flow cytometry and replacing cultures with de novo chromosome duplications as needed.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}

A.; Campagna, L.", "abstract": "Melanin-based plumage coloration in birds is shaped by pigment composition as well as melanosome morphology and distribution, however, the ways in which these factors together modulate observable color remain poorly understood. We investigate this relationship in the Capuchino Seedeaters (genus Sporophila), whose recent, rapid radiation driven by sexual selection resulted in 12 species with diverse coloration patterns. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and micro-computed tomography (CT), combined with a novel application of Fontana-Masson stain to image melanosomes at high resolution, we characterize melanosome distribution and morphology in several variably colored plumage patches across Capuchino species. Melanosome morphologies followed patch-specific patterns that did not directly correlate with coloration: crown feather melanosomes were larger, more elongated, and had greater percent eumelanin content than those in belly, throat, or dorsum/rump patches. We also observed that dorsal patches had more total melanin than ventral ones, with pigment and coloration patterns suggesting possible signaling and photoprotective roles. More generally, we show how the patch-specific coloration of male Capuchinos is accompanied by differences in melanosome morphology and melanin composition and abundance. Our work highlights the challenges that remain in understanding how the nanoscale mechanisms of melanin-based pigmentation translate into macroscale plumage coloration.", "date": "2025-10-30", "journal": ""}
