Many empirical and simulation studies have shown that assuming SRH conditions can lead to significant errors in phylogenetic inference when the data violates these assumptions. Yet, many simulation studies focused on extreme non-SRH conditions that represent worst-case scenarios and not the average empirical dataset. In this study, we simulate datasets under various degrees of non-SRH conditions using empirically derived parameters to mimic real data and examine the effects of incorrectly assuming SRH conditions on inferring phylogenies. Our results show that maximum likelihood inference is generally quite robust to a wide range of SRH model violations but is inaccurate under extreme convergent evolution.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

To search for novel regulators of hematopoiesis, we performed genome-wide in vivo hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based CRISPR knockout screens for regulators of hematopoiesis. We discovered SAGA complex members, including Tada2b and Taf5l, as key regulators of hematopoiesis. Loss of Tada2b or Taf5l strongly inhibited hematopoiesis in vivo, led to a buildup of immature hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow, and was associated with upregulation of interferon pathway genes. Loss of these factors also enhanced the cell outgrowth and the interferon pathway in an in vivo human myelodysplastic syndrome model, suggesting that loss of SAGA complex activity could contribute to hematological disease progression.

We systematically analyzed ~17,000 transcriptomes from 35 human tissues to quantitatively evaluate the individual and combined contributions of sex and age to transcriptomic variations. We discovered extensive sex-dimorphisms during aging with distinct patterns of change in gene expression and alternative splicing (AS). Intriguingly, the male-biased age-associated AS events have a stronger association with Alzheimer's disease, and the female-biased events are often regulated by several sex-biased splicing factors that may be controlled by estrogen receptors. Breakpoint analysis showed that sex-dimorphic aging rates are significantly associated with decline of sex hormones, with males having a larger and earlier transcriptome change.

To evaluate existing models of neurocognitive ageing such as compensation, maintenance, or reserve, we explore how various known brain-based and cardiorespiratory fitness factors intersect to better understand cognitive decline. In a preregistered study (https://osf.io/6fqg7), we tested 73 neurologically healthy older adults aged 60 to 81 (M = 65.51, SD = 4.94, 49% female) and collected neuroimaging (functional, structural, and perfusion MRI), cardiorespiratory fitness, and behavioural performance data to investigate a well-documented, prominent cognitive challenge for older adults: word-finding failures. Blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal was recorded while participants responded to a definition-based tip-of-the-tongue task, high-resolution T1-weighted imaging was employed to estimate grey matter volume, and perfusion (or cerebral blood flow) was indexed using a multi-delay pseudocontinuous arterial spin labelling approach. Commonality analyses were used to analyse the multi-domain data (neuroimaging, cardiorespiratory fitness, language skills, demographic characteristics). We aimed to uncover associations between predictors, which have previously been theoretically-implicated, in explaining age-related tip-of-the-tongue rates. Commonality analyses revealed that functional activation of language networks associated with tip-of-the-tongue states is in part linked with age and, interestingly, cardiorespiratory fitness levels. Age-associated atrophy and perfusion in regions other than those showing functional differences accounted for variance in tip-of-the-tongue states. Our findings can be interpreted in the context of the classic models of neurocognitive ageing suggesting compensation. Brain health indices in concordance with cardiorespiratory fitness measures have the potential to provide a more holistic explanation of individual differences in age-related cognitive decline.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

G.; Fletcher, D.", "abstract": "Spatially explicit capture--recapture models are used widely to estimate the density of animal populations. The population is represented by an inhomogeneous Poisson point process, where each point is the activity centre of an individual and density corresponds to the intensity surface. Estimates of density that assume a homogeneous model (`average density') are robust to unmodelled inhomogeneity, and the coverage of confidence intervals is good when the intensity surface does not change, even if it is quite uneven. However, coverage is poor when the intensity surface differs among realisations. Practical examples include populations with dynamic social aggregation, and the population in a region sampled using small detector arrays. Poor coverage results from overdispersion of the number of detected individuals; the number is Poisson when the intensity surface is static, but stochasticity leads to extra-Poisson variation. We investigated overdispersion from three point processes with a stochastic intensity surface (Thomas cluster process, random habitat mosaic and log-Gaussian Cox process). A previously proposed correction for overdispersion performed poorly. The problem is lessened by assuming population size to be fixed, but this assumption cannot be justified for common study designs. Rigorous correction for spatial overdispersion requires either prior knowledge of the generating process or replicated and representative sampling. When the generating process is known, variation in a new scalar measure of local density predicts overdispersion. Otherwise, overdispersion may be estimated empirically from the numbers detected on independent detector arrays.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

An important ongoing debate is how cell geometry, wall mechanical stresses, and other internal and external cues are integrated to determine the orientation of the cortical array. Here, we demonstrate that microtubule-based nucleation can markedly shift the balance between these often competing directional cues. For this, we developed a novel, more realistic model for microtubule-based nucleation in the simulation platform CorticalSim, which avoids the longstanding inhomogeneity problem stemming from previous, less realistic models for microtubule-based nucleation. We show that microtubule-based nucleation increases the sensitivity of the array to cell geometry, and extends the regime of spontaneous alignment compared to isotropic nucleation. In the case of cylindrical cell shapes, we show that this translates into a strong tendency to align in the transverse direction rather than along the vertical axis, and this is robust against small directional cues favouring the longitudinal direction. Comparing various cylinders and boxes, we show that different nucleation mechanisms result in different preferred array orientations, with the largest differences on cylinders. Our model provides a powerful tool for investigating how plant cells integrate multiple biases to orient their cortical arrays, offering new insights into the biophysical mechanisms underlying cell shape and growth.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Information about task duration might influence the adaptation of gait features, given that task duration influences the time available to explore and adapt the aspects of gait that reduce energy cost. We hypothesized that information about task duration influences adaptation to split-belt walking based on two competing mechanisms: individuals anticipating a prolonged adaptation period may either (1) extend exploration of energetically suboptimal gait patterns, or (2) adapt toward a more energy-efficient pattern earlier to maintain an energetic reserve to sustain the task longer. We tested three groups: N=19 participants received minute-by-minute updates during a 10-minute adaptation duration (True group), N=19 participants received no updates during a 10-minute adaptation duration and were misled to expect a prolonged 30-minute adaptation duration (False group), and N=14 participants received one update halfway through a 10-minute adaptation duration (Control group). We measured step length asymmetry, leg work, and metabolic cost. Our results partially supported our hypothesis but did not confirm the underlying mechanisms. While step length asymmetry did not differ significantly between groups during adaptation, the True group generated a more effortful gait pattern with a greater increase in metabolic cost (p=0.002) and higher work with the leg on the slow belt (p=0.012). Additionally, the True group showed no association between step length asymmetry and metabolic cost (p=0.203), contrary to the Control (r=-0.55, p=0.043) and False groups (r=-0.51, p=0.027). Finally, we observed that the False group showed greater retention of the split-belt aftereffects than the Control and False groups (p<0.001).

Reperfusion of the infarcted myocardium restores blood flow and reduces primary ischemic injury.

While negative outcomes such as reactive oxygen species generation are strongly associated with I/R injury, cardiac energy metabolism is also greatly disrupted. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that the restoration of normal fuel oxidation in the myocardium regulates the extent of contractile recovery. A better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying I/R injury may allow us to develop new treatments that limit the negative aspects of the process. In this study, we examined the role played by GCN5L1, a protein implicated in the regulation of energy metabolism, in I/R injury. We demonstrate that cardiac- specific loss of GCN5L1 promotes the inhibitory phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase in vitro and in vivo, a process likely to inhibit glucose oxidation, and that this corresponds to increased myocardial damage following ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a male-biased cancer that is highly aggressive and resistant to treatment, with poor patient survival. Dismal prognoses in GBM are due in part to the specialized immune system of the brain, consisting largely of microglia, which regulate GBM development and progression. We hypothesized that microglia function differently in females and males and thereby contribute to the observed male bias in GBM. We sorted TAM-MGs (tumor-associated macrophages - microglia) from human GBMs and low-grade gliomas and performed bulk transcriptomic and epigenomic assays to identify sex-biased gene expression. We used published single-cell transcriptomic data from human GBMs to predict sex-biased TAM-MG interactions with other cell types. We found that female and male TAM-MGs mount different inflammatory responses, with female TAM-MGs displaying stronger interferon signaling and cytotoxic T-cell interactions that should enhance anti-tumor immunity in GBM. We validated these sex-differential inflammatory responses experimentally and determined that genes on the sex chromosomes, specifically those expressed by Xi (the inactive X chromosome), drive these differences. Together, our results suggest that sex-differential TAM-MG inflammatory responses contribute to the higher incidence and mortality of GBM in males.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Intriguingly, the loss of SETX not only triggers non-canonical hyper-end resection requiring RAD52 and XPF, but also stalls Pol-primase-initiated end-fill DNA synthesis due to the accumulation of RNA/DNA hybrids on single-strand DNA (ssDNA) overhangs at deDSBs.

Prior studies demonstrate that acute CDK12 loss confers a homologous recombination (HR) deficiency (HRd) phenotype via premature intronic polyadenylation (IPA) of key HR pathway genes, including ATM. However, mCRPC patients have not demonstrated benefit from therapies that exploit HRd such as inhibitors of polyADP ribose polymerase (PARP). Based on this discordance, we sought to test the hypothesis that an HRd phenotype is primarily a consequence of acute CDK12 loss and the effect is greatly diminished in prostate cancers adapted to CDK12 loss. Analyses of whole genome sequences (WGS) and RNA sequences (RNAseq) of human mCRPCs determined that tumors with biallelic CDK12 alterations (CDK12BAL) lack genomic scar signatures indicative of HRd, despite carrying bi-allelic loss and the appearance of the hallmark tandem-duplicator phenotype (TDP). Experiments confirmed that acute CDK12 inhibition resulted in aberrant polyadenylation and downregulation of long genes (including BRCA1 and BRCA2) but such effects were modest or absent in tumors adapted to chronic CDK12BAL. One key exception was ATM, which did retain transcript shortening and reduced protein expression in the adapted CDK12BAL models. However, CDK12BAL cells demonstrated intact HR as measured by RAD51 foci formation following irradiation. CDK12BAL cells showed a vulnerability to targeting of CDK13 by sgRNA or CDK12/13 inhibitors and in vivo treatment of prostate cancer xenograft lines showed that tumors with CDK12BAL responded to the CDK12/13 inhibitor SR4835, while CDK12-intact lines did not. Collectively, these studies show that aberrant polyadenylation and long HR gene downregulation is primarily a consequence of acute CDK12 deficiency, which is largely compensated for in cells that have adapted to CDK12 loss. These results provide an explanation for why PARPi monotherapy has thus far failed to consistently benefit patients with CDK12 alterations, though alternate therapies that target CDK13 or transcription are candidates for future research and testing.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

The player either followed instructions or made spontaneous decisions to lie or tell the truth, while the observer judged whether to trust the player based solely on their facial expressions. We examined observers' behavioral data, event-related potentials, and interhemispheric EEG asymmetries in both signal magnitude and instantaneous phase. The results revealed a significant effect of trustworthiness on hemispheric asymmetry in the observer's centroparietal phase activities between 1500-3000 ms post-stimulus. Subsequent frequency-based analysis revealed that this asymmetry in phase progression was primarily driven by lateralized signal frequency. These findings suggest that the perception of facial trustworthiness involves dynamic hemispheric lateralization.

Using novel synthetically generated photorealistic stimuli, we show that deep convolutional neural networks optimized for object recognition encode information on approximate numerosity across diverse objects and scene types, which could be linearly read out from distributed activity patterns of later convolutional layers of different network architectures tested. In contrast, untrained networks with random weights failed to represent numerosity with abstractness to other visual properties, and instead captured mainly low-level visual features. Our findings emphasize the importance of using complex, naturalistic stimuli to investigate mechanisms of number sense in both biological and artificial systems, and suggest that the capacity of untrained networks to account for early life numerical abilities should be reassessed. They further point to a possible, so far underappreciated, contribution of the brain's ventral visual pathway to representing numerosity with abstractness to other high-level visual properties.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

In the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), marine and coastal ecotypes have been identified in the North-East Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, yet the genomic basis of their divergence remains unclear. Here, we present the first genome-scale analysis of this species complex, integrating whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and RAD-seq data from populations across its distribution range. In addition to the marine and coastal ecotypes, we identify a previously undetected lineage which is present in southern Morocco, the Canary Islands and even in South Africa. This southern Atlantic lineage exhibits a gradient of admixture with northern populations near the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition zone. Genomic differentiation landscapes reveal large regions of high linkage disequilibrium, likely corresponding to thirteen structural variants (SVs) segregating within or between the lineages. Notably, three of the six SVs contributing to the gene flow barrier between northern ecotypes originated in the southern lineage, supporting a partially shared evolutionary history between the coastal ecotype and the southern lineage. Our findings suggest that anchovy ecotype divergence has been shaped by a combination of ancient structural variation, admixture, and local adaptation. This study highlights how SVs that arose between geographically isolated lineages can act as key genetic elements in ecotype formation, reinforcing reproductive isolation through distinct evolutionary pathways.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Experiments demonstrated that synaptic plasticity not only depends on excitatory activity but also on the rate and timing of inhibitory events. Hypothesising that the regulatory effect of inhibition is mediated by membrane potential hyperpolarisation, we identify fast fluctuation sensitivity as a contributing factor to the inhibitory regulation of plasticity. Fast fluctuation sensitivity characterises the influence of fast changes in the membrane potential on the plasticity model predictions, including (short) hyperpolarising events. Furthermore, by introducing a novel plasticity model, the Voltage-Dependent Pathway model, we show that fast fluctuation sensitivity enables a precise temporal regulation of plasticity via inhibition tightly locked to stimulus presentation. In recurrent networks, receptive fields develop independent of the degree of fluctuation sensitivity, yet the temporal precision of inhibitory regulation is critical for the heterogeneity and quality of the resulting representation.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

However, recent research has revealed additional regulatory roles. In this study, we investigate piRNA-305221, which is highly expressed in the ovaries of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica, to understand its involvement in oogenesis and reproduction. piRNA-305221 is found in germinal and somatic cells during the gonadotropic cycle, and is maternally provided to the egg. Its expression correlates with critical ovarian events, such as endoreplication and follicular cell differentiation, suggesting regulatory functions beyond TE silencing. Functional knockdown using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) resulted in delayed oviposition, malformed oothecae, and reduced offspring viability. Gene expression analysis revealed that the reduction of piRNA-305221 decreased shade mRNA levels, impairing the conversion of ecdysone to its active form, 20-hydroxyecdysone, and a concomitant increase in expression of upstream steroidogenic genes (spook, phantom, disembodied). These results indicate that piRNA-305221 may regulate steroidogenesis through direct or indirect control of mRNA targets.

In male Drosophila, aggression is often characterized by lunging, a frequent and comparatively gentle combat behavior. Here, we provide a behavioral paradigm for studying a less frequent but more vigorous fighting form known as tussling. While social enrichment decreases lunging, aligning with past observations, it heightens the more forceful tussling behavior. These two forms of aggression rely on different olfactory receptor neurons, specifically Or67d for lunging and Or47b for tussling. We further identify three pairs of central pC1 neurons that specifically promote tussling. Moreover, shifting from lunging to tussling in socially enriched males is accompanied with better territory control and mating success.

C.", "abstract": "Vision is an active process. We move our eyes and head to acquire useful information and to track objects of interest. While these movements are essential for many behaviors, they greatly complicate the analysis of retinal image motion---the image motion of an object reflects both how that object moves in the world and how the eye moves relative to the scene. Our brain must account for the visual consequences of self-motion to accurately perceive the 3D layout and motion of objects in the scene. Traditionally, compensation for eye movements (e.g., smooth pursuit) has been modeled as a simple vector subtraction process. While these models are effective for pure eye rotations and 2D scenes, we show that they fail to apply to more natural viewing geometries involving combinations of eye rotation and translation. We develop theoretical predictions for how perception of object motion and depth should depend on the observer's inferred viewing geometry. Through psychophysical experiments, we demonstrate novel perceptual biases that manifest when different viewing geometries are simulated by optic flow, in the absence of physical eye movements. Remarkably, these biases occur automatically, without training or feedback, and are well predicted by our theoretical framework. A neural network model trained to perform the same tasks exhibits neural response patterns similar to those observed in macaque area MT, suggesting a possible neural basis for these adaptive computations. Our findings demonstrate that the visual system automatically infers viewing geometry from optic flow and flexibly attributes components of image motion to either self-motion or depth structure according to the inferred geometry. Our findings unify previously separate bodies of work by showing that the visual consequences of self-motion play a crucial role in computing object motion and depth, thus enabling the visual system to adaptively perceive a dynamic 3D environment.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we employed molecular, optical, electrophysiological and tonometric strategies to establish the role of TGF{beta}2 in transcription and functional expression of mechanosensitive channel isoforms alongside studies of TM contractility in biomimetic hydrogels, and intraocular pressure (IOP) regulation in a mouse model of TGF{beta}2 -induced OHT. TGF{beta}2 upregulated expression of TRPV4 and PIEZO1 transcripts and time-dependently augmented functional TRPV4 activation.

Trpv4-deficient mice resisted TGF{beta}2-driven increases in IOP, but nocturnal OHT was not additive to TGF{beta}-evoked OHT. Our study establishes the fundamental role of TGF{beta} as a modulator of mechanosensing in nonexcitable cells, identifies the TRPV4 channel as the final common mechanism for TM contractility and circadian and pathological OHT, and offers insights for future treatments that can lower IOP in the sizeable cohort of hypertensive glaucoma patients that resist current treatments.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

We provide a comparison of the specificity and kinetics of the PET signals acquired when using nanobodies radiolabeled with 89Zr, 64Cu and 18F, and find that the chelation of the 89Zr and 64Cu radioisotopes to anti-TfR nanobodies results in radioisotope release upon endocytosis of the radiolabeled nanobodies. We used a knock-in mouse that expresses a TfR with a human ectodomain (huTfR +/+) as a source of bone marrow for transplants into C57BL/6 recipients and show that VHH188 detects such transplants by PET/CT.

We are motivated by recent work suggesting the importance of a wider context for SHM, however, assigning an independent rate to each k-mer leads to an exponential proliferation of parameters. Thus, using convolutions on 3-mer embeddings, we develop \"thrifty\" models of SHM that have fewer free parameters than a 5-mer model and yet have a significantly wider context. These offer a slight performance improvement over a 5-mer model. We also find that a per-site effect is not necessary to explain SHM patterns given nucleotide context.

UTX-deficient mice exhibit an accumulation of CD8+ progenitors and a reduction in effectors, suggesting that UTX facilitates progenitor differentiation to effectors. This function is independent of UTX's demethylase activity and instead depends on interactions with transcription factors TCF1 and STAT3, which regulate progenitor T cells maintenance and differentiation.

RET activates signaling pathways regulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival in diverse tissues that include the thyroid and enteric nervous system. Mutations that reduce RET levels or disrupt function can cause Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR), characterized by abnormal distal colon innervation in the developing embryo. In contrast, mutations that constitutively activate RET can lead to tumorigenesis, most notably in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) syndromes usually involving the thyroid. Paradoxically, some RET mutations can both reduce RET activity in enteric ganglia, and increase signaling in other tissues, resulting in patients suffering from both HSCR and MEN2A. Although extensive research has been conducted on RET mutations, the structural and mechanistic bases underlying these paradoxical effects remain unclear. Here, we curated data on 70 positions in RET extracellular domains where point-mutations were associated with HSCR, MEN2A, or both. Taking a structure-based approach, we predict the potential effects of mutations in these positions on RET structure. Our analysis suggests that approximately 90% of positions associated with HSCR can, upon mutation, disrupt intramolecular interactions that stabilize RET tertiary structure: residues buried in the protein core, calcium-binding sites, or residues participating in stabilizing intramolecular electrostatic/covalent bonds. A smaller subset of mutations involves substitutions to/from glycines or prolines in key positions. Only a small minority of HSCR-associated positions affect protein-protein interactions needed for signal activation. On the other hand, our analysis showed that ~75% of mutations in positions that cause MEN2A lead to an unpaired cysteine that can form an intermolecular disulfide bond between two RET monomers. Other mutations that cause MEN2A are also predicted to enhance RET homodimerization via extracellular domains that are proximal to the membrane. Importantly, substitutions that concurrently destabilizes RET tertiary structure and lead to an unpaired cysteine are predicted to cause the paradoxical co-occurrence of HSCR and MEN2A. Our findings suggest a mechanistic basis for almost all identified pathological mutations in RET and imply that therapeutic strategies for targeting RET activity in HSCR and MEN2A may need to be orthogonal.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

J.; Bonnefond, M.; Schmitz, C.", "abstract": "Motor anticipation is essential for accurate and coordinated hand movements in humans. A valuable framework to study it is provided by the Bimanual Load-Lifting Task (BLLT), in which voluntarily lifting a load supported by the opposite forearm is preceded by anticipatory inhibition of the elbow flexors in the supporting arm, preventing forearm instability. In sixteen adult participants performing the BLLT, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying anticipatory inhibition. Optimal postural stabilization was observed when the elbow flexor was inhibited around 30 ms before unloading. Stronger muscle inhibition in this optimal time interval was associated with reduced excitability - indexed by high-gamma (90-130 Hz) power - and increased high-beta (18-25 Hz) power in the contralateral Supplementary Motor Area (SMA). Mediation analysis revealed that high-gamma power reduction significantly mediates the relationship between high-beta power and anticipatory inhibition. We further showed that trials containing beta bursts (22-28 Hz) exhibit optimally timed anticipatory inhibition and a concurrent decrease in high-gamma power. Directed connectivity analysis using the Phase Slope Index demonstrated that these beta bursts propagate to the SMA from the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and the elbow-related primary motor cortex (M1), both of which increase their burst probability during SMA bursts. Together, our findings suggest that, during voluntary load-lifting, optimal anticipatory muscle inhibition in the load-supporting forearm is achieved through reduced SMA excitability, mediated by beta bursts originating from an lPFC-M1-SMA network. To our knowledge, this also provides the first direct evidence that beta-band activity can exert inhibitory control over muscle function.\n\nSignificance statementAnticipatory motor control evolved in humans to perform precise, coordinated voluntary movements by compensating for the postural perturbations they generate. We investigated this behaviour using a bimanual postural task, in which accurate lifting of a load supported by the forearm relies on the anticipatory inhibition of ongoing postural command in the elbow flexors of the supporting arm. Our results suggest that beta bursts (22-28 Hz) mediate optimal anticipatory inhibition by suppressing activity in the Supplementary Motor Area associated with the initial control of the forearm, i.e., prior to load-lifting. These findings shed light on the neural mechanisms of motor anticipation and, to our knowledge, provide the first direct evidence that beta-band activity can exert inhibitory control over muscle function.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Tools exist to simplify SV datasets, but these SV mergers begin to fail on large or highly variable datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a new SV merger called SVCROWS (Structural Variation Consensus with Reciprocal Overlap and Weighted Sizes). This option-rich R package merges and summarizes SV regions using a size-weighted reciprocal overlap framework, effectively accounting for skewed impacts of variable-length SVs. User input directs stringency of comparisons across a range of sizes, enabling different levels of resolution in complex genome regions that harbor both small and large SVs. When compared to other SV merging programs, SVCROWS accurately merges SVs while maintaining less frequent genotypes of the unmerged SV calls. SVCROWS proves to be especially useful with large and highly variable single-cell datasets for enabling SV discovery. Overall, the novel size-weighted comparisons of SVCROWS presents a framework for improved interpretation of SV calls, and its ease of use allows it to be applied to virtually any upstream analyses.

Here, we show that in zebrafish, the geometry of the fertilized egg - specifically its curvature and volume - serves as a critical initial condition triggering a cascade of events that exert a lasting influence on development. Specifically, it guides asymmetric cell divisions in the blastoderm, generating radial gradients of cell volume and nucleocytoplasmic ratio. These gradients generate mitotic phase waves, with individual cell cycle periods determined largely cell-autonomously by the nucleocytoplasmic ratio. Modeling and perturbation experiments demonstrate that reducing cell autonomy reshapes these waves, emphasizing the instructive role of geometry-derived volume patterns in setting the intrinsic period of the cell cycle oscillator. Remarkably, in addition to organizing cell cycles, early embryo geometry also spatially patterns zygotic genome activation (ZGA) at the midblastula transition, a key step in establishing embryonic autonomy. Disrupting geometry alters the ZGA pattern and causes ectopic germ layer specification, underscoring its developmental significance.

EcDNA can drive tumor formation and evolution, contribute to drug resistance, and associate with poor patient survival outcomes. Beyond mediating high copy numbers, the circular topology and dynamic conformational changes of ecDNA disrupt topological domains and rewire regulatory networks, thereby conferring an important role in the transcriptional regulation of oncogenes. Here, we develop ec3D, a computational method for reconstructing the three-dimensional structures of ecDNA and analyzing significant interactions from high-throughput chromatin capture (Hi-C) data. Given a candidate ecDNA sequence and the corresponding whole-genome Hi-C as input, ec3D reconstructs the spatial structure of ecDNA by maximizing the Poisson likelihood of observed interactions. Ec3D's performance was validated using both simulated ecDNA structures with varying conformations, and Hi-C data from previously characterized cancer cell lines. Our reconstructions reveal that ecDNAs occupy spherical configurations and mediate unique long-range interactions involved in gene regulation. Through algorithmic innovations, ec3D can resolve complex ecDNA structures with duplicated genomic segments, identify multi-way interactions, distinguish between interactions arising from direct spatial proximity and secondary interactions resulting from alternative folding patterns or intermolecular (trans) contacts of ecDNA molecules.

Additionally, birds in the city are more sexually dichromatic than in the forest. Over the decade, colouration differences between habitats remain stable, following a similar quadratic temporal pattern. Finally, while climate has a weak effect on colouration, urban birds appear more sensitive to its influence than forest birds. Our results indicate urbanisation has a stronger impact than climate on great tit colouration, though both factors may interact. The heightened sensitivity of first-year birds and increased sexual dichromatism in cities may alter the strength of natural and sexual selection on this trait in urban environments.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "To understand the ecophysiology and the role of iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) in various ecosystems, we need to identify marker genes of the iron oxidation pathway to track activity in situ. The Gallionellaceae Sideroxydans sp. CL21, an autotrophic iron-oxidizing bacteria isolated from a peatland, is unusual amongst FeOB isolates in its genomic potential to utilize organic compounds as energy sources. Therefore, it offers the unique opportunity to determine genes expressed under litho- versus organotrophic conditions. We demonstrated the growth of Sideroxydans sp. CL21 on organic substrates (lactate and pyruvate) and inorganic substrates (Fe(II), magnetite, thiosulfate, and S(0)). Thus, cells were capable of lithoautotrophic, organotrophic, and potentially organoheterotrophic growth. Surprisingly, when lactate-grown cells were given Fe(II), mid-log phase cells were unable to oxidize iron, while late-log phase cells oxidized iron. To elucidate iron oxidation pathways, we compared gene expression between mid-log (non-iron-oxidizing) and late-log (iron-oxidizing) lactate-grown cells. Genes for iron oxidases (cyc2, mtoA) were highly expressed at both time points, so did not correspond to iron oxidation capability, making them unsuitable marker genes of iron oxidation activity by themselves. However, genes encoding periplasmic and inner membrane cytochromes were significantly upregulated in cells capable of iron oxidation. These genes include mtoD, cymA/imoA, and a cluster of Fe(II)-responsive genes (ircABCD). These findings suggest Gallionellaceae regulate their iron oxidation pathways in multiple stages, with iron oxidase-encoding genes proactively expressed. Other genes encoding electron carriers are upregulated only when iron oxidation is needed, which makes these genes (i.e. ircABCD) good prospective indicators of iron oxidation ability. Importance: FeOB are widespread in the environment and we suspect that they play key roles in nutrient and other elemental cycles. However, with no isotopic marker, we lack the ability to monitor FeOB activity, prompting us to search for genetic markers. Previous work suggests that expression of iron oxidase genes does not directly correspond to iron oxidation activity in Gallionellaceae and little was known about the other genes in the pathway. Here we study a unique FeOB isolate that possesses organotrophic capabilities and demonstrate its potential for mixotrophic growth on lactate and Fe(II). Its ability to oxidize iron is regulated, allowing us to discover potential iron oxidation pathway genes with expression that corresponds to iron oxidation activity. If these genes can be further validated as iron oxidation marker genes, they will enable us to delineate autotrophic and organoheterotrophic FeOB impacts on carbon cycling in wetlands and other natural and engineered environments.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Stopped-flow (SF) analysis (paper #1) of hemoglobin/oxyhemoglobin (Hb/HbO2) absorbance spectra during O2 efflux from intact murine RBCs show that membrane-impermeant inhibitor p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (pCMBS) reduces the HbO2-deoxygenation rate constant (kHbO2) by ~61%. SF experiments show that kHbO2 falls by (1) 9% for aquaporin-1 knockouts (AQP1-KOs), (2) 17% for Rhesus A-glycoprotein knockouts (RhAG-KOs), (3) 30% for double knockouts (dKOs), and (4) ~78% in dKOs/pCMBS.

Informed by automated-hematology data (paper #1) and imaging-flow-cytometry data (paper #2), simulations predict that observed kHbO2 decreases cannot reflect changes in RBC size/shape or [Hb/HbO2]. Instead, membrane O2 permeability (PM,O2) must fall by (1) 22% to account for AQP1-KO data, (2) 36% for RhAG-KOs, (3) 55% for dKOs, and (4) 91% for dKOs/pCMBS. Exploring predicted kHbO2 sensitivities to eight key parameters (e.g., [Hb/HbO2], diffusion constants, kHbO2 [-&gt;] Hb, thicknessEUF, diameterSphere) shows that no reasonable changes explain the kHbO2 data. We introduce a linear-combination approach to accommodate for the presence of poikilocytes.

In particular, neurite length is fundamental to study neuronal development and differentiation, neurons responses to drugs, neurodegenerative diseases and neuronal plasticity.

In this article, we present CABaNe, as an open source, high content, rule based Image J macro for cell analysis, including their neurite length. We explain the main steps, as well as guide users toward the use of this tool. This macro possess a graphical interface, metadata production, as well as verification means before and after analysis. Rule based and machine learning based programing have been tested for cell identification: After testing, we had better precision and adaptability using rule based cell identification. We challenged CABaNe with currently used techniques, which are manual or assisted. When tested on a small sample, CABaNe demonstrated a massive speed increase in capacity to treat dataset while maintaining or increasing precision when compared to manual measurement. When tested on a large data set, comparing different conditions, we successfully highlighted differences between conditions, in a fully automated and versatile manner. Therefore, CABaNe is viable as a high content option for cell analysis, for neurite length and other parameters, as well as a base of code for other analysis or to train deep learning models, using the output as annotation.

We investigated this issue using behavioral, fMRI, and EEG data. Studies 1A/1B examined semantic- and reward-processing PE using task-fMRI, yielding converging evidence of PE's global effects on large-scale connectivity: high-PE states broadly upregulated ventral-dorsal connectivity, and low-PE states upregulated posterior-anterior connectivity. Investigating whether these global patterns characterize cognition generally, Studies 2A/2B used resting-state fMRI and showed that individuals continuously fluctuate between ventral-dorsal (high-PE) and posterior-anterior (low-PE) dynamic connectivity states. Additionally, individual differences in PE task responses track differences in resting-state fluctuations, further endorsing that these fluctuations represent PE minimization at rest. Finally, Study 3 used combined fMRI-EEG and showed that these resting-state ventral-dorsal and posterior-anterior PE networks specifically oscillate at 3-6 Hz.

Despite the pivotal role of agriculture, plant health and survival are threatened by various biotic stressors. Although how plants respond to each of these individual stresses is well studied, little is known about how they respond to a combination of many of these bio-aggressors occurring together. To tackle this question, first, we built TomTom, a knowledge graph gathering molecular interactions from nine publicly available databases, including transcription factors- or microRNAs- targets, protein-protein interactions, and functional terms. Then, we selected transcriptomics data of tomato subjected to six distinct pathogens and performed an integrative analysis. We found 5561 candidate genes involved in the multi-stress response of tomato. To study how the response is orchestrated, we mapped those genes in TomTom and extracted a comprehensive gene regulatory network (GRN) composed of 71 transcription factors (TF) and 1786 target genes. By estimating the TF activity, we identified 43 TFs responding either specifically to one or multiple bio-aggressors. GRN analyses with a topological data analysis approach allowed to identify 18 clusters of TFs with similar properties, yielding four main configurations localized in specific regions of the GRN. Finally, we found one NAC and four ERF hubs which cooperatively coordinate the tomato response to multiple pathogens.

Mooney image recognition offers a compelling behavioral paradigm of this phenomenon, in which ambiguous black-and-white patterns are abruptly perceived as coherent objects. Whole-brain cortical involvement, which is mainly revealed by the contrast between recognition and nonrecognition, is well established. However, the neural dynamics underlying the transition from nonrecognition to recognition, particularly the contributions of noncortical structures, have remained largely unknown. Here, we show that the transition in whole-brain dynamics can be effectively characterized by three large-scale activity patterns and that the superior colliculus (SC) emerges as a structure with a distinct temporal profile that is potentially critical for insight. Using functional clustering of functional magnetic resonance imaging data comprising 41,446 time points from 14 human participants performing this insight task, we identified three distinct functional clusters exhibiting stimulus-driven activation, suppression, and recognition-associated patterns. Notably, the SC in the third cluster displayed a distinct activation peak immediately before the recognition response. Furthermore, empirical dynamic modeling revealed that the SC was the only region in the whole brain that exhibited mutual positive directed interactions with all three clusters and was functionally embedded within higher-order cortical interactions mediating the transformation from stimulus input to motor output. Our findings provide compelling experimental evidence that the SC plays a critical role in orchestrating whole-brain dynamics for sudden insight, calling for a reappraisal of this evolutionarily conserved structure as a key player supporting unconscious but high-level cognitive processing.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

It has been suggested that hybridisation can facilitate the speciation process by generating genetic diversity on which diversifying selection can act. Sailfin silverside fishes (Telmatherinidae) in the Malili Lakes system in Sulawesi have diversified within the last 2 million years. We assembled and annotated a chromosome-scale reference genome of the riverine sailfin silverside Telmatherina bonti and generated whole genome sequences of all species of Telmatherina in Lake Matano, South Sulawesi, Indonesia, one of the world's oldest and deepest lakes. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships within the adaptive radiation of sailfin silversides and inferred past and ongoing introgression patterns. Genome-wide tests confirmed two monophyletic clades, sharpfins and roundfins. However, within clades, we found mismatches between morphology-based taxonomic assignments and genome-wide genetic relationships. We found signs of both old and ongoing introgression between river-dwelling T. bonti and the lacustrine sharpfin group, as shown in elevated D-statistic, f4-ratio and f-branch statistic. Levels of excess allele sharing between riverine species and the three most common lacustrine species declined with increasing distance from the river-inlet, indicating ongoing introgression at the lake-river interface. This combination of past and ongoing hybridisation in a radiating species flock makes Lake Matano Telmatherina a particularly valuable system to study fundamental mechanisms driving rapid speciation under genomic exchange.

The virus primarily spreads through aerosol droplets released during breathing, coughing, or sneezing, leading to symptoms ranging from mild fever and cough to severe outcomes, including death. Given the high risk associated with COVID-19, understanding its behaviour in diverse geographical and environmental conditions is critical. Space exploration and tourism represent an emerging industry, projected to reach a market value of $1.8 trillion. With numerous space missions planned by space agencies such as NASA, SpaceX, and ISRO, it is vital to address potential health risks for astronauts and space tourists. Objective: With the expansion of human exploration into space, there is an urgent need to assess the risks posed by COVID-19 in extraterrestrial environments. This study reviews existing literature on airborne infections in space, identifies key knowledge gaps, and enhances preparedness for potential COVID-19 outbreaks during space missions. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify studies examining airborne infectious diseases in space and their health effects under microgravity. Databases searched included PubMed and NASA Open Data Portal. Additional systematic reviews were performed to analyze the known effects of these diseases on Earth using Pathogen Safety Data Sheets to compare these findings with Earth-based data. A separate systematic review was conducted using PubMed to explore similarities between COVID-19 and the selected airborne infectious diseases. Using a comparative approach, disease effects observed on Earth and in space were analyzed to predict COVID-19's potential behaviour in microgravity. Existing guidelines for managing airborne diseases in space and on Earth were reviewed and compared to develop preparedness recommendations for COVID-19 in space. Results: The airborne infectious diseases occurring in space found in this study include Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria bassiana, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae infections, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Roseolovirus (Human Herpesvirus 6 & 7), Salmonella Typhimurium infection, Serratia marcescens infection, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV). The relationship between the diseases above and COVID-19 was used to theorize the effects of COVID-19 in space. Six Tentative effects of COVID-19 in a microgravity environment could be theorized in this study. Along with that, recommendations to improve the current space travel health guidelines have also been referred to.

K.; Adams, P. J.; Assogba, B. D.", "abstract": "Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global crisis, causing 2.8 million infections and 35,000 deaths annually. Staphylococcus aureus is mainly responsible for causing these challenging infections through biofilm formation and the action of efflux pumps. A limited number of studies on Hop (Humulus lupulus) have shown its potential to inhibit quorum sensing in pathogenic bacteria. Objective: Therefore, a novel treatment approach was used in this study, which investigated Hop's {beta}-acids, particularly the combination of colupulone and n+adlupulone, as well as in combination with fluoroquinolone antibiotics ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. As ciprofloxacin remains a highly effective antibiotic against Staphylococcus aureus but resistance can develop, and ofloxacin exhibits naturally higher resistance in S. aureus, this study hypothesized that combining Hop (containing colupulone & n+adlupulone) with the two antibiotics separately would result in a greater reduction in biofilm growth of S. aureus compared to their individual potency levels. Methods: Antimicrobial activity was assessed using disk diffusion assays and minimum inhibitory concentration for biofilms at multiple concentrations through 2-fold serial dilutions. Results: Our data demonstrate that Hop-derived {beta}-acids possess direct antimicrobial activity and when combined with the fluoroquinolone antibiotics, exhibit additive or synergistic effects by acting on different targets in Staphylococcus aureus. Conclusions: This study provides insight into how natural products can potentially mitigate the development of resistance to antibiotics like ciprofloxacin in the highly pathogenic bacterium S. aureus. It also highlights how adding natural compounds could improve drug effectiveness. Therefore, this demonstrates the potential of natural compounds and antibiotics like ofloxacin, which are known to be ineffective against S. aureus.

Here, we combined crystallography, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), molecular dynamics simulations, and network analysis to uncover the structural dynamics and communication pathways within hcis-PT. By solving the apo structure of hcis-PT, we reveal only a localized flexibility at the active site and the NgBR C-terminus. However, HDX-MS demonstrated widespread substrate-induced stabilization, particularly at the NgBR {beta}D-{beta}E loop, highlighting it as an allosteric hub. Functional mutagenesis scanning identified NgBRS249 as critical for enzymatic activity, independent of structural perturbations. Network analysis of MD simulations pinpointed this residue as a central node in inter-subunit communication, with perturbations disrupting downstream allosteric pathways, altering enzymatic activity.

We recently demonstrated (by differential proteomics, western blot and immunohistochemistry) that the expression of cofilin 1 and its inactive phosphorylated form are dynamically regulated in the mouse visual cortex during postnatal development and by visual experience. Moreover, we found that cofilin 1 expression levels correlates with periods of heightened plasticity in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we analyzed whether the pharmacological modulation of cofilin 1 activity affects plasticity processes in the visual cortex. Adult mice were treated with a synthetic peptide inhibitor of cofilin 1 activity (PCOF) or a control peptide (TAT) and then monocularly deprived of vision during 3 days. Following reopening of the deprived eye, structural plasticity was assessed by quantifying dendritic spine density using Golgi-like staining, and visual plasticity was evaluated by measuring visual acuity through the optomotor response test. Our results show that, in adult mice treated with the PCOF peptide - but not in controls - monocular deprivation led to a significant reduction in dendritic spine density in the contralateral visual cortex, as well as a decrease in visual acuity of the previously deprived eye.

Although deoxycholate treatment perturbed K/Na homeostasis in B. fragilis, deletion of clsA or clsB did not significantly alter intracellular ion levels, suggesting that cardiolipin loss does not substantially impact ion balance under standard cultivation conditions. High-resolution lipidomic analyses showed that cardiolipin comprises less than 1% of B. fragilis membranes and that ClsA and ClsB produce distinct cardiolipin products with unique acyl chain lengths and levels of unsaturation. Deletion of either cls gene led to Cls-specific remodeling of B. fragilis envelope lipid content, which was also associated with shifts in non-lipid metabolites indicative of stress-induced metabolic changes. These results define distinct roles for ClsA and ClsB in shaping B. fragilis membrane composition, metabolism, and stress resilience, and highlight cardiolipin as a key determinant of fitness under bile acid stress.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

IFN{gamma} is a pleiotropic cytokine, its expression dynamics and precise role in CTL-mediated cytotoxicity remain incompletely understood. To investigate the relationship between IFN{gamma} expression and CTL cytotoxicity, we analyzed IFN{gamma} production, subcellular localization, cellular subtypes, degranulation capacity, and early activation markers in IFN{gamma}-expressing CTLs. First, we found that IFN{gamma} expression was rapid, transient, and required secondary T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, whereas GzmB was pre-stored in resting CTLs. Notably, two distinct IFN{gamma}-expressing subsets, IFN{gamma}hi and IFN{gamma}lo, were identified, while only a single GzmB-expressing population was observed. Subsequently, we classified IFN{gamma}-expressing CTLs into effector/effector memory (TE/TEM) and central memory (TCM) subsets. IFN{gamma}hi cells exhibited a predominantly TE/TEM phenotype, whereas IFN{gamma}lo cells showed reduced effector characteristics and a higher proportion of TCM. Next, degranulation assays revealed that IFN{gamma}hi CTLs displayed significantly higher surface expression of the lytic granule marker CD107a (33.75%) compared to IFN{gamma}lo CTLs (3.76%), despite comparable intracellular GzmB levels. This suggests that elevated IFN{gamma} production correlates with CTL killing capacity. Further analysis demonstrated that IFN{gamma}hi CTLs exhibited extensive colocalization with cis-Golgi and GzmB, indicating robust IFN{gamma} synthesis and efficient sorting of mature IFN{gamma} into cytotoxic granules (CGs) relative to IFN{gamma}lo CTLs. Finally, we compared IFN{gamma} and CRTAM expression in naive versus activated CD8+ T cells upon TCR stimulation, demonstrating that transient CRTAM expression may critically regulate initial CTL activation and IFN{gamma} production.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

A major contributor to the increasing resistance is the dissemination of mobile antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) among bacterial communities. These genes are ubiquitously present in various environments and are especially diverse in the human gut and wastewater. Despite this, the clinical implications of the prevalence of ARGs in these bacterial communities remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate how the prevalence of ARGs in human gut and wastewater microbiomes reflects their dissemination among important bacterial pathogens. To do this, we estimated the prevalence of >30,000 ARGs, including both well-known (established) and computationally predicted (latent) genes, in >6,000 metagenomic samples. From their prevalence in the human gut and wastewater, we identified four categories of ARGs: co-promoted, human gut (HG)-promoted, wastewater (WW)-promoted, and non-promoted. Our results showed that co-promoted ARGs were by far the most promiscuous, being more frequently found across multiple bacterial phyla, and more often co-localized with broad host range conjugative elements. Co-promoted ARGs were also found to be overrepresented among genes identified in multiple pathogenic species and exhibited an overall higher genetic compatibility with both pathogens and other typical residents of the human gut and wastewater microbiomes. Taken together, our results highlight the link between the promotion of ARGs in the human gut and wastewater microbiomes and their presence in human pathogens, and, thereby, the genes potential risk to human health.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Nevertheless, many widely-used analysis methods, such as analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and methods for estimating phylogenetic trees using nucleotide divergence (dXY) still lack the probabilistic frameworks necessary to accommodate GLs.\n\nResultsWe introduce ngsAMOVA, a novel probabilistic framework for analyzing molecular variation in population hierarchies with low- and medium-depth sequencing data. It employs an Expectation Maximization algorithm to first estimate the joint genotype probabilities for pairs of individuals, accounting for genotype uncertainty using GLs. It then uses these estimates to generate a pairwise distance matrix, which can be used for AMOVA, estimation of dXY, and for estimating phylogenetic trees using Neighbor-Joining. Hypothesis testing is facilitated using genomic block-bootstrapping. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that ngsAMOVA provides more accurate results compared to genotype calling at low and medium read depths. Overall, ngsAMOVA represents a methodological advance in the analysis of molecular variance and divergence under sequencing uncertainty.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are crucial post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, fine tuning protein levels to maintain cellular homeostasis.

Small RNA sequencing identified exercise specific miRs, including increased levels of cel-miR-57-5p and cel-miR-249-3p, and decreased cel-miR-72-3p and cel-miR-77-5p. mir-57 and mir-249 mutant strains had enhanced fertility, survival and lifespan, whereas mir-72 and mir-77 mutant strains had diminished fertility, survival and lifespan. Interestingly both miR-77 and mir-249 mutant strains had disrupted mitochondrial morphology and reduced fitness following exercise.

S.", "abstract": "Cross-feeding, a phenomenon in which organisms share metabolites, is frequently observed in microbial communities across the natural world. One of the most common forms is waste-product cross-feeding, a unidirectional interaction in which the waste products of one microbe support the growth of another. Despite its ubiquity, it is not well-understood why waste-product cross-feeding persists when a single organism could in principle perform both the producer and consumer role. To address this question, we first analyze cross-feeding evolution in a minimal model of microbial metabolism. The model describes multi-step extraction of energy from a substrate in a simple but thermodynamically correct formulation. Surprisingly, we find that cross-feeding is never evolutionarily stable in this model. By analyzing models with more complex growth functions, we identify a novel mechanism for the evolutionary stability of waste-product cross-feeding, namely, generalized intracellular metabolite toxicity. Such toxicity arises because, in excess, the same intracellular metabolites that cells require for metabolism can be detrimental to growth (e.g., due to osmotic stress). We show that some but not all forms of such toxicity can lead to evolutionarily stable consortia of microbes that cross-feed waste products. This stability results from the potential of such consortia to divide the burden of toxic metabolites among a larger population, allowing them to perform their collective metabolism more efficiently than non-cross-feeders. More generally, we predict that growth penalties that scale nonlinearly with intracellular metabolite levels promote cross-feeding. We find that this mechanism for cross-feeding evolutionary stability implies nontrivial population dynamics, such as a discontinuity in population biomass at the onset of cross-feeding.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

In mammals, DNA methylation in regulatory regions, such as promoters, primarily regulates gene expression by inducing transcriptional inactivation. With genome-wide approaches came the realization that DNA methylation patterns underlying mammalian development are considerably more dynamic than previously recognized. This realization highlights the need for methodological approaches capable of capturing this phenomenon. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of modeling DNA methylation networks by jointly estimating regularized precision matrices from time- and tissue-specific omics data derived from the pig genome. For that, we utilized RNA-Seq and RRBS data that span seven pig tissues at three developmental stages: early organogenesis, late organogenesis, and newborn. Our analysis focused on 61, 48, and 74 genes -- differentially expressed across developmental stages and CpG-methylated in promoter regions, from endoderm-, mesoderm-, and ectoderm-derived tissues, respectively. Using a joint fused ridge approach, we were able to borrow information across tissues and time points, enabling more robust network inference. This analytical framework advances exploratory methods for studying organism development using pig as a model species. Our results highlight the importance of fetal-maternal immunity and the circulatory system in early development, and shed light on dynamic interactions across tissues, organ systems, and germ layers.

The primary end products of indigestible carbohydrate fermentation are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). We hypothesized that increased dietary fiber consumption could lead to greater SCFA production in the human gut. To investigate this, we examined the relationship between complex carbohydrate intake, CAZyme activity in the human gut microbiome, and SCFA production at the whole metagenomic level across three cohorts: a healthy reference-controlled cohort, an average cohort of individuals living in industrialized cities, and a cohort of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were utilized to assess the diversity, abundance, and functionality of CAZymes, as well as the metabolic capacity for SCFA production. The average cohort exhibited higher alpha diversity of CAZyme families compared to the reference-controlled cohort, although subfamily composition was similar between both. A moderate negative correlation was identified between CAZyme abundance and SCFA production, indicating that a higher number of these enzymes does not directly translate to increased SCFA synthesis. In IBD patients, a decrease in the diversity and composition of CAZyme subfamilies was observed, suggesting a disruption in enzymatic functions associated with the disease. However, the overall functionality of CAZymes remained relatively stable across different health conditions, highlighting the resilience of the gut microbiome for these functions. These findings deepen our understanding of the gut microbiome role in health and disease, emphasizing that despite variations in microbial diversity, key enzymatic functions persist.

Here, we report that LMD-3, a LysM domain protein, regulates proteostasis and reproductive capacity in C. elegans. The deficiency of lmd-3 leads to striking defects in oxidation resistance and constitutively high cellular stress responses, such as ER stress response and cytosolic stress response. We demonstrate that lysosome-localized LMD-3 protein interacts with vitellogenin and V-type ATPase, which drives proton-transporting and lysosomal lumen acidification. LMD-3 regulation of lysosomal function is essential for maintaining yolk protein homeostasis and reproductive health. We also identify that vitamin B12 (meCbl) supplementation revert the fecundity decline of lmd-3 mutants by reducing oxidative stress and improving lysosomal function.

Using this assay, we demonstrate that the sequential use of FCCP and sodium azide leads to an increase in the sodium azide-treated (non-mitochondrial) OCR, indicating that the sequential use of respiratory inhibitors, as standard in intact cell respirometry, may produce erroneous estimates of non-mitochondrial respiration in C. elegans and thus should be avoided.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Synthesized de novo in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through a tightly regulated enzymatic pathway, ceramides can also be generated from hydrolysis complex sphingolipids, including hexosylceramides and sphingomyelins, and the salvage pathway. Their dynamic turnover across distinct cellular compartments results in spatial regulation of ceramide levels and its functional consequences. Mitochondrial ceramide accumulation, in particular, is a critical factor of apoptosis, where ceramides can disrupt membrane integrity. In addition to apoptosis, ceramides are implicated in replicative senescence. However, the mechanisms of ceramide regulation and function in senescence remain incompletely understood. In this study, we employed comparative lipid profiling, gene expression analysis and Raman spectroscopy to dissect sphingolipid regulatory networks that might be responsible for ceramide regulation and localization in senescence. We found that while both apoptotic and senescent cells exhibit elevated ceramide levels, only senescent cells display a marked depletion of sphingomyelins, especially very-long-chain species. Despite transcriptional upregulation of sphingomyelin synthase 1, enzymatic activity remained unchanged, suggesting impaired ceramide transport. Pharmacological inhibition of Ceramide Transfer Protein (CERT), the ER to Golgi ceramide transporter, phenocopied the senescent sphingolipid profile and enhanced senescence markers. Furthermore, Raman spectroscopy revealed ceramide accumulation at the ER but not the mitochondria in senescent cells, consistent with a non-apoptotic phenotype.

Upon mitochondrial membrane potential disruption, PINK1 phosphorylation activates the ubiquitin ligase parkin which ubiquitinates various mitochondrial protein substrates. These feed-forward modifications on the mitochondria surface attract ubiquitin-binding autophagy receptors that target ubiquitinated mitochondria to autophagosomes and indirectly contribute to phagophore elongation. Investigating post-translational protein modifications during this process, we detected transient ubiquitination of K549 within the third coiled-coil domain (CC3) of TAX1BP1 in HeLa cells expressing WT but not catalytically inactive parkin. Parkin-dependent ubiquitination did not target TAX1BP1 to proteasomal degradation but was rather indicative of a regulatory modification. In cells with the full complement of autophagy receptors, TAX1BP1 plays only a minor role in mitophagy. However, when expressed as a sole autophagy receptor, both WT and ubiquitination deficient TAX1BP1 were capable of promoting mitophagy, albeit mitochondria degradation was slightly delayed under mutant conditions. Use of the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A indicated classical autophagolysosomal targeting of damaged mitochondria mediated by WT TAX1BP1. However, for the ubiquitination-deficient TAX1BP1, we observed an increased prevalence of enlarged endolysosomal vesicles carrying accumulated TAX1BP1-positive autophagosomes filled with mitochondrial material. Thus, while ubiquitination of the CC3 domain of TAX1BP1 is not essential for complete mitophagy, the lack of CC3 in TAX1BP1 reroutes the degradation flux to a less efficient endolysosmal degradative pathway.

Our investigation into epigenetic changes during myocardial aging revealed that the repressive epigenetic mark H3K27me3 is significantly upregulated in aged mice and humans. This increase in H3K27me3 was shown to impair cardiomyocyte autophagy and drive metabolic reprogramming, key features of myocardial aging and causatively linked to dysfunction. Notably, by alleviating this repressive mark through a modified diet, we successfully mitigated the aged myocardial phenotype. Methods: Heart tissue from young and aged mice and humans was analyzed for H3K27me3 levels using immunoblotting and immunofluorescence staining. Genes regulated by H3K27me3 were identified through CUT&RUN-Seq and RNA-Seq, while metabolites were profiled using metabolomics. In neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), H3K27me3 levels were elevated by siRNA-mediated knockdown of UTX. Cellular metabolism was investigated using a Seahorse analyzer in cardiomyocytes with basal or elevated H3K27me3 levels. In further human studies, we assessed how circulating glutamine levels associate with the incidence of heart failure and the association of genetic variants within the SLC1A5 region with heart disease. In aged mice, H3K27me3 levels were reduced through a modified diet, and heart function was evaluated using echocardiography. Subsequently, hearts were processed for biochemical analysis, and autophagy was assessed using electron microscopy Results: H3K27me3 was significantly elevated in the aged mouse and human myocardium. This observed elevation in H3K27me3 was found to be attributed to impaired glutamine metabolism, resulting from reduced expression of the glutamine transporter SLC1A5 in the aged myocardium. Furthermore, elevation in H3K27me3 was found to contribute to impaired cardiomyocyte autophagy and metabolic dysfunction. In aged mice supplemented with a high glutamine diet this attenuated myocardial H3K27me3 and improved cardiac function. Furthermore, a high-glutamine diet reversed H3K27me3-mediated impairment in cardiac autophagy in aged mice. Conclusions: Reduction in SLC1A5 during aging is likely to lead to increased myocardial H3K27me3 that results in impaired autophagy and metabolic reprogramming that contribute to the aged cardiac phenotype. Our findings also suggest glutamine may improve cardiac health in the aged population by lowering H3K27me3.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

MR1 ligands can originate in the extracellular space or in endosomal compartments that contain microbial pathogens. Distinct, complementary antigen processing and presentation pathways enable MR1 to survey diverse intracellular locations and present both exogenous and intracellular antigens. Here, we generated a panel of BEAS-2B MR1 KO cells reconstituted with MR1 proteins mutated at amino acids 9-16. The mutated MR1 molecules differentially translocated to the cell surface in response to 6-formylpterin and differed in their ability to present mycobacterial antigens to MAIT cell clones. While they barely presented Mycobacterium smegmatis supernatant and other exogenous MAIT cell antigens, their ability to present antigens derived from mycobacterial infection and a 5-A-RU prodrug requiring endosomal processing remained largely intact. Protein co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis showed that mutated MR1 differentially associated with calnexin and {beta}2-microglobulin (B2M). Knock-down of B2M in cells over-expressing MR1 phenocopied the loss of exogenous antigen presentation but did not impact presentation of intracellular antigens. Thus, the MR1-mediated presentation of exogenous antigen appears to be limited by binding to B2M whereas the lower sensitivity to B2M deficiency implies that MAIT cell activation via the endosomal antigen presentation pathway may be limited by the availability of MR1 itself.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Whether and how species outside this single eukaryotic group can generate contractile actin networks has been largely unexplored. We demonstrate that Naegleria, an amoeba from the Heterolobosea--an evolutionarily distant eukaryotic lineage that includes the fastest known crawling eukaryotes--expresses three distinct Myosin 2 homologs. Using biochemical assays and immunofluorescence, we show that these Myosin 2 proteins bind cellular actin networks and that these networks generate ATP-dependent contractility. By identifying additional Myosin 2 homologs in dozens of additional heterolobosean amoebae (but not obligate flagellates), we find a widespread correlation within this group between crawling behavior and contractile actin networks. This correlation includes the amoeba Vahlkampfia avara, which we demonstrate can crawl at speeds exceeding 180 m/min and has contractile actin networks and Myosin 2 homologs. These findings show that Myosin 2-driven contractility exists beyond Amorphea and is associated with diverse, fast-crawling cell types. Expanding the taxonomic breadth of actin network contractility impacts our basic understanding of cell motility, evolutionary biology, and of the fundamental biology of human pathogens that rely on fast cell migration.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Adipocyte-specific deletion of BUD23 in mice regulates lipid and mitochondrial metabolism resulting in a pronounced lean phenotype and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Mechanistically, BUD23 modulates translation initiation and efficiency of mRNAs with specific features - including short 5' UTR length and GC-rich post-initiation codon usage - characteristic of mitochondrial and lipogenic proteins.

S.", "abstract": "DNA methylation is a key epigenetic regulator often disrupted in cancer, yet how promoter methylation dynamics translate into transcriptional changes during cancer progression remains incompletely understood. Here, we employed targeted bisulfite sequencing and RNA-seq on paired tumor and non-tumor tissues from 80 Korean colorectal cancer (CRC) patients to map promoter methylation and gene expression dynamics. Promoters with high baseline methylation in non-tumor tissues tended to become hypomethylated in tumors, while those with low baseline methylation underwent partial hypermethylation. However, these changes did not consistently correlate with gene silencing or activation. Strikingly, promoters marked by Polycomb (PcG) in non-tumor tissue were prone to hypermethylation yet often remained transcriptionally active in tumors, a paradox most prominent in transcription factor (TF) genes. In contrast, hypermethylation in PcG- promoters was more consistently associated with transcriptional repression. Our findings suggest that epigenetic plasticity at PcG TF gene promoters can override the typically repressive effects of DNA methylation, potentially enabling tumors to maintain or enhance the expression of key regulatory genes. This highlights the importance of PcG occupancy in shaping the functional consequences of methylation changes during colorectal tumorigenesis, warranting deeper investigation into how these epigenetic adaptations drive cancer progression.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Among neutral ASOs, peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) have been extensively studied as potential medical treatments for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), a severe genetic disease that causes muscle degeneration progressively. Over the last few decades, many in silico methods have emerged to detect novel CPPs, counterbalancing the cost of wet-lab experiments. Results: In this study, we propose CPP2Vec, a Word2Vec-based CPP prediction method, where the Word2Vec technique is used to represent amino acid sequences of peptides. We developed three task-specific supervised machine learning models for CPP-Classification, Uptake-Efficiency and PMO-Delivery. The first two models were designed to determine if an unseen peptide is a CPP and to predict its uptake efficiency, respectively, while the PMO-Delivery model predicts if a peptide could enhance the cellular delivery of a PMO-complex compared to its naked version. Furthermore, we explored an alternative approach using pretrained protein-based Large Language Models (LLMs) - T5, BERT, and ESM-2 - to generate the embeddings, resulting in three task-specific models, namely CPP2LLM. A comparison of CPP2Vec and CPP2LLM with state-of-the-art CPP prediction tools is included, proving their significant predictive performance. Conclusion: In this research, we present a Machine Learning (ML)-based tool that introduces the use of the Word2Vec technique in the field of CPPs prediction.

Results: Here, we introduce SWANS (v2.0), a configurable analysis pipeline that, in a single run, can employ multiple analysis methods, resolutions, and modifiable parameters. The resulting clustering arrangements, differential gene expression results, and other quantitative measurements can be dynamically visualized and compared in a Shiny interactive report to assist in choosing a single analysis schema for annotation and downstream analysis. Once a final approach is chosen, SWANS will perform differential gene expression (DGE) analysis based on experimental conditions and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in addition to creating reports that display figures and interactive tables, quality control metrics, and benchmarking information. SWANS uses Snakemake as a workflow manager, Cell Ranger for alignment and gene expression quantification, Seurat for single cell data analysis, and additional single cell R packages for quality control and downstream single cell analysis.

Proteins were extracted from characterized mouse models and subjected to mass spectrometry and subsequent bioinformatics analysis. The results revealed that the differentially enriched signaling pathways in treated female mice were mainly belonged to the constituent of cytoskeleton, and mitochondria, including metabolic and oxidoreductase activity clusters. The enriched signaling pathways in treated male mice were related to translation, ribosomal structural and binding subunits and mRNA binding, metabolic processes, glutathione transferase activity, oxidoreductase activity, and mitochondrial activity. Protein-protein interaction analysis revealed the top ten genes ranked by highest maximal clique centrality. Survival Analysis using UACLAN indicated that among the hub genes of DEN-treated female mice, only the upregulation of NDUFA8 was associated with patient survival. In DEN-treated male mice downregulation of EEF2 and upregulation of RPL7A, RPL18A, RPL27A, RPS3, RPS 11 and SERBP1 was associated with poor survival.

Using calcium imaging in behaving flies, we find that a hair plate on the fly coxa (CxHP8) detects the limits of anterior leg movement. Reconstructing CxHP8 axons in the connectome, we found that they are wired to excite posterior leg movement and inhibit anterior leg movement. Consistent with this connectivity, optogenetic activation of CxHP8 neurons elicited posterior postural reflexes, while silencing altered the swing-to-stance transition during walking. Finally, we use comprehensive reconstruction of peripheral morphology and downstream connectivity to predict the function of other hair plates distributed across the fly leg. Our results suggest that each hair plate is specialized to control specific sensorimotor reflexes that are matched to the joint limit it detects.

The best-characterized mechanism employed by HCMV to suppress host immunity is the production of a viral interleukin-10 homolog (CMVIL-10). While CMVIL-10 is known to suppress immune responses and promote viral persistence, its capacity to promote increased susceptibility to co-infecting pathogens like Aspergillus fumigatus remains unknown. Therefore, we studied the impact of wild-type (WT) HCMV (strain TB40 BAC4), a CMVIL-10-deficient HCMV mutant ({Delta}UL111A), and recombinant CMVIL-10 on the immune activity of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs) during co-infection with A. fumigatus. Using a combination of transcriptomic and phenotypic readouts, our data revealed a strong and time-dependent immuno-paralytic effect of HCMV by suppressing pathogen recognition pathways, cytokine production, DC maturation, and expression of genes that are essential for host defense and tissue repair. Although infection with {Delta}UL111A lacking CMVIL-10 led to stronger expression of type I interferons, IFN-{gamma}-inducible chemokines, and proinflammatory cytokines than WT infection, interference with antifungal immune defense and fungal clearance during co-infection was largely similar between both strains. The limited effect of CMVIL-10 on antifungal immune defense persisted even after prolonged pre-exposure of DCs to the recombinant virokine. In summary, although CMVIL-10 contributes to shaping an anti-inflammatory environment, HCMV's suppression of antifungal immunity appears to be multifactorial, with CMVIL-10 alone playing a rather subtle role in altering DC responses to A. fumigatus during viral-fungal co-infection.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Model personalization involves adjusting global and local parameters representing the excitability of individual brain areas, using an evolutionary algorithm that aims to maximize the correlation between empirical and synthetic functional connectivity matrices derived from SEEG data. The resulting personalized models successfully reproduce individual seizure propagation patterns and can be used to simulate therapeutic interventions like surgery, stimulation, or pharmacological interventions within a unified physiological framework. Notably, model predictions reveal distinct patient-specific responses across interventions, highlighting the potential of whole-brain modeling to guide individualized treatment by identifying accessible and functionally relevant targets.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Considered too ephemeral, these crops are nevertheless responsible for the absorption and storage of approximately one-third of the carbon biofixed by photosynthesis, with half-lives that are not limited to a single season but extend on average over 8.9 years. The kinetics of variation in carbon capture and release by cultivated plants over the half-century were simulated using two error functions which made it possible to complete the probabilistic calculation of the carbon balance components. In 2023, all cultivated plants crops, grasslands, and forest plantations had a stored carbon half-life of 17.6 years. They had removed 39.2 billion tonnes of CO2/year from the atmosphere, more than global emissions from hydrocarbon combustion. Simulation of time distribution suggests that cultivated plants would have constituted a net stock of 124 billion tons of carbon by 2023, based on 455 billion tons of CO2 removed from the atmosphere, or 14% of its atmospheric mass. Given the importance of carbon capture and storage by cultivated plants, both in duration and quantity, rural activities should be integrated into carbon balances and the resulting climate strategies and recognized as a carbon capture and storage (CCS) device in carbon cycle regulation policies. This recognition would allow for the fair valuation of the work of farmers and foresters as part of the ecological transition, particularly through remuneration mechanisms such as carbon credits.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

These include the cytochrome c oxydase subunit I (COI) for metazoans, ITS for fungi and plants or the 16S rRNA for bacteria and archaea. It has been shown to be more accurate than more traditional methods such as morphology, making it a now widespread method for species delimitation. The development of new sequencing methods such as Nanopore sequencing becoming more affordable and accurate has led to a growing use of those methods and a need for fast, standardized and cheap protocol. Although Sanger sequencing has become superseded by next-generation sequencing for most genomic applications, using second or third-generation sequencing for amplicons remains an expensive and time-consuming approach, especially for laboratories that analyse many different markers. Amplicon sequencing typically occurs in the context of either DNA barcoding (sequencing one or a few markers of interest for each specimen in a collection) or DNA metabarcoding (investigating the composition of a community by using universal primers targeting a whole group of organisms). Pooling the resulting PCR products for e.g. Nanopore sequencing requires the use of barcodes that are generally added to amplicons once they are amplified (using either ligation or a second round of amplification), and these supplementary steps are time-consuming, expensive and prone to contamination. To alleviate these issues, we present here a quick, single-tube two-step PCR with four primers: two internal primers with tails, and two external barcode primers that anneal on the tails during the second phase of the PCR. we show an improved 4 primers PCR protocol by using a single tube \"drop in the lid\" method. 8 DNA extract from Asellus. sp were obtained and amplified using both, 2-step PCR and the 1-step PCR.

While genetic associations with body composition traits are well-studied, less is known about the role of epigenetic mechanisms, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where the burden of cardiometabolic disease is high. We investigated links between DNA methylation and three compartments of body composition: fat mass, lean mass, and bone measures using data from children enrolled in the Epigenetic Mechanisms linking Pre-conceptional nutrition and Health Assessed in India and Sub-Saharan Africa (EMPHASIS) study. Results We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of 11 body composition traits assessed through dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in children from India (age = 5-7 years, n = 686) and The Gambia (age = 7-9 years, n = 289), with blood DNA methylation measured at approximately 800,000 CpGs sites on on the Illumina EPIC array. Cohort-specific analysis identified 15 unique differentially methylated CpGs (dmCpGs) associated with traits across all three compartments of body composition (p<3.6x10-8). Cross-cohort meta-analysis revealed 4 loci associated with lean mass and bone area. Notably, dmCpGs mapping to the SOCS3 gene, previously linked to height in Indian, African and European populations, were associated with lean mass and bone area in both the Indian cohort and combined meta-analyses. Region-level EWAS identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs), linked to lean mass and bone area mapping to SOCS3 and P4HB genes overlapping identified dmCpGs associated with the same phenotypes.

Using adult zebrafish, we sought to determine whether factors like strain, sex, and personality might contribute to the variable effects of J. sambac on anxiety-related behavior. The flowers of J. sambac were extracted by ultrasonic-assisted extraction with optimal air pressure. Headspace solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) identified the main components in the Arabian jasmine flower extract, including linalool (an anxiolytic compound) and benzaldehyde. We fed three strains of zebrafish (AB, TL, and WIK) a gelatin pellet containing different concentrations of J. sambac (5-20 mg kg-1) and assessed 3-dimensional swim behavior in the novel tank and mirror biting tests. We found that in female AB fish, J. sambac resulted in a decrease in bottom distance during the novel tank test, consistent with an anxiogenic effect; there was no effect in WIK or TL fish. We also found that behavioral/personality type influenced the effects of J. sambac where shy AB females increased their percent explored, consistent with an anxiolytic effect.

Loss-of-function mutations in SUR1 and Kir6.2, encoded by ABCC8 and KCNJ11, respectively are the commonest causes of severe persistent hypoglycemia in infants and children seen in the rare disease congenital hyperinsulinism (HI). The N-terminal transmembrane domain, TMD0, and the linker immediately C-terminal to TMD0, L0, of SUR1 (TMD0/L0) forms direct contact with Kir6.2 in KATP channels. Mutations in SUR1-TMD0 often impair KATP channel trafficking to the plasma membrane, causing severe disease unresponsive to treatment by the KATP activator diazoxide; however, surface expression and function of many such mutant channels can be rescued by reversible KATP inhibitor pharmacochaperones. Here, we identified seven new SUR1 missense mutations in TMD0/L0 from HI patients unresponsive to diazoxide and investigated their effects on KATP channel expression, function, and response to pharmacochaperones. All seven mutations, N32K, Y124F, P133R, W143R, L171P, G228D, and Y230C, reduced channel function in Rb+ efflux assays. Further characterization by immunoblotting, immunostaining and electrophysiology revealed that Y124F primarily causes defective channel gating, while the others impair channel trafficking to different extents. The trafficking mutations showed varied response to surface expression and function rescue by the reversible KATP inhibitor pharmacochaperones, tolbutamide and Aekatperone. The study underscores the critical role of SUR1-TMD0/L0 in KATP expression and gating. It further highlights the importance of detailed biochemical and functional studies of mutant channels in understanding their pathogenic roles and response to potential pharmacological therapies.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Notable methods like AlphaFold 3 and RosettaTTAFold All-Atom exist, but they are inefficient and inherently struggle at modeling conformationally unstable proteins, such as transcription factors, which arguably represent the most important class of DNA-binding proteins.

Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.591 on a low identity set, outperforming state-of-the-art structure-based methods.

Serostatus against RVFV was determined using a competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (cELISA) for dog and cattle samples, and a Multiplex Bead Assay (MBA) for human samples. Serocatalytic models fitted to age-stratified serological data were developed to estimate the RVF force of infection (FOI) under several hypotheses, ranging from no relationship to proportional FOIs between humans, cattle, and dogs. Antibodies to RVFV were detected in 23 of 513 dogs (4.5%; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): [2.9 - 6.7]), in 86 of 486 humans (17.7%; 95% CI: [14.4 - 21.4]), and in 33 of 135 cattle (24.4%; 95% CI: [17.5 - 32.6]).

Here, we aimed to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Whole cell patch clamp studies revealed that 24 h incubation of dystrophic (mdx) ventricular cardiomyocytes with EMPA significantly increases peak INa in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50=94 nM). The enhancing effect on peak INa also occurred in dystrophic cardiac Purkinje fibers, Nav1.5-expressing tsA201 cells, as well as in dystrophic (DMDmdx) rat cardiomyocytes, and was also exerted by two other SGLT2 inhibitors. Immunofluorescence studies suggested that chronic EMPA treatment increases Nav1.5 plasma membrane expression. Peak INa enhancement by EMPA depended on functional anterograde trafficking of Nav1.5. The local anesthetic mexiletine, a well-known pharmacological chaperone of Nav1.5, enhanced peak INa in a similar manner as EMPA. Further, mutation of human Nav1.5 at a site important for local anesthetic binding (Y1767A) completely abolished the ability of both EMPA and mexiletine to enhance peak INa. Finally, the importance of Y1767 for drug-induced modulation of peak INa was confirmed by molecular docking simulations.

Clinical features include ventricular tachyarrhythmias, fibro-fatty infiltration of both ventricles, and ultimately dilated cardiomyopathy. While some data have been gathered to explain the electrophysiological and contractile consequences of desmoplakin cardiomyopathy, a comprehensive mechanism linking DSP mutations to ventricular dilation and heart failure remains elusive. Methods We use iPSC-derived engineered heart tissue (EHT) bearing a functional desmoplakin haploinsufficiency to model the heart failure phenotype that occurs in desmoplakin cardiomyopathy. Functional haploinsufficiency is secondary to a missense mutation, R451G, that results in proteolytic degradation of desmoplakin with no detectable protein. We complement functional data obtained in tissue-engineered constructs with cell biology assays in 2D cardiomyocytes to glean insights into the mechanism and mechanobiology of desmoplakin cardiomyopathy. Results Engineered heart tissues harboring a desmoplakin insufficiency recapitulate a patient phenotype notable for hypocontractility and ventricular dilation. Surprisingly, DSP-mutant tissues exhibited a shortened resting sarcomere length that was dependent on protein kinase C activity. Concurrently, mechanical load on -catenin was increased, suggesting a mechanism by which desmosomal insufficiency redistributes force to adherens junctions. Excessive loading on adherens junctions may act as a stimulus for avid insertion of series sarcomeres, shortening the length per sarcomere, and resulting in a contractile deficit. PKC inhibition rescues shortened sarcomere length in DSP-mutant tissues, suggesting that it could be a target for future molecular therapies. Conclusions Our study uncovers a novel mechanism underlying systolic dysfunction in desmoplakin cardiomyopathy.

K.; Kato, N.; Larkin, J. C. C.", "abstract": "In Arabidopsis, SIAMESE (SIM) is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that restricts progression through mitosis. SIM is well known as a regulator of endoreplication in trichomes and roots. Mathematical modeling of the cell cycle has indicated that SIM may also modulate the length of G2 during mitotic cycles, potentially replacing the WEE1/CDC25 circuit that regulates G2 timing in animals and fungi, which is absent in plants. The predictions of this model were tested in several ways. First, the root meristem is longer in sim mutant roots than in wild-type (WT) roots. Second, two independent methods of measuring cell cycle phases, long-term live-cell imaging using fluorescent protein cell cycle markers and 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) pulse-chase imaging, showed that the length of G2 in root meristem cortex cells is shorter in sim mutant plants compared to WT, consistent with the view that these changes in G2 length are due to greater G2 CDK activity in sim mutants. Additionally, the fluorescence of a CYCB:GFP fusion both rose and declined more sharply in the mutant than in wild-type. Because both transcription and degradation of this fusion are directly affected by G2 CDK activity, this result is consistent with sim mutants having greater G2 CDK activity. Taken together, these results suggest that, in addition to its known role in inducing endoreplication, SIM may play a role in regulating the length of G2 during mitotic cycles, at least partially replacing the absence of WEE1/CDC25 regulation of the mitotic cell cycle.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

In maize, parthenogenesis was achieved by egg cell expression of the transcription factor ZmBABY BOOM 1 but a viable apomeiosis strategy has not been reported. In the MiMe (Mitosis instead of Meiosis) system, in addition to mutants that skip recombination and sister chromatid adhesion, mutation of genes involved in cell cycle control during meiosis is needed to skip the second division and ensure diploid gametes.

As distinct insect species can generate unique gall morphologies even on the same host plant, galls are often viewed as an extended phenotype of the insect. However, since galls consist of plant-derived cells, plant factors are also hypothesized to shape their morphology. Previous studies exploring this possibility have been restricted to one or a few plant species, limiting broad evolutionary inference. Here, we used citizen science observations to analyze gall morphological complexity across 26 plant orders. Quantitative comparisons using fractal dimension indices revealed that stem-derived galls display significantly less morphological variation than leaf-derived galls. Generalized linear mixed models indicated that stems possess lower morphological plasticity than leaves. These results held even after accounting for insect and plant phylogeny, suggesting that gall form is influenced by both insect species and the developmental properties of the host organ.

By systematically exposing cells to a range of light periodicities, we show that while cyclic EF has a large bandwidth, pseudo-cyclic EF (PCEF) can only sustain the cells energetic needs for fast light fluctuations, and that the interplay between the chloroplast and the mitochondria (CMEF) has a limited bandwidth. We further show that the bandwidths of PCEF and CMEF, specialized for dynamic lights, are related to their capacity to generate ATP and protect the photosynthetic apparatus. Finally, we show that in wild-type cells, the activity level of PCEF and CMEF matches their bandwidth, and we propose that cells tune the relative activity of each AEF depending on the light fluctuation frequency. Our work opens an avenue of research to characterize the molecular mechanisms required for phototrophic growth in complex and dynamic energetic landscapes. It further provides a generalizable framework for understanding the physiological importance of molecular mechanisms in a dynamic environment.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

In Arabidopsis, the RNA-binding protein RBP47b is a canonical SG marker, yet its functional contribution to thermotolerance remains unresolved. Here, we combined mTurboID proximity labeling with multi-omics profiling to define the RBP47b interactome and its physiological impact. mTurboID identified a stress-specific enrichment of 40S ribosomal subunits within RBP47b SGs, implicating these condensates in translational control. Surprisingly, quadruple mutant plants lacking all four RBP47 paralogues (rbp47abcc') displayed enhanced survival, attenuated growth delay, and faster recovery of photosynthetic efficiency after severe heat stress. Integrated transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome analyses revealed that this gain of thermotolerance is associated with (i) accelerated re-initiation of translation, (ii) constitutively elevated jasmonate and oxylipin pools, and (iii) reduced ROS accumulation during heat and recovery. We conclude that the RBP47 family acts as a negative regulator of heat tolerance by sequestering 40S subunits and limiting translational restart; loss of these SG scaffolds pre-primes jasmonate-dependent detoxification pathways and expedites proteome rebuilding, thereby conferring superior thermotolerance.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Here, we report on the physiological and proteomic responses of wild type and respiratory burst oxidase homolog 1 (rbo1) mutant cells of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to a MFSC of 5 different abiotic stresses. While several similarities were found between plant and C. reinhardtii responses to MFSC, our work revealed that MFSC induces aggregation in the unicellular organism C. reinhardtii. We further show that MFSC induced aggregation is enhanced in the rbo1 mutant and can be triggered by H2O2. As aggregation typically leads to reduced growth, respiration and/or photosynthesis, enhanced aggregation of unicellular organisms in different ecosystems subjected to MFSC could explain part of the negative impacts of MFSC on the services they provide. Our findings shed new light on the response of unicellular organisms to MFSC and suggest that one of the main drivers leading to multicellularity during evolution was early conditions of MFSC under an oxygenated environment.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Nonetheless, evolution has optimized reproductive efficiency across a diverse range of strategies. Animal vivipary, the process in which embryos develop inside the parent's body, allows for larger offspring and better protection. This reproductive strategy relies on a fertilization signal sent to the maternal tissues to establish an embryo-supportive environment, a process known as \"maternal recognition of pregnancy\". Despite being a strictly animal-only term, plants independently evolved a conceptually similar strategy: the seed habit, wherein the embryo is nourished and protected by surrounding maternal tissues. We discovered that sucrose is sufficient to trigger a fertilization-independent response in the maternal tissues of Arabidopsis ovules. Upon fertilization, the release of Polycomb-mediated repression promotes the symplastic and apoplastic flow of sucrose into the seed by modulating auxin and trehalose 6-phosphate signaling. The sucrose signal is then perceived by the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN kinase and transduced into a gibberellin response to initiate the differentiation of the seed maternal tissues. This work revealed a zygotic-maternal interplay of hormonal and sugar signaling that drives the plant \"maternal recognition of fertilization\", incorporating energetic cues into developmental pathways.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Preserving locomotive capacity was likely essential for survival during the human hunter-gatherer period but surprisingly little is known about the molecular effects of energy deficit on human skeletal muscle, which is a key tissue for locomotion and metabolic health. Here we show that a 5-day 78% reduction in energy availability with concomitant aerobic exercise in healthy men leads to a profound modulation of skeletal muscle phenotype alongside increases in fat oxidation at rest and during exercise and a 2.1 {+/-} 0.8 kg loss of fat free mass and 0.8 {+/-} 0.6 kg of fat mass. We used stable isotope (D2O) labelling and peptide mass spectrometry to investigate the abundance and turnover rates of individual proteins. Abundance (1469 proteins) and synthesis rate (736 proteins) data discovered a shift toward a more oxidative phenotype and reorganisation of cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix structure during energy deficit. Mitochondrial components: TCA, electron transport chain and beta-oxidation, were prominently represented amongst proteins that increased in abundance and synthesis rate, as well as proteins related to mitochondrial proteostasis, remodelling and quality-control such as BDH1 and LONP1. Changes in muscle metabolic pathways occurred alongside a reduction in extracellular matrix proteins, which may counteract the age-related muscle fibrosis. Our results suggest that muscle metabolic pathways are not only preserved but positively affected during periods of concomitant low energy availability and exercise.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERR) plays a critical role in adult skeletal muscle metabolism and exercise fitness. Whether ERR activation can drive muscle regeneration and mitigation of dystrophy in DMD is not known. We have investigated ERR signaling in pre-clinical models of acute muscle injury and DMD. ERR is induced in differentiating C2C12 myoblast and regenerating muscle. ERR silencing suppressed proliferation and differentiation in C2C12 myoblasts. RNA sequencing revealed that angiogenic factor and proliferation genes were downregulated by ERR knockdown in proliferating cells, whereas oxidative mitochondrial and differentiation regulator genes were downregulated in differentiating cells. In accordance with in vitro findings, transgenic ERR overexpression in rodent skeletal muscle stimulates muscle regeneration after acute BaCl2 injury, which is accompanied by enhanced angiogenesis and mitochondrial biogenesis. Notably, ERR and its angiogenic and metabolic target gene expression is suppressed in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) derived from dystrophic muscles in mdx mice, coinciding with proliferation and differentiation defect in these cells. Loss of ERR and its target gene expression was recapitulated in adult dystrophic mdx muscles. Consequently, muscle specific ERR overexpression in mdx mice restored angiogenic and metabolic gene expression, induced vascular and oxidative remodeling, alleviated baseline muscle damage, and boosted regeneration after BaCl2 injury in dystrophic muscle. Our studies demonstrate a pro-regenerative role of ERR and its deficiency in dystrophic muscles and its MuSCs.

Understanding physiological responses to a combined stress is of particular importance in face of the imminent global climate changes, which is predicted to entail not only higher temperatures, but also increase in drought, imposing restrictions to the productivity of economically important species as Eucalyptus globulus. This forest species is critically affected by changes in temperature and water availability, since its high productivity implies in high rates of water use. In order to evaluate the photosynthetic responses of E. globulus to these environmental conditions, young plants were grown at 25o C and 35o C under different irrigation regimes: full irrigation (FI), moderate drought (MD), and severe drought (SD). Plants grown at 25o C FI and MD were also subjected to a short-term exposure to 35o C. Several ecophysiological variables, derived mainly from leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements, were compared in order to test the hypotheses that: i) E. globulus show different responses to short or long-term exposure to 35o C; ii) the effect of both stresses combined will not be simply the sum of each condition applied separately. Our results showed that plants respond differently to water deficit according to the thermal regime. The combination of water deficit and a long-term exposure to 35o C caused a down-acclimation of the photosynthetic capacity, while plants under the short-term treatment showed a higher performance, even when compared to the 25o C control condition, supporting the hypothesis i. Thus, the short-term exposure to 35o C induced an increase in tolerance to water deficit. Since the response to a combination of heat and drought differed from the superposition of individual responses, as observed mainly at 35o C, the hypothesis ii was also supported by our results.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Such comparisons may be useful for pinpointing precisely the codon sites that are under differing selective pressures due to differing environmental contexts, or differing genomic contexts via epistatic interactions. Indeed, this was only recently addressed by an approach, developed in the frequentist framework, that proposes a site-wise likelihood ratio hypothesis test. Previously, we have demonstrated that approximate grid-based Bayesian approaches to characterizing site-wise variation in selection parameters can outperform individual site-wise likelihood ratio tests. Such grid-based approaches can exhibit poor computational scaling when the number of site-wise parameters expands, but here we show that this is still tractable up to four parameters, and that a simple subtree-likelihood caching strategy can provide efficiency improvements in some cases. We propose difFUBAR, which allows the demarcation of two branch sets of interest and, optionally, a background set, and estimates joint site-specific posterior distributions over , {omega}1, {omega}2, and {omega}BG using a Gibbs sampler. Evidence for hypotheses of interest can then be quantified directly from the posterior distribution, and we standardly report P({omega}1>{omega}2), P({omega}2>{omega}1), P({omega}1>1), and P({omega}2>1). We characterize the computational and statistical performance of this approach on previous simulations, comparing it to a site-wise likelihood ratio test approach, where it shows moderate statistical benefits, and substantial computational gains, typically being more than two orders of magnitude faster on the same datasets.

We tested different mathematical models on a first cohort (patients) (Cote d'Or Registry) to determine the onset and evolution times before JAK2V617F classical myeloproliferative disorders (polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia) are diagnosed. We considered the time to diagnosis as the sum of two periods: the time (from embryonic development) for the JAK2V617F mutation to appear, not disappear and enter proliferation, and a second period corresponding to the expansion of the clonal population until diagnosis. Using increasingly complex models, we show that the rate of active mutation cannot be constant, but rather increases exponentially with age, following the well-known Gompertz model. We found that it takes an average of 63.1 +/- 13 years for the first tumor cell to appear and start proliferating. On the other hand, the expansion time is constant: 8.8 years once the mutation has occurred. These results were validated in an external cohort (national FIMBANK cohort). Using this model, we analyzed JAK2V167F Essential Thrombocythemia versus Polycythemia Vera and found that the time to active mutation in PV is about 1.5 years longer than in ET, while the expansion time is similar. In conclusion, our multi-step approach and the final age-dependent model for the onset and development of MPN shows that the onset of a JAKV617F mutation should be linked to an ageing mechanism and indicates a period of 8-9 years for the development of a full MPN.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

A.; Yin, L.; Albanesi, D.; Zheng, J.; De Mendoza, D.; Garner, E.", "abstract": "The first step of cell division is deforming the planar cell membrane inward towards the cytoplasm. As deforming membranes is energetically costly, biology has developed various protein systems to accomplish this task. The mechanisms providing the force to deform bacterial membranes to initiate division remain unknown. In vivo studies have shown the condensation of FtsZ filaments into a sharp ring is required to initiate cell division, an observation mirrored in vitro with FtsZ filaments encapsulated inside liposomes. Similarly, the force for membrane deformation in many eukaryotic deforming systems arises from the local crowding of proteins on the membrane surface. As any membrane deforming system works against the membrane tension, here we modulated the amount of lipid synthesis and thus membrane tension in Bacillus subtilis to examine: 1) if the condensation of FtsZ filaments by FtsZ bundling proteins serves to overcome the cellular membrane tension to deform the membrane inward and 2) how changes to the membrane tension affect the subsequent invagination of the septum. First, we developed methods to simultaneously measure and modulate membrane tension in live cells. Next, we determined how altering the membrane tension affected the cells ability to initiate division with reduced levels of FtsZ bundling proteins. While cells depleted of 2 FtsZ bundling proteins were unable to divide, reducing membrane tension to a given threshold restored their ability to initiate division. Likewise, cells with intermediate levels of FtsZ bundling proteins required a lesser decrease in membrane tension to initiate division. We also found that reductions in membrane tension increase the rate of Z ring constriction, with the constriction rate scaling linearly with the membrane tension. Interestingly, while the constriction rate in wild-type B. subtilis is limited by FtsZ treadmilling, the rate of constriction becomes independent of FtsZs treadmilling rate when membrane tension is reduced. These experiments give two major insights: First, the filament condensation caused by FtsZ bundling proteins works to overcome membrane tension and deform the membrane inward to initiate division. Second, the rate of septal constriction is limited by membrane tension, suggesting that membrane fluctuations at the tip of the growing septa limit the rate of cell wall synthesis. Finally, our measurements allow the estimation of several physical values of cell division, such as the force required to bend the membrane, but also that the cell membrane provides only 0.1%, a small amount of surface tension relative to the entire cell envelope, indicating 99.9% of the pressure drop occurs across the cell wall. These calculations also indicate that cell division occurs via comparatively very small membrane tension fluctuations relative to the high turgor pressure that exists across the entire cell envelope.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

This study addresses these challenges with respect to differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells to kidney organoids. Based on a factorial single-cell transcriptomic analysis across a 27-day differentiation protocol, including 150,957 cells collected at five time points, we present a comprehensive classification of predicted identity, representing an in vitro temporal transcriptional atlas. For early stages, cellular identity was defined in relation to existing human developmental data across time and organ system. As renal structures arose, this was coupled with the kidney-specific classification methods. In this way we identify predicted cellular states, predictable off-target cell types based on embryology and transitional mesodermal populations with no clear in vivo equivalent. An analysis of all existing single cell data on this same protocol suggests the presence of the same off-target trajectories irrespective of cell line or laboratory.

While the response of leaf functional traits to these global change factors have been widely studied, reproductive traits remain relatively understudied, despite their key role in the diversification and distribution of flowering plants. Here, we investigated how elevated CO2, warming, drought, and their interactions affect floral, leaf and seed traits in two model grassland species. We also examined how these factors influence trait coordination. Methods: Two perennial herbs, Lotus corniculatus and Crepis capillaris, were sampled from a 10-year climate manipulation experiment. We measured resource economic traits related to organ size, construction cost, and dry matter content in both leaves and flowers, along with seed size and number. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess trait responses, and rank-abundance curves were employed to visualize changes in trait coordination across treatments. Key Results: Floral traits, like leaf traits, exhibit trade-offs among themselves but are largely independent of leaf traits. Trait responses to global change factors were inconsistent across species, with drought being the dominant factor affecting only leaf traits in L. corniculatus and all organ types in C. capillaris. Extreme global change conditions led to stronger trait coordination in L. corniculatus, while C. capillaris showed less coordination. Conclusion: Our results show that floral economic traits, like leaf traits, are responsive to individual and combined effects of global change factors. This highlights their importance in shaping plant strategies under environmental stress and emphasizes the need to better integrate floral traits into the whole-plant economic framework.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

These loops can span hundreds of thousands base pairs, making it challenging to link regulatory elements to the correct target genes using conventional proximity-based annotation methods. Using a novel tool to facilitate the exploration of complex gene regulatory networks based on chromosome configuration data in early lymphocytes, we show that lineage-specific transcription factors target regulatory elements that are annotated to both lineage-specific and broadly expressed genes. Targeted inactivation of a set of these genes revealed their importance for B-cell development. Several regulatory elements annotated to lineage-specific genes were also annotated to alternative promoters in a context dependent manner, revealing a highly complex interplay between promoters and DREs in early lymphocyte development. Investigating the chromatin configuration in EBF1 deficient pro-B cells identified this transcription factor as a key mediator in the establishment of the 3-D promoter enhancer landscape in early B-lymphocyte differentiation.

Such recombination arrest is thought to trigger sex chromosome divergence and degeneration and has evolved multiple times in homomorphic ancestors, making it a striking case of convergent evolution. Existing models for the evolution of recombination suppression fall into two main categories: those that rely on the prior segregation of sexually-antagonistic alleles and those that do not. Using mathematical modelling, we compare here the tempo of recombination evolution via the fixation of neutral recombination suppressors with those capturing a locus contributing to a sexually antagonistic trait. We do this for a trait locus with fixed effects and for a locus where allelic effects evolve. We show that sexual antagonism significantly accelerates the substitution of recombination modifiers relative to genetic drift alone, though the strength of this effect depends on the nature of sexually antagonistic variation and on the mating system. Where allelic values at the trait locus evolve, sexually antagonistic selection leads to a pattern of male heterozygote advantage that results in especially rapid substitution by recombination modifiers. We also find that recombination suppression driven by sexual antagonism often arises on the homogametic chromosome, which is not the case when suppression evolves solely due to drift. This pattern is especially strong in XY systems where male reproductive success is highly variable. Our results highlight sexual antagonism as a key driver of recombination arrest, and suggest that reproductive ecology may play a previously underappreciated role in the evolution and stability of sex chromosome systems.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Mice latently infected with murine CMV (MCMV) were orthotopically implanted with pancreatic cancer cells and treated with systemic injections of MCMV T-cell epitopes. The therapy promoted preferential accumulation of MCMV-specific T cells within pancreatic tumors, delaying tumor growth and increasing survival. Immunophenotyping and scRNAseq analyses showed these T cells were highly activated and cytotoxic, leading to increased tumor necrosis and caspase-3 activation. Finally, therapy was enhanced when combined with subtherapeutic doses of gemcitabine chemotherapy. Together, these results show that CMV-specific T cells can be repurposed to combat pancreatic cancer.

However, despite dozens of tools to identify signatures in cancer samples, there is not an established metric for statistically comparing mutational signature results and quantifying the overall significance of differences among complex mixtures of signatures. To close this methodological gap, we demonstrate that a signature-agnostic metric for measuring differences in mutation spectra - the aggregate mutation spectrum distance permutation method (AMSD) - can discover differences overlooked by signature analysis. First, we reanalyzed a study of carcinogen exposure in mice, identifying statistically significant shifts in mutation spectra caused by eleven of twenty tested carcinogens. Only three carcinogens were previously reported to induce distinct mutation signatures, suggesting that many carcinogens perturb mutagenesis by altering the composition of endogenous signatures rather than introducing unique signatures. Next, we used human tumor data to determine whether patient ancestry has a measurable impact on tumor mutation spectra, finding significant ancestry-associated differences across ten cancer types: for example, Africans have elevated SBS4 in lung adenocarcinomas, East Asians have elevated SBS16 in esophageal and liver cancers plus elevated SBS10a/b in uterine and colorectal cancers, and Europeans have elevated SBS17b in esophageal cancers plus elevated SBS2/13 in bladder cancers. These examples suggest that AMSD is a robust tool for detecting differences among tumor mutation spectra, complementing signature-based approaches and enabling the discovery of environmental and genetic influences on mutagenesis in large datasets.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

We found that EC d4 exhibited a pronounced Dox hypersensitivity as compared to both mESC and EC d6, which was independent of drug transport. Analysis of EdU incorporation and replication fork progression following drug treatment revealed substantial agent-specific differences between mESC and the various differentiation stages. Furthermore, cellular susceptibility to drug-induced formation of DNA damage (i.e. DSB and SSB) also changes with ongoing differentiation and drug treatment, with mESC and EC d4 / EC d6 being particular prone to enhanced residual SSB and DSB levels, respectively. Dox treatment of EC d4 did not affect their differentiation into EC d6, but caused multiple functional impairments of the surviving EC d6 progeny, including defects in mitochondrial homeostasis, barrier function related to cell-cell adhesion factors ZO1 and VE-cadherin, response to cytokine stimulation as well as LDL uptake. To summarize, we show substantial differences in the response of mESC, EC d4 and EC d6 to Dox and pharmacological inhibitors of DNA repair and DDR. Most important, treatment of EC d4 results in pronounced persisting functional impairments of differentiated EC d6, pointing to a transient particularly drug-sensitive time window during endothelial differentiation.

In this study, we explore mitochondrial fission and fusion dynamics through the framework of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, a hallmark of non-equilibrium system that exhibits periodic changes in reactant concentrations through autocatalysis and feedback regulation. We observed that mitochondrial changes followed an oscillatory dynamic where the fission, fusion and intermediary factors undergo oscillations. Also, by modelling comparison with publicly available datasets of diseased condition before and after therapy, we observed similarities, where under diseased condition there is increased concentration of the fission and fusion factors but upon treatment the concentration of the intermediary factors increase. Also, patient survival data analysis showed that increase in fission and fusion factors correlated with increased deaths but when there is increase in the intermediary factor concentration, we see better patient survival. These results highlight the possibility of targeting mitochondrial dynamics as a potential strategy for therapeutic development for diseases such as cancer where mitochondrial dynamics is dysregulated.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Maps of the structural dimorphisms in these circuits have been explored by analyzing synaptic connectomes, electron micrograph reconstructions of synaptic connectivity. Nevertheless, recent studies in the model organism C. elegans have shown little to no correlation between the synaptic connectome and dynamic neural activity. Therefore, the extent of sexual dimorphism in functional neural activity remains unknown. To determine the extent of functional sexual-dimorphisms in C. elegans we compared activity, neuron-by-neuron, across all neurons in the heads of both sexes. To sample a broad view of responses to different sensory modalities, we tested a diverse panel of ethologically-relevant olfactory, gustatory, and chemical stimuli, representing both attractive and aversive cues. We found that nearly every sensory neuron responded dimorphically to at least one cue and monomorphically to other cues, indicating that sexually-dimorphic circuits are pervasive and stimulus dependent. This dimorphic and monomorphic activity was present to a lesser extent in downstream interneurons and even less so in motoneurons, implicating sensory neurons as the primary source and location of sexually-dimorphic activity. Comparing the functional activity we measured to the published synaptic connectomes of both sexes revealed that sexual dimorphism in functional connectivity was distinct from and complementary to sexual dimorphism in synaptic connectivity.

The connection between DNA damage and neurodegeneration is extensively investigated, however, the mechanisms limiting the propagation of damaged DNA from highly replicative neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) to post-mitotic neurons remains largely unknown. Here, we describe that enzymatic activity of the histone deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) is important for the homologues recombination-dependent repair of double-stranded DNA breaks induced by etoposide. Furthemore, SIRT1 abolishes neuronal fate of murine NSPCs following induction of DNA damage. Pharmacological inhibition or genetic inactivation of SIRT1 rescues etoposide-mediated inhibition of neuronal differentiation in NSPCs and hippocampal slice cultures and promotes transcription of pro-neuronal genes. Inhibition of Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), the central regulator of the DNA damage response, mimics the SIRT-dependent effect of DNA damage on neuronal differentiation, indicating that the ATM/SIRT1 axis inhibits formation of neuronal cells harbouring damaged DNA.

E.; Lander, A.; Calof, A.", "abstract": "Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are frequently observed in the most common form of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), which is caused by haploinsufficiency for NIPBL, a gene involved in chromatin looping and cis-regulatory control of gene expression. Here, we surveyed cardiac defects in mice made Nipbl-haploinsufficient in the second heart field using two Cre drivers: Mef2c-Cre and Isl1-Cre. Only Isl1-Cre-driven Nipbl-haploinsufficiency resulted in CHDs - a finding we traced to the additional contribution of Isl1-haploinsufficiency caused by the Isl1-Cre allele. To test whether combined reduction of Nipbl and Isl1 cause CHDs, we made mice globally haploinsufficient for both genes. Indeed, Nipbl+/-; Isl1+/- mice exhibited a substantially higher frequency and severity of CHDs than mice haploinsufficient for either gene alone. As a member of the LIM-homeodomain transcription factor family, Isl1 is involved in chromatin looping and enhancer-promoter communication via a mechanism distinct from that of Nipbl. Nevertheless, when we performed RNA sequencing on E10.5 hearts from wildtype, Nipbl+/-, Isl1+/-, and Nipbl+/-; Isl1+/- embryos, we observed that combined haploinsufficiency resulted in largely additive gene expression changes, including dysregulation of known cardiac regulators (Irx4, Tbx1, Foxo6, Heyl, Bnc1, Sox17) and novel candidates (Gbx1, Csdc2, Myrf, Pou6f1, Zfp579, ad Zfp763). A subset of additive changes arose from opposing regulatory influences in single mutants that restored gene expression to WT levels in Nipbl/-; Isl1/- hearts. For example, Hoxc4, Pitx2, Isl1 itself, and Pax6 (a known target of Isl1), were upregulated in Nipbl+/- hearts, downregulated in Isl1+/- hearts, but expressed at WT levels in Nipbl/-; Isl1/- hearts. Since loss of Isl1 upregulation from Nipbl+/- to Nipbl+/-; Isl1+/- hearts coincided with a marked increase in CHDs, we propose that Isl1 upregulation compensates for the loss of cis-regulatory interactions due to Nipbl-haploinsufficiency, and protects hearts from severe CHD risk. Supporting this model, other LIM-homeodomain transcription factors (Lhx2, Lhx3, Lhx9) were also upregulated in Nipbl+/- hearts, with Lhx3 and Lhx9 showing even greater upregulation in Nipbl+/-; Isl1+/- hearts. Despite this, CHDs resulting from the combined loss of Nipbl and Isl1 were particularly severe. These findings suggest that heart development is exquisitely sensitive to small change in gene expression, leading to synergistic phenotypic interactions when relatively modest gene expression changes are combined.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

To this end, statistical inference from extant cophylogenetic systems holds immense potential. However, such inference cannot yet handle the speciation-extinction dynamics that occur simultaneously in the host and symbiont clades on the same timescale. Here we present an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approach that, while taking into account host and symbiont extinction, infers rates of four types of speciation from a cophylogenetic system: (i) host speciation, (ii) symbiont speciation without host-switching, (iii) symbiont speciation with host-switching, and (iv) cospeciation. The new ABC approach relies on a novel design of summary statistics combining both size-based (i.e., tree sizes) and size-free summary statistics (i.e., the normalized distribution of Branch Length Differences - BLenD) of the cophylogeny. Convergence analyses show that the combined design of summary statistics outperforms size-based or size-free summary statistics alone - achieving satisfactory accuracy in detecting rate heterogeneity between the four types of speciation. Our ABC approach allows the user to infer the predominant mode of speciation within a given cophylogenetic system. The approach is demonstrated with an application to a cophylogenetic dataset of commensalism, in which beetles of one genus mimic those of another. In this system, we identify host speciation as the predominant process with the fastest rate (in events per unit time) among all four types of speciation (i.e., 4.3-5.1 times faster than the median among all four types of speciation). Understanding how and why different types of speciation may predominate in different cophylogenetic systems can have implications for various areas in ecology and evolution such as host conservatism, trait-driven diversification, pathogen spillover risk, and parasite extinction risk. This new approach highlights the need and potential for future efforts to compile time-calibrated cophylogenies.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

One intriguing aspect of genome integrity is the formation and function of neocentromeres at non-centromeric sites. CENP-A, a centromere-specific protein, is essential for centromere identification and function. However, in many cancers, CENP-A is often found to be ectopically misplaced when overexpressed. Moreover, CENP-A deposition at the centromere depends on the transcription of centromeric non-coding RNAs. Consequently, ectopic CENP-A is found at transcriptionally active and frequent breakpoint regions. To further explore ectopic CENP-A localization, we previously engineered a stable ectopic CENP-A site on a naive chromosome by overexpressing a non-centromeric oncogenic lncRNA, PCAT2, which was capable of recruiting CENP-A to its transcription site. In this work, we tracked cells carrying this stable transgene to understand the longevity of the induced ectopic CENP-A site at the chromosome that harbors it. Our findings revealed that the induced epigenetic memory was eventually lost due to the suppression of the transgene through competing epigenetic silencing mechanisms. This epigenetic restoration naturally reversed the ectopic CENP-A level to its previous levels at the engineered site. These data suggest that cells may have evolved failsafe mechanisms to prevent neocentromere formation at ectopic sites by suppressing transcription, unless otherwise favored by selection involving multiple components.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Mutations in TIMP-3 cause Sorsby fundus dystrophy, an inherited macular dystrophy that is similar to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but which generally presents earlier. SFD is characterised by the accumulation of mutant TIMP-3 protein in Bruch's membrane, a multilamellar extracellular matrix underlying the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Here, we show that RPE cells regulate wild-type TIMP-3 levels post-translationally, with ARPE-19 and hTERT RPE-1 cells endocytosing the protein via the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) family of scavenger receptors. LRP-mediated endocytosis of the SFD TIMP-3 variants S204C and Y191C was significantly delayed, establishing a molecular mechanism for their extracellular accumulation in SFD. In contrast, endocytosis of the SFD variant H181R TIMP-3 was unaltered, suggesting it accumulates through a distinct molecular mechanism, potentially via increased retention on extracellular matrix heparan sulfate proteoglycans. These findings reveal heterogeneity in the molecular mechanism of SFD pathogenesis, which has direct implications for therapeutic development. Genotype-specific interventions may be required, such as strategies to enhance receptor-mediated clearance or disrupt extracellular TIMP-3 retention. Our study also has broader implications for AMD, where TIMP-3 and other LRP and heparan sulfate ligands accumulate in drusen within Bruch's membrane.

We observed, by using constitutive and conditional P2X4mCherryIN knock-in adult mouse models, a specific high expression of mCherry-tagged P2X4 in living cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs), from immature postnatal stages to adulthood. This P2X4-mCherry expression, confirmed by immuno-confocal fluorescence microscopy in wild-type mice, was mainly concentrated in the intracellular apical region of the OHCs, in the area of the Hensen's body, a lysosomal rich region, specifically labeled with the fluorescent dye lysotracker.

Surprisingly, the assessment of the hearing function in constitutive P2X4 knock-out (P2X4KO) mice showed improved auditory brainstem responses with smaller latencies, larger amplitudes and smaller thresholds. These P2X4KO mice, as well as conditional P2X4KO-Myo15-Cre mice, displayed enhanced distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), suggesting an improved electromechanical amplification activity by OHCs.

This assay identified several proteins including the TPX2 homologue Mei-38 that localise more strongly to microtubules near the chromosomes than away from them. We identified a microtubule-binding domain containing a region highly conserved also in humans. The domain itself is regulated spatially, and contains a conserved serine and a nearby PP2A-B56 docking motif. A non-phosphorylatable mutation of this serine allows the domain to localise to ectopic microtubules as well as spindle microtubules, while mutations in a PP2A-B56 docking motif greatly reduced the spindle localisation.

The limited ability of adult cardiomyocytes to re-enter the cell cycle is a major cause of cardiac injury-induced morbidity and mortality. Here, we report that post-prandial Burmese python cardiomyocytes activate cell cycle re-entry to promote persistent cardiac growth. Burmese pythons normally eat large meals infrequently, resulting in reversible cardiac hypertrophy. We found that frequent feeding of large meals amplifies the modest post-prandial cardiac proliferation identified in an infrequent feeding interval. By activating E2F and Forkhead Box M1 (FoxM1) pro-proliferation transcriptional networks, frequently fed Burmese pythons initiate cardiomyocyte hyperplasia. These findings identify hyperplasia as a natural means of sustained cardiac growth in Burmese pythons and support the use of pythons as a new model for investigating proliferative cardiac remodeling.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

The bacteria releases effector proteins some of which remodel the host autophagic-lysosomal pathways. One effector is RavZ, which delipidates ATG8 proteins, making Legionella-infected cells deficient in autophagy. Here we show that SidE effectors mediate the phosphoribosyl ubiquitination (PR-Ub) of autophagic SNARE proteins STX17 and SNAP29. STX17 modification induces recruitment of STX17+ membranes from the endoplasmic reticulum to Legionella-containing phagosomes to form replicative vacuoles. Using proximity labeling, biochemistry and Legionella infection studies, we have discovered a mechanism by which autophagy is hijacked by bacteria to recruit ER membranes to the bacterial vacuole which has autophagy markers but do not fuse with lysosomes. Mass spectrometric identification of PR-Ub sites and mutational studies show that PR-Ub modification of STX17 alters its interaction with ATG14L, which drives the recruitment of ER membranes to the bacterial vacuole in a PI3K dependent manner. On the other hand, PR-Ub of SNAP29 inhibits the formation of the autophagosomal SNARE complex (STX17-SNAP29-VAMP8) by steric hindrance, thereby preventing the fusion of bacterial vacuoles with lysosomes.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Theories of predictive processing propose that sensory systems constantly predict incoming signals, based on spatial and temporal context. However, evidence for prediction in sensory cortex largely comes from artificial experiments using simple, highly predictable stimuli, that arguably encourage prediction. Here, we test for sensory prediction during natural scene perception. Specifically, we use deep generative modelling to quantify the spatial predictability of receptive field (RF) patches in natural images, and compared those predictability estimates to brain responses in the mouse visual cortex - while rigorously accounting for established tuning to a rich set of low-level image features and their local statistical context - in a large scale survey of high-density recordings from the Allen Institute Brain Observatory. This revealed four insights. First, cortical responses across the mouse visual system are shaped by sensory predictability, with more predictable image patches evoking weaker responses. Secondly, visual cortical neurons are primarily sensitive to the predictability of higher-level image features, even in neurons in the primary visual areas that are preferentially tuned to low-level visual features. Third, unpredictability sensitivity is stronger in the superficial layers of primary visual cortex, in line with predictive coding models. Finally, these spatial prediction effects are independent of recent experience, suggesting that they rely on long-term priors about the structure of the visual world. Together, these results suggest visual cortex might predominantly predict sensory information at higher levels of abstraction - a pattern bearing striking similarities to recent, successful techniques from artificial intelligence for predictive self-supervised learning.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

How differentiation and transdifferentiation are regulated at the molecular level is not well understood. Here, we show that inducible degradation of the Friend of GATA (FOG) homolog U-shaped (Ush) in the plasmatocyte-like S2 cell line results in downregulation of plasmatocyte marker genes and subsequent upregulation of lamellocyte marker genes. This transcriptional shift is accompanied by morphological and functional changes consistent with lamellocyte cell identity, including increased cell spreading and adhesion, driven by enhanced integrin expression associated with increased focal adhesions.

FMRI captures brain functional activity while dMRI reveals structural connectivity via white matter bundles, each of which provide unique yet complementary insights; however combing these two modalities, particularly at a dynamic level, is challenging due to their drastically different data characteristics. This study introduces a novel framework named \"dynamic fusion,\" which extends joint component analysis (cmICA) to integrate static structural connectivity (SC) with dynamic functional connectivity (FC). Our approach gauges the relationship between these joint components across various temporal states, aiming to discover both static and dynamic features of brain connectivity. We applied this approach to fMRI and dMRI data from the same set of control subjects, which we had previously studied to estimate joint parcellation and their structural and functional connections using a static model only, and also included a comparable number of individuals with schizophrenia from the same study. Our results reveal that dynamic fusion not only highlights diverse temporal dynamics in FC but, more importantly, also shows how SC patterns differ across dynamic functional states at different time frames, providing new insights into brain organization. Furthermore, it successfully detects joint structural-functional connectivity differences between individuals with schizophrenia and controls, demonstrating its potential for detecting hidden group differences. Overall, this study establishes our dynamic fusion as a powerful tool for integrating structural and dynamic functional connectivity data, enhancing our understanding of brain connectivity and offering new perspectives for studying neurological disorders.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

We compared the pulmonary immune response to CLP in \"Immune-Educated\" mice (treated with anti-CD3{varepsilon} activating antibody to induce T cell memory) to Uneducated controls. Compared to Uneducated mice, 24 hours after CLP, Immune-Educated mice had higher alveolar inflammatory cytokine and chemokine concentrations and more pulmonary interstitial macrophages. After 48 hours, the proportion of effector CD4 T cells that produced interferon-gamma was greater in Immune-Educated mice. After 72 hours, there were more alveolar macrophages in the lungs of Educated mice. Separately, we performed adoptive transfer of memory CD4 and CD8 T cells from immunized C57Bl/6J to B6.SJL mice and IFN{gamma} blockade at the time of CLP. Interstitial macrophage recruitment 24 hours post-CLP was more pronounced in mice undergoing adoptive transfer of memory T cells compared to mice that did not undergo adoptive transfer. IFN{gamma} blockade resulted in higher absolute numbers of T cells, memory T cells, and innate cells in the lungs of Educated mice 24 hours post-CLP suggesting that IFN{gamma} is necessary for curbing an overactive immune response in these mice. In conclusion, the presence of memory T cells affects the course of CLP-induced lung inflammation and may provide a model that more closely resembles sepsis-associated lung injury.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Hfq is an RNA-chaperone conserved in many bacteria that undergoes condensation in response to diverse stresses. Using nitrogen (N) starvation in Escherichia coli as a model stress condition, we show that Hfq condensation occurs independently of any extracellular cues, cytoplasmic shrinkage that cells undergo during N starvation or the canonical NtrBC-dependent adaptive response to N starvation. However, we demonstrate that Hfq condensation is coupled to the inhibition of carbon assimilation in N-starved E. coli. Further, by comparing the transcriptomes of wild-type bacteria and bacteria unable to form Hfq-condensates, we reveal that Hfq-condensates contribute to the stabilisation of Hfq-associated non-coding regulatory RNAs.

We previously provided evidence that loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 triggered by influenza A virus (IAV) infection promotes activation of host antiviral immunity via a mechanism involving derepression of EREs and production of immunostimulatory RNAs. While the IAV NS1 protein might limit consequences of such activation via its dsRNA-binding activity, we hypothesized that other human pathogenic viruses could have evolved more direct strategies to counteract this potential ERE-based defense system. Here, we reveal that V proteins from diverse paramyxoviruses, including Measles, Mumps, Parainfluenza, and Nipah/Hendra viruses, can all engage with TRIM28. Notably, the efficiency of engagement varies markedly between virus species, a phenotype that can be linked to specific residues within the C-terminal domain of V proteins. Further mapping showed that V proteins target both the TRIM28 Coiled-Coil domain and the TRIM28 PHD-Bromodomain, which contains the functionally-relevant TRIM28 SUMO-modification sites necessary for ERE repression. In this context, while paramyxovirus infection triggers canonical stress-associated phosphorylation of TRIM28, loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 does not occur, and minimal induction of the TRIM28-dependent ERE RNA, HERVK14C, is observed. Furthermore, pre-infection with Parainfluenza virus type 2, which encodes a V protein that efficiently engages with TRIM28, limits subsequent IAV-triggered loss of SUMO-modified TRIM28 and upregulation of HERVK14C RNA.

Nisin Z also showed promising activity against various cancer types in vitro, and significantly reduced tumor size in an ectopic head and neck cancer model. Here, we investigate the activity of nisin Z for colorectal cancer treatment and observed an in vitro reduction in cellular proliferation, and a moderate enhancement in cell death. We next analyzed the effect of oral nisin Z administration in the Apcmin/+ intestinal adenoma mouse model. We measured tumor burden along the gastrointestinal tract and observed a decrease in tumor burden in the middle region of the small intestine, but not in the lower region or colon. Since tumor progression in the Apcmin/+ model is exacerbated by an inflammatory environment, we next determined whether nisin Z impacts this in a direct or indirect manner. We show that nisin Z can directly reduce NF-kB activation in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, nisin Z impacted the cecal microbiome composition as well as microbiota-associated plasma metabolites, causing an overall shift towards a more health-associated profile. Interestingly, the Apcmin/+ genotype differentially impacted the nisin Z-mediated differences in cecal microbiome composition and plasma metabolites compared to wildtype animals. In summary, our data suggest that the reduction in small intestinal tumor burden could be due to nisin Z's contribution to a reduced pro-inflammatory environment. Future studies will reveal whether nisin's localized effect is due to degradation of the peptidic compound in more distal regions of the gastrointestinal tract and focus on development of delivery systems to increase efficacy.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Here we show that IAV infection at temperatures that simulate fever leads to increased mvRNA synthesis and antiviral signaling. Mathematical modeling and experimental analyses reveal that differential IAV nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase production underlies the increased mvRNA level. Moreover, at the higher infection temperature mvRNAs with dysregulating t-loops contribute most to the innate immune activation. We propose that fever during IAV infection can establish a positive feedback loop in which elevated aberrant RNA synthesis and innate immune activation may contribute to the dysregulation of cytokine production.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Each capsomer contains a central pore lined with rings of positively charged amino acid side chains - Arg-18 (R18) and Lys-25 (K25). The R18 and K25 rings drive capsid assembly by binding the host polyanion inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) and are proposed to mediate the import of dNTPs into the capsid to facilitate reverse transcription. Here we demonstrate that the R18 ring can be functionally replaced by the introduction of a mutation (N21K) that establishes a new electropositive ring within the central pore. In contrast with previous studies in which R18 mutants were unable to adapt in culture, the N21K mutation facilitated the acquisition of second-site compensatory mutations that restored near-WT fitness to viral mutants lacking the R18 ring. Comparative analysis of several central pore mutants lacking the R18 ring revealed that particle infectivity was not correlated with IP6 binding or capsid assembly, but rather with capsid stability and key post-entry events including reverse transcription and nuclear entry. Our results indicate that the central pore plays critical roles in both the assembly of capsids and their sustained stability post-entry.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Previous studies have shown that trade-offs among different resource utilization functions that cells cannot utilize broad types of substrates at near-maximum speed are crucial for the emergence of diverse strategies. However, in natural settings, nutrient availability often fluctuates over time, imposing additional trade-offs on cells. Cells that grow rapidly under nutrient-rich conditions will suffer a higher death rate under nutrient-poor conditions, creating a growth-death trade-off that intersects with the classical resource-use trade-off. Here, we introduce a unified mathematical model that simultaneously incorporates the resource-use trade-off and the growth-death trade-off. The nutrient supply was modeled as discrete stochastic events, capturing realistic temporal fluctuations. We show that the relative balance between growth and death rates critically influences the dominance of either generalist or specialist strategies. Specifically, under conditions of high average growth rates among different environments and a weak trade-off between growth and death rates, generalists prevail. In contrast, when the growth-death trade-off is intense, specialists emerge as the dominant strategy.

We also found that mainland An. gambiae populations had higher within-population genetic diversity than the islands', while An. arabiensis had the lowest nucleotide diversity.

Inadequate levels of B12 impair FOCM, depressing de novo thymidylate (dTMP) synthesis, which in turn leads to uracil accumulation in DNA. This phenomenon has been well documented in nuclear DNA. Our previous work in liver tissue has shown that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is more sensitive to FOCM impairments in that mtDNA exhibits elevated uracil levels before uracil concentrations in nuclear DNA change. However, the functional consequences of uracil accumulation in mtDNA are largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine how a functional B12 deficiency (induced by reduced levels of the B12-dependent enzyme methionine synthase (MTR)) and dietary B12 deficiency affects mtDNA integrity and mitochondrial function in energetic and mitochondria-rich tissues such as skeletal muscle. Methods: Male Mtr+/+ and Mtr+/- mice were weaned to either an AIN93G-based control (C) diet containing 25 /kg vitamin B12 or a B12-deficient (-B12) diet containing 0 /kg vitamin B12 to explore the effects of functional (Mtr+/-) and dietary B12 deficiency on muscle weight, uracil content in mtDNA, mtDNA content, and oxidative phosphorylation complex capacity in skeletal muscle. Aged (20-22mo) male C57BL6/N mice were acclimated to an AIN93G control diet four weeks, then received either weekly injections of saline (vehicle control [30 uL 0.9% NaCl]) or B12 (0.65mg per 30uL 0.9% NaCl) in each of two hindleg muscles [1.25 mg B12 total]) for 8 weeks. Results: The tibialis anterior (TA) muscle from Mtr+/- mice exhibited lowered maximal respiratory capacity of complex I, II, and IV of the electron transport chain than did TA from Mtr+/+ mice. Exposure to the -B12 diet lowered maximal capacity of complex I in red, mitochondrially rich muscle (soleus and mitochondria-rich portions of quadriceps and gastrocnemius) (p=0.02). Levels of uracil accumulation in mtDNA in red muscle and gastrocnemius were elevated ~10 fold with exposure to -B12 diet (p=0.04 and p<0.001, respectively). In aged mice gastrocnemius complex IV activity increased with intramuscular B12 supplementation (p=0.04). Conclusions: Exposure to a B12-deficient diet led to uracil accumulation in mtDNA and impaired maximal oxidative capacity in two different types of skeletal muscle.

Nowadays, Artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved significant progress has been made in medical image analysis across various applications. However, the main challenge hindering the widespread adoption of deep neural models in clinical settings is their lack of interpretability. In response to this need, we propose an enhanced CAD model with four key components: image pre-processing, feature extraction, feature dimensionality reduction, and classification. Utilizing the G1020 and ORIGA datasets, we employ a fast discrete curvelet transform with wrapping (FDCT-WRP) for curve-like feature extraction. A combined feature reduction technique, principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), is applied to generate relevant features and reduce the feature dimensionality. Incorporating an improved grey wolf Optimization (IMGWO) with an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification. Then, IMGWO optimizes parameters, enhancing the efficiency of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks. Through a 10 x 5- fold stratified cross-validation (SCV) test on standard datasets, our CAD model demonstrates superior performance. The proposed CAD model achieved better classification result i.e., 93.87% and 95.38% on the G1020 and ORIGA datasets respectively.

We employed a novel two-step engineering strategy to create novel rAAV capsids with global tissue de-targeting, then produced strong tissue-specific expression by adding a peptide sequence. We created a novel capsid, AAV.Zero1, with globally de-targeted transduction by loop swapping domains from AAV9 into AAV2. Making an R585A substitution (AAV.Zero2) re-targeted tissues but deleting residues 585-587 (AAV.Zero3) abrogated transduction. Inserting a myogenic peptide into AAV.Zero3 produced a novel capsid (AAV.eM) with strong muscle-specific transgene expression while maintaining minimal off-target expression, including in liver, which was conserved in two mouse strains and non-human primates. AAV.eM showed similar expression as the leading myotropic vector MyoAAV.4A but had a more favorable safety profile. Importantly, AAV.eM was able to functionally rescue a mouse model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy following systemic delivery of a micro-dystrophin gene. Thus, AAV.eM is an improved myotropic rAAV capsid that de-targets other tissues, especially the liver, and proof-of-concept for a platform to create capsids with specific properties that translate across species by addition of peptides onto low transduction backbones.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Housing mice below thermoneutrality, specifically at 22 degrees Celsius, causes cold stress, and dosing outside the circadian immune peak dampens anti-tumour immunity. We hypothesised that eliminating both these factors would render B16-F10 curable. Methods: Forty C57BL/6 mice with B16-F10 tumours were randomised to one of four groups: conventional conditions (22 degrees Celsius; PD-1 administered at Zeitgeber time 22, which is 2:00 AM), chronotherapy only (22 degrees Celsius; PD-1 at Zeitgeber time 4, which is 8:00 AM), thermoneutrality only (30 degrees Celsius; PD-1 at Zeitgeber time 22), or the double-hit condition (30 degrees Celsius; PD-1 at Zeitgeber time 4). Anti-PD-1, at a dose of 200 micrograms administered intraperitoneally, was given on days 3, 6, 9, and 12. Tumour volume, tumour weight, animal survival, and day-14 serum interferon-gamma levels were recorded. A synergy threshold, defined as a Delta value greater than or equal to 20 percent, was prespecified. Results: By day 14, tumours in the control group measured an average of 1207 (plus or minus a standard error of 48) cubic millimeters. Chronotherapy slowed growth to an average of 737 (plus or minus 55) cubic millimeters, and thermoneutrality slowed growth to an average of 565 (plus or minus 28) cubic millimeters (with a p-value less than 0.0001 for both compared to controls). The double-hit condition virtually halted progression, with tumours averaging 43 (plus or minus 12) cubic millimeters, representing a 96 percent reduction (p-value less than 10 to the power of minus 18). This group also generated seven complete responses and achieved 100 percent survival. Interferon-gamma levels increased 8.8-fold in the double-hit group compared to controls, measuring an average of 430 (plus or minus 24) picograms per milliliter versus 48 (plus or minus 7) picograms per milliliter, respectively (p-value less than 10 to the power of minus 19). The Bliss Delta value was 25 percent, confirming synergy. Conclusions: Concurrent removal of cold stress and circadian mistiming unmasks a curative PD-1 response in refractory melanoma. Because warming blankets and morning infusion slots are readily available in clinical settings, these data outline a practical new tactic to rescue PD-1 efficacy in tumours typically considered \"cold\" or unresponsive.

Self-incompatibility and flowering phenology further limit generational advances and field testing of chestnuts. Our work here demonstrates that long generational times and field constraints can be circumvented by producing both male and receptive female flowers in controlled indoor environments. Additionally, we developed an embryo rescue protocol for both indoor and field conditions, in which developing embryos can be extracted and micropropagated from immature seeds between 6- and 8-weeks post pollination. These advances have enabled production of the first homozygous transgenic American chestnuts, which have produced pollen that was used for outdoor controlled pollinations and yielded nearly 100% transgene inheritance by offspring. This work also provides event-specific DNA markers to differentiate transgenic chestnut lines and identify homozygous individuals.

Persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.), a major fruit crop in East Asia, shows diversity in fruit shape among cultivars. The underlying molecular mechanisms that determine fruit shape remain unclear. A comparative physiological analysis was conducted to investigate the differences between a major Japanese cultivar, 'Hiratanenashi' with a ''flat'' fruit shape, and its somaclonal mutant cultivar, 'Koushimaru' with a ''round'' fruit shape. Through principal component analysis (PCA) with the elliptic Fourier descriptor, the fruit shape transitions in these two cultivars were measured over the fruit differentiation period (40-53 days after anthesis). Histological observation of the mesocarp cells in the fruit shape differentiation stage indicated that not only cell proliferation patterns but also multiple vectors involving cell shapes or sizes are possible determinants of differences in fruit shape. Transcriptome analysis at the fruit shape differentiation stage detected differentially expressed genes between the two cultivars. The hierarchical clustering with expression patterns throughout the fruit development/maturation stages defined four main clusters, including candidate genes determining fruit shapes. We focused on one of these genes, DKAch04a32073.t1, annotated as WUSCHEL related homeobox 13 (WOX13), which has been reported to be a key factor in callus formation (or stem cell proliferation) and the reconnection of organs in Arabidopsis thaliana.

U.; Wolf, S.", "abstract": "At the basis of plant developmental plasticity are continuously active pluripotent stem cells, which fuel the life-long post-embryonic formation of new organs. Since plant cells are encased in cell walls and thus immotile, their individual fate-specification program is dependent on their relative position within the organism. It is assumed that the cell wall and its mechanical properties are under surveillance, linking cell wall state to intracellular gene-regulatory networks. However, the role of these cell wall signalling pathways in plant development and the contribution of cell wall properties to cell behaviour and identity are unclear. Here, we show that control of cell wall properties is essential for the perpetuation of stem cell populations and pattering in the shoot apical meristems. The expression of pectin methylesterases (PMEs), which modify homogalacturonan methylesterification and thereby modulate cell wall mechanics, is maintained at low levels in stem cells by the stem cell specifying transcription factor WUS. Low PME expression is required for stemness, auxin patterning and stem cell-specific mechanical properties. Conversely, WUS depletion reduces wall stiffness in the meristem centre, reinforcing its role in maintaining mechanical homeostasis. Together, our findings show that WUS-mediated control of cell wall-modifying enzymes is essential for sustaining stem cell identity and SAM organization. These results demonstrat that the plant cell wall is not only involved in cell differentiation, but also exerts feedback control on developmental transitions, contributing to our understanding how the immediate physical environment is able to guide cell fate decisions in plants.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Since the excitatory neurotransmitters mediating oxygen sensing in anamniotes have never been confirmed, the origins of oxygen sensing in vertebrates have remained controversial. In gills isolated from Tg(elavl3:GCaMP6s) zebrafish expressing a genetically-encoded reporter of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), we demonstrate that acetylcholine (ACh) and nicotine induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i in postsynaptic sensory neurons innervating oxygen-chemoreceptive neuroepithelial cells (NECs). Hypoxic stimulation of NECs evoked a similar rise in neuronal [Ca2+]i that was abolished by nicotinic antagonist, hexamethonium. Using immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR, we identified a novel population of ACh-containing NECs associated with sensory neurons expressing the a2 subunit of nicotinic ACh receptors. In vivo whole-larva Ca2+ imaging showed that cholinergic and hypoxic activation of the gills generated Ca2+ activity in neurons of vagal sensory ganglia with time-dependent characteristics of neurotransmission towards the hindbrain. We identified a second source of hypoxic activity in vagal sensory ganglia operating exclusively through 5-HT3 receptors and dependent upon vesicular monoamine transport (VMAT2) in the gill. We traced expression of 5-HT3 receptors to nerve terminals surrounding a separate population of serotonergic VMAT2-positive NECs.

Here, we identify the roles that conventional and alternative carbon metabolism genes and metabolic pathways have in facilitating C. auris growth through laboratory-based experiments and bioinformatics analyses. In artificial skin-like media, all four clades of C. auris were more capable of growing than C. albicans SC5314, a clinically relevant counterpart. By investigating the differential regulation of C. auris when growing in skin-like media as compared to rich fungal media, we uncovered hundreds of genes in multiple metabolic pathways. To further test the mechanisms of these metabolic pathways, we deleted several non-essential gene candidates including FOX2 (B9J08_002847), CAT2 (B9J08_000010), and ICL1 (B9J08_003374). The mutant strains all exhibited abrogated growth in skin-like media and demonstrated nutrient preferences that differed from the wild type.

Any emerging disease would endanger it even further, so health surveillance is crucial. Currently, health monitoring relies on lynx carcass surveillance. In parallel, the Eurasian lynx population is being monitored since 1997 through a large network of observers in different regions and this trove of camera-trap images could allow for the opportunistic detection of clinical signs. Camera traps have been used for a very long time in ecology and, more recently, in epidemiology to study e.g. sarcoptic mange.

Different factors affect image quality and the detection of changes: intrinsic camera parameters like the type and settings of the camera trap, extrinsic factors like the external lighting conditions or the position of the animal in relation to the camera. In our data set, clearly visible cutaneous changes were associated with a different set of factors than visible abnormal body conditions. The camera-trap conditions currently used for ecological monitoring of the lynx are sufficiently diverse to allow for the general surveillance of abnormal health signs.

Pennycuick (1996) proposed that wingbeat frequency (w) should vary with the square root of body mass (m), w {propto} {surd}m, when other variables influencing wingbeat frequency are held constant. 3. We present a state-space model that estimates instantaneous changes in body mass by modelling this relationship with wingbeat frequency using animal-borne accelerometer and depth data. To demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed method, we applied it to biologging data from 55 thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia) during the incubation period. 4.

However, 79% of foraging trips were associated with mass deficits. We performed simulation studies to assess the sensitivity of our method to parameter misspecification and the increase in accuracy gained from including the known mass at recapture.

Functional enrichment highlighted recurrent use of lipid transfer proteins, heat shock proteins and other drought-associated cryoprotectants. We next explored whether these conserved signatures extended to other tissues within Tripsacum and their orthologous genes in cold-sensitive maize. Comparisons with mRNA studies revealed that rhizome proteomic responses more closely resemble those of seedling leaves than roots, consistent with their shoot-derived anatomical identity, a pattern less pronounced in maize seedlings. Overall, the independent evolution of rhizome frost tolerance in PACMAD grasses appears to be governed by similar mechanisms driven primarily by expression-level changes complemented by protein structural adaptations offering candidate targets for improving freezing tolerance in maize.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

In the maximum likelihood analysis, we recovered the same basic relationships as in the previous studies, but with two major differences: i) Balanophoraceae in the broad sense are monophyletic and well supported as embedded in Santalaceae (rather than biphyletic and outside Santalaceae) and ii) most of the former Olacaceae form a moderately supported clade (rather than a weakly supported grade). In the parsimony analysis, the position of Balanophoraceae s.l. is not well supported (although their broader circumscription is). We outline three possible options for a classification of the order and propose a new familial and subfamilial classification for Santalales. This hopefully provides a stable, user-friendly taxonomic framework that is phylogenetically well supported and more consistent with historical usage than some recently proposed systems, and provides taxa that can be more readily diagnosed morphologically. We recommend recognition of nine families (in phylogenetic sequence): Strombosiaceae, Erythropalaceae, Olacaceae, Opiliaceae, Santalaceae, Misodendraceae, Schoepfiaceae and Loranthaceae, plus an unresolved position for Balanophoraceae (including Mystropetalaceae), which we propose to exclude from Santalaceae until more evidence of their relationships to that family is available from nuclear genes. Four new subfamilies, Gaiadendroideae, Comandroideae, Nanodeoideae and Thesioideae, are proposed, and a new combination, Loranthus obtusifolius, is made.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

As a herpesvirus, EBV establishes lifelong infection, and over 90% of U.S. adults are EBV-seropositive. Despite its significant disease burden, no approved EBV vaccines or therapeutics exist. Among EBV envelope glycoproteins, the fusion protein (gB) is strictly required for epithelial and B cell infection. Using a combination of AlphaFold-guided modeling, rational design, and ThermoMPNN-informed optimization, we engineered a stabilized prefusion gB variant, D2C3. This construct incorporates two inter-protomeric disulfide bonds and three cavity-filling substitutions, resulting in a melting temperature of 54 {degrees}C. Cryo-EM analysis of this construct allowed us to determine the prefusion structure of EBV gB, providing insights into the structural transitions required to adopt the postfusion conformation. Murine immunizations and depletion studies with human sera suggested a trend toward improved functional immunogenicity of D2C3 compared to postfusion gB. Collectively, these studies define engineering principles to stabilize class III fusion proteins, provide reagents to interrogate the human antibody response to EBV gB, and lay a foundation for further studies to develop EBV gB-based vaccine candidates.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Conventional approaches inadequately leverage the complementary nature of multimodal data, resulting in overfitting when handling high-dimensional omics data and constraining the comprehensive characterization of cancer subtype heterogeneity. To address this, Triad-LMF, a novel multi-omics integration framework, is introduced, leveraging a low-rank multimodal fusion mechanism to improve the Accuracy of cancer subtype classification. Triad-LMF consolidates multi-omics datasets, mitigating feature dimension disparities through optimized preprocessing. To enable efficient multimodal information integration, Triad-LMF implements a two-stage hierarchical fusion strategy, where in Local Pairwise Fusion and Global Triadic Fusion are combined via the Two-Feature and Three-way LMF modules, facilitating a progressive transition from local modality interactions to global feature integration. Experimental results demonstrate that Triad-LMF outperforms traditional machine learning methods and previous published methods in classification performance. UMAP verifies that Global Triadic Fusion significantly enhances the ability to discriminate against subtypes in implicit space representation. We further illustrate the effectiveness of Triad-LMF in making full use of multimodal interactive information. Additionally, SHAP feature importance analysis was adopted for extracting the important features. Moreover, across independent datasets, Triad-LMF demonstrates superior generalization capabilities.

Interpreting these systems through image segmentation requires the effective propagation and integration of information across different scales. However, most existing segmentation methods are optimised for single-scale imaging modalities, limiting their ability to capture and analyse small functional units throughout complete human organs. To facilitate multi-scale biomedical image segmentation, we utilised Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT), an advanced imaging modality that can generate 3D multi-scale datasets from high-resolution regions of interest (ROIs) at ~2 m/voxel to whole-organ scans at ~20 m/voxel. Building on these hierarchical multi-scale datasets, we developed a deep learning-based segmentation pipeline that is initially trained on manually annotated high-resolution HiP-CT data and then extended to lower-resolution whole-organ scans using pseudo-labels generated from high-resolution predictions and multi-scale image registration. As a case study, we focused on glomeruli in human kidneys, evaluating four deep learning models for 3D biomedical segmentation on high-resolution data. Among them, nnUNet demonstrated the best performance and was subsequently used as the baseline model for multi-scale segmentation in the pipeline. Applying this model to full-organ low-resolution data enabled comprehensive morphological analyses, including cortical spatial statistics and glomerular distributions, which aligned well with previous anatomical studies. Our results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed pipeline for segmenting small functional units in multi-scale bioimaging datasets and suggest its broader applicability to other organ systems.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Recent investigations of MIF and MIF-2 have shown them to possess N-to-C-terminal allosteric crosstalk, but despite the similarity of this \"allosteric pathway,\" its regulation of MIF and MIF-2 is not identical. Thus, structure alone does not preserve the precise allosteric mechanism and additional residues that modulate MIF and MIF-2 allosteric function must be characterized. Cysteines have been identified as allosteric switches for the same biochemical functions of MIF and small molecules targeting its N-terminal enzymatic site have affected the structure of three proximal cysteines. Ebselen is a compound that forms covalent selenylsulfide bonds with MIF cysteines and is hypothesized to destabilize and dissociate the MIF trimer into monomers. Ebselen-bound MIF also displays little-to-no catalysis or biological signaling. However, it is unclear whether Ebselen similarly affects the MIF-2 paralog, despite MIF-2 containing two related cysteines (MIF contains three). We used mutagenesis, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in vitro and in vivo biochemistry to investigate the mechanism of Ebselen as an allosteric modulator of MIF-2 via its cysteines. Our findings suggest that Ebselen partially disrupts the MIF-2 homotrimer, though the overall population of such a structure is <35%, even on the timescale of many hours. Ebselen does attenuate the biological functions of MIF-2 and solution structural biology captures the conformational transitions preceding the destabilized MIF-2 trimer.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Background: The rise of bacterial resistance has driven the exploration of novel therapies, such as bacteriophage-antibiotic cocktails (PACs), which have shown in vitro promise against resistant pathogens, including daptomycin non-susceptible (DNS-MRSA) strains. While daptomycin has been a cornerstone for treating MRSA bacteremia and vancomycin-refractory infective endocarditis, the emergence of DNS-MRSA presents a significant challenge due to high morbidity, mortality, and rapid intrinsic resistance development. Methods: Phages Intesti13 and Sb-1, were selected for their unique host ranges and activity against sixteen DNS-MRSA strains. Synergy with antibiotics was assessed via growth suppression curves and 24-hour time-kill assays (TKAs) across administration sequences and MIC increments. Selected regimens were further assessed in an ex-vivo simulated endocardial vegetation (SEV) models, with pharmacokinetic analyses confirming target antibiotic concentrations. Results: In the ex-vivo SEV model, simultaneous PAC administration using daptomycin{+/-}phage, showed superior bactericidal activity over sequential treatments in isolate C6 (p<0.01). Similarly, in the same model, C2 reached detection limits within 48h and remained suppressed for 120h (p<0.0037). Sequential outcomes varied by phage-antibiotic order and antibiotic choice. Simultaneous and phage-first regimens outperformed antibiotic-first, especially in 24h TKAs, but showed variability at lower MICs and between in-vitro and ex-vivo settings. Conclusion: This study highlights PAC's potential for DNS-MRSA treatment, emphasizing the importance of administration timing. The observed differences across clinical strains emphasize the need for strain-specific evaluations and a deeper understanding of phage-antibiotic interactions to optimize therapy. Future research must focus on expanding phage diversity, refining protocols, and clinically validating sequential strategies to enhance PAC efficacy.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

There is a need for an accessible set of acquisition guidelines such that a baseline level of data quality can be attained regardless of domain expertise or specialized equipment (i.e. in anesthetized, free-breathing mice). In particular, there is a gap in the literature regarding the interpretation of physiological parameters as markers of anesthetic depth, and ultimately, data quality. To this end, we developed a set of acquisition guidelines after examining whether continuous physiological variables predict network detectability above and beyond categorical external variables (anesthetic dose, session, time) in C57Bl/7 and C3HeB/FeJ mice anesthetized with isoflurane-dexmedetomidine. Standard physiological metrics (respiration rate and heart rate) did not predict network detectability above and beyond anesthetic dose but instead depended strongly on strain and subject, thus we advise against tuning anesthesia based on respiration or heart rate when the goal is obtaining clear resting-state networks. The most important predictor of improved network detectability was a low isoflurane dose of 0.23%, hence we recommend that researchers prioritize piloting the minimal possible isoflurane dose for their mouse model. In summary, our work examines the contributions from sources of variability that impact rs-fMRI data quality and synthesizes the findings into practical guidelines to help experimenters adapt their acquisition protocols and improve data quality.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Development, the processes by which traits are generated, unfolds over an individual's lifetime; heredity, encompassing the diverse forms of information transmission, occurs across generations; and population and ecological change often take place over even longer temporal horizons. Capturing these layered dynamics in a formal mathematical framework is essential for advancing evolutionary theory in line with recent conceptual developments, such as Extended Evolutionary Theory (EET) or the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES). In this work, we introduce the Extended Life Cycle (ELC), a multiscale mathematical modeling framework that centers the life cycle as the fundamental unit of evolutionary analysis. In contrast to traditional gene-centric approaches, the ELC formalism captures the nested temporal structure and multilevel causal architecture of biological systems by modeling development, heredity, population, and ecological dynamics across distinct but interacting timescales. Each layer is expressed as a stochastic state-space model, enabling feedback across levels and accommodating diverse interaction topologies and inheritance systems. We demonstrate the utility of the ELC through a Bayesian simulation to estimate latent dynamics across three time scales. By formalizing the life cycle as a dynamic scaffold, the ELC offers a flexible foundation for modeling evolution in complex systems.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Since Weddell's work, family delimitation has been modified and many genera described in a fragmented manner. Over the past two decades, numerous molecular studies have supported the inclusion of Cecropiaceae within Urticaceae and identified paraphyly in several genera, notably Laportea, Urera, Boehmeria, Parietaria, Pellionia, and Pouzolzia. However, few studies have translated these molecular insights into a revised taxonomy. This study aimed to provide a robust, updated classification for Urticaceae by: a) increasing taxon and genomic locus sampling through the integration of newly generated sequence data with previously published datasets; and b) incorporating morphological data to support a revised delimitation of tribes and genera, and to establish a new linear sequence for the family. We also sought to identify remaining taxonomic challenges. Using Sanger and Angiosperms353 sequence data, we constructed a phylogenetic framework for 57 out of 59 currently accepted genera. We also assessed the phylogenetic informativeness of 57 morphological characters by mapping them onto the phylogeny. Our analyses support the delimitation of 61 monophyletic genera and an infrafamilial classification comprising seven tribes, two of which we describe as new: Myriocarpeae and Leukosykeae. We provide a revised linear sequence for the family. Our classification reinstates several names previously treated as synonyms (Fleurya, Leptocnide, Margarocarpus, Polychroa, Scepocarpus, Sceptrocnide), places several genera in synonymy (Hemistylus and Rousselia under Pouzolzia; Hesperocnide under Urtica; Gesnouinia and Soleirolia under Parietaria), and proposes the recognition of two new genera, Muimar gen. nov. and Pouzolziella gen. nov., to accommodate Boehmeria nivea and Pouzolzia australis, respectively. Mapping morphological characters onto the phylogeny indicates that while most states are homoplastic at the family level, their combination is valuable for recognizing genera. Geographic character mapping suggests a high degree of spatial conservatism at the genus rank. Our dated ultrametric tree suggests an origin for Urticaceae in Indomalaya during the mid-Cretaceous, followed by establishment in the Laurasian boreotropical flora and subsequent dispersal to the neotropics and Africa. Once classified within an evolutionary framework we believe that the Urticaceae represent a valuable study system in evolutionary biology for investigating transitions across biomes, the drivers of floral trait evolution, and intrinsic speciation mechanisms.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Specifically, E4BP4 interacts with PRDM16 to repress Cers6 mRNA expression and consequently reduces C16:0 ceramide levels by binding to a 65 kb upstream enhancer region of the Cers6 gene. Notably, the preservation of mitochondrial integrity in BAT by E4BP4 gain-of-function improves systemic glucose homeostasis, independent of weight loss. Collectively, our findings establish E4BP4 as a molecular safeguard against obesity-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and oxidative dysfunction, primarily by suppressing ceramide synthesis in brown fat.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Leveraging data from MoTrPAC, we analyzed liver adaptations across 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of exercise in male and female rats using multi-omic approaches. Female livers displayed a progressive increase in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes (at the protein level), while male livers showed an increase in acetylation of OXPHOS, TCA cycle, and fatty acid oxidation enzymes. Exercise also enhanced liver cholesterol and bile acid synthesis, reducing liver lipid metabolites in males after 8 weeks of exercise. Male rats had higher fecal cholesterol and cholic acid levels, indicating a sex-specific mechanism of lipid excretion with exercise. Moreover, 8 weeks of training reduced markers related to hepatic stellate cell activation and fibrosis in both sexes. This study highlights the sexual dimorphic and temporal molecular signatures by which exercise modulates liver metabolism to provide hepatoprotective effects.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

G.; Sun, Y.; Roumeliotis, T. I.; Choudhary, J. S.; Fisher, J.", "abstract": "Computational models have become essential tools for understanding signalling networks and their non-linear dynamics. However, these models are typically constructed manually using prior knowledge and can be over-reliant on study bias. These limitations hinder their ability to make accurate predictions and incorporate new evidence. Scaling up the construction of models to take advantage of increasingly abundant 'omics data can bridge these gaps by providing a comprehensive view of signalling events and how they influence cellular phenotypes. In this study, we present MAGELLAN, a method leveraging message passing graph neural networks to build computational models directly from pathway data and discrete rules representing experimental results. We used this to construct a computational model of breast cancer signalling and re-parameterize a previously published non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) model, showing that MAGELLAN can predict genetic dependencies and achieve comparable model quality to expert-curated and manually trained models. Our approach enables the integration of prior knowledge networks and experimental data to build predictive models that are mechanistically interpretable. This approach simplifies model creation, making it more accessible and practical for experimentalists, and supports broader applications in drug discovery and biological research.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "This study developed a new Cellular Omics-Structural Integration (COSI) technology platform to address the limitation of traditional technologies in simultaneously obtaining gene expression profiles and super-resolution cellular structural information at the single-cell level. The platform comprises three core functional modules: (1) a single-cell transcriptomics and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy integration module that enables simultaneous acquisition of gene expression profiles and super-resolution fluorescence images at the single-cell level; (2) an electron microscopy and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy integration module with deep learning resolution enhancement that further gives fluorescence image high resolution features; and (3) a comprehensive analysis module that integrates transcriptomic data with enhanced super-resolution morphological data. Application of this technology to primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells successfully achieved efficient matching and analysis of ultrastructural information and gene transcription data at the single-cell level, revealing associations between specific genes and endothelial cell fenestration formation. Through correlation analysis and multivariate statistical methods, we identified specific gene sets associated with fenestration number and average area. Validation in published non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and diabetic mouse models demonstrated that these gene sets can effectively assess disease status and drug intervention efficacy, with fenestration number-related gene sets showing significant reduction in NASH and time-dependent changes in response to diabetes treatments. These findings not only expand our understanding of the mechanisms underlying liver and kidney endothelial cell fenestration formation but also provide novel molecular markers and potential therapeutic targets for early diagnosis and treatment evaluation of metabolic diseases. As a fundamental research tool, COSI technology fills critical gaps in existing spatial omics and cellular biology research, particularly for studying cellular structures lacking specific markers, and demonstrates significant potential for clinical applications in chronic metabolic diseases.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Visual responses in the cerebral cortex are strongly influenced by shifts in spatial attention. This modulation of visual processing includes changes in firing rate, decreased response variability, and decreased interneuronal correlations; all of which are thought to underlie enhanced visual perception near the center of attention at the cost of visual perception at other locations. Visual information from the retina is relayed to primary visual cortex via neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the dorsal thalamus. Although early studies describe an enhancement of LGN activity with spatial attention, more recent work has cast doubt on this view. Given its strategic position as the gateway to the cortex, an understanding of the effects of attention on visual processing in the LGN is important. We therefore performed experiments to reexamine the influence of covert spatial attention on the spiking activity of single units in the macaque LGN and applied a broad set of analyses and functional metrics to assess possible effects. Our results reveal a statistically significant effect of spatial attention in the LGN: firing rates were slightly higher and more reliable when monkeys directed attention towards the receptive fields of recorded neurons compared to when attention was directed to different retinotopic locations. However, effects were much smaller than previously reported (~1% vs ~4%) and further analyses suggest that effects are weak and inconsistent. Thus, while spatial attention does exert an influence in the LGN, its effects are weak and may have limited impact on downstream processing.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

C.; Mason, T.; Krogh, M.; Cairns, J.; Keith, D.", "abstract": "Indicator species are typically used to infer the presence of other biota or specific environmental conditions. Here we use indicator species to quantify the hydrological niche of their corresponding vegetation communities within Coastal Upland Swamps of the Sydney Basin Bioregion, Australia. Swamp vegetation organizes naturally into five recognised communities, thought to occupy distinct positions along a hydrological gradient. However, longwall mining reduces hydro-period, potentially impacting the observed vegetation. We modelled the hydrological niche for each community using the relative frequency of 20 vascular plant indicator species (four for each community) and time series soil moisture data from 11 unmined sites across four swamps. We then used this model to predict indicator species frequencies in 3 mine-impacted sites. Indicator species were modelled as a function of the average number of days-per-year that swamps remained saturated at the base of the root zone (30 cm below surface). Hydrological niches were well differentiated for four communities with the estimated optimal mean annual days-per-year saturated ranging from Restioid heath at 16 [<16, 29] (mean +/- [95% uncertainty]) to Ti-tree thicket at 352 [322, >353]. Banksia thicket 96 [65, 154] and Cyperoid heath 257 [204, 297] communities were intermediate to these. However, Sedgeland indicator species showed limited variation with changing saturation, and their hydrological niche remains unclear. The model under-predicted the frequency of Cyperoid heath and over-predicted Banksia thicket indicator species in mine-impacted sites, suggesting vegetation is not yet in equilibrium with hydrology. Results suggest indicator species can provide a reliable basis for determining the hydrological niche of wetland plant communities, which can in turn predict community-level impacts of hydrological change.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Understanding how growth might vary among species with similar traits can improve predictions of population status and responses to environmental change. We used geostatistical models to characterize spatiotemporal variability in growth rate and body condition, two interrelated traits associated with somatic growth, of nine commercially important U.S. West Coast groundfish species with a range of life-history traits and depth distributions. Our models uncover spatiotemporal variability in growth rate and body condition in all nine groundfish species with limited trends shared among species with similar traits, suggesting a greater influence from niche partitioning acting on local scales. Such interspecific differences in growth rate and body condition responses also occurred at regional scales, with some species exhibiting positive responses while others declined. These findings reveal the dynamic nature of somatic growth among groundfish species and provide insight into potential mechanisms of its variability that could be considered within climate-enhanced assessments of population status for marine fish.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

O.", "abstract": "Avian plumage maturation involves replacing feathers, via discrete molts, until reaching an iteratively-regenerated definitive plumage. This process usually takes about one year. In the Neotropical lekking manakins (Pipridae), males of most species exhibit delayed plumage maturation (DPM), passing through drab predefinitive plumages for two or three years before reaching a bright, sexually dimorphic, definitive plumage. We used a phylogenetic analysis to investigate the evolutionary history of DPM in manakins. Our unique comparative dataset derived characters from a graph structure representing the developmental schedules of individual, colorful plumage patches. We traced the origin of one-year DPM to the ancestor of sexually dichromatic Piprinae manakins, followed by three separate origins of prolonged, two-year DPM, plus one subsequent extension to three-year DPM. Consistent with social signaling hypotheses, prolonged DPM evolved to reveal and maintain signals of young male status. This interspecific pattern sheds light on the sociosexual development of lekking birds, a topic usually restricted to autecological field studies. By detailing heterochronic dynamics in manakin plumage evolution, we also show how the iterative regeneration of characters like bird feathers, insect instars, mammalian antlers, and angiosperm flowers can create multiple distinct levels of developmental homologies among bodies, sexes, and species.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}

Outbred populations, like the Diversity Outbred (DO), are commonly genotyped using commercial SNP arrays, such as the Giga Mouse Universal Genotyping Array (GigaMUGA). However, array genotypes are expensive to collect, subject to significant ascertainment bias, and too sparse to capture the genetic structure of highly recombined mouse crosses. We investigated the efficacy of sequencing-based genotyping by comparing genotyping results between the GigaMUGA, double-digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq), and low-coverage whole-genome sequencing (lcWGS). We aligned reads at ~1X coverage and imputed segregating SNPs from the eight DO founder strains onto 48 DO genomes and reconstructed their haplotypes using R/qtl2. Haplotype reconstructions derived from all three methods were highly concordant. However, lcWGS more faithfully recapitulated crossover counts and identified more small (< 1 Mb) haplotype blocks at as low as 0.1X coverage. Over 90% of local expression quantitative trait loci identified in a set of 183 DO-derived embryoid bodies using the GigaMUGA were recalled by lcWGS at coverages as low as 0.1X. We recommend that lcWGS be adopted as the primary method of genotyping complex crosses, and cell-based resources derived from them because they are as accurate as array-based reconstructions, robust to ultra-low sequencing depths, may more accurately model haplotypes of the mouse genome that are difficult to resolve with dense reference data, and cost-effective.", "date": "2025-05-19", "journal": ""}
