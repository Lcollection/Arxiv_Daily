These transcription factors coordinate nutrient sensing with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism across the evolutionary spectrum. While most studies have focused on the downstream outputs, little is known about the upstream inputs that regulate these transcription factors in a live organism. Here, we found that knockdown of various glucose metabolic enzymes decreases MML-1 localization in the nucleus and identified two hexokinase isozymes, hxk-1 and hxk-2, as the most vigorous regulators of MML-1 function. Upon hexokinase knockdown, MML-1 redistributes to mitochondria and lipid droplets (LD) and concomitantly, transcriptional targets are downregulated and germline longevity is abolished. Further, we found that hxk-1 regulates MML-1 through mitochondrial {beta}oxidation, while hxk-2 regulates MML-1 by modulating the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and its coordinated association with lipid droplets. Similarly, inhibition of the PPP rescues mammalian MondoA nuclear translocation and transcriptional function upon starvation.

Here we demonstrate that S. aureus strains lacking the the T7SS effector EsxC ({Delta}esxC) was highly sensitive to the important last resort drug, daptomycin, as well as other membrane-targeting antibiotics, including gramicidin and bithionol. To understand how EsxC mediates increased antibiotic sensitivity, we investigated its functions in the staphylococcal cell envelope. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of an esxC mutant revealed a distinct cell surface morphology. Interestingly, {Delta}esxC displayed a decrease in membrane fluidity, altered membrane protein profiles and altered cell wall synthesis. The esxC mutant demonstrated enhanced daptomycin binding which correlated with the increased negative charge of mutant membranes. Calcium ions, which can bind membranes affecting charge, impacted growth of {Delta}esxC and sensitivity to daptomycin, suggesting that EsxC may modulate calcium binding to membranes. Furthermore, the esxC mutant displayed a heightened susceptibility to daptomycin during intracellular infection, and in a murine skin infection model. Thus, our data show that the T7SS effector EsxC impacts sensitivity of S. aureus to membrane-acting drugs such as daptomycin through modulation of cell membrane integrity, indicating its potential as a drug target.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Using two-photon optogenetics, we measure neural responses to natural images and play them back, finding responses are boosted when inputs are played back during the correct movie dynamic context - when the preceding sequence corresponds to natural vision. This sequence selectivity depends on a network mechanism: earlier input patterns produce responses in other local neurons, which interact with later input patterns.

This adhesion is mediated by focal adhesions, a protein complex linking the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton. Focal adhesions have been studied extensively in Metazoan mesenchymal cells, but recent research in physiological contexts and amoeboid cells suggest that focal adhesion regulation differs from the mesenchymal focal adhesion paradigm. While focal adhesion machinery predates the origin of Metazoans, focal adhesion formation and regulation during non-Metazoan cell migration is largely unexplored. We used Dictyostelium discoideum to investigate novel mechanisms and the evolution of focal adhesion regulation, as Dictyostelium are non-Metazoans that form cell-substrate adhesion structures for migration. We show that PaxillinB, the Dictyostelium homologue of Paxillin, localizes to dynamic cell-substrate adhesions. As expected, PaxillinB mutations decreased the number of cell-substrate adhesions. Unexpectedly, however, decreased cell-substrate adhesion number led to an increase in cell migration speed. These findings are in direct contrast to Paxillin function at focal adhesions and regulation of cell migration in mammalian cells, challenging the established focal adhesion model and providing insight into the evolution of cell-substrate adhesions and Paxillin function during cell migration.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

We found that HZ respiration predicted by process-based models did not explain spatial variation in field estimates of ERtot.

We propose that ERtot is influenced by processes that integrate contributions from sediment components beyond the HZ, such as benthic algae and submerged macrophytes, which are key primary producers in rivers.

Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel therapeutic targets and strategies to overcome metastasis. A series of in vitro and in vivo phenotype experiments were performed to investigate the role of PDE1A in NSCLC. The RIP assay, mRNA stability assay and LC-MS/MS were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of PDE1A in NSCLC progression. We demonstrated that phosphodiesterase 1A (PDE1A) promoted metastasis and EMT progression of NSCLC. In addition, NSCLC cells overexpressing PDE1A promoted angiogenesis by regulating exosome release. IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway was highly enriched in PDE1A-coexpresssed genes, and PDE1A promoted NSCLC metastasis by activating the STAT3 pathway. GO enrichment analysis of PDE1A-interacting genes showed that PDE1A might interact with YTHDF2 and participate in m6A-containing RNA binding. The binding between PDE1A and YTHDF2 was verified, and PDE1A regulated the STAT3 pathway by interacting with YTHDF2. The mechanism of YTHDF2/PDE1A complex in regulating STAT3 pathway was predicted by overlapping YTHDF2-interacting-RNAs, and genes coexpressed with YTHDF2 and STAT3. The interactions between YTHDF2 and target mRNAs were predicted, and there were three predicted targets of YTHDF2 with high scores: NRF2, SOCS2, and MET. Indeed, PDE1A interacted with YTHDF2, destabilized SOCS2, and activated STAT3 pathway.

Particularly, the size of active zones (AZs) and the readily releasable, recycling and resting pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) were quantified. The majority of excitatory SBs contained numerous mitochondria comprising ~7% of the total volume, had a large macular, non-perforated AZ (~0.20 um2) and were predominantly located on dendritic spines. Excitatory SBs had a total pool of ~3500 SVs, a relatively large readily releasable (~4 SVs), recycling (~470 SVs) and resting (~2900 SVs) pool.

We address this question in the olfactory system, decoding the route by which odorants arrive into the nasal cavity: through the nostrils (orthonasal), or through the back of the throat (retronasal). We recently showed with modeling and novel experiments on anesthetized rats that orthonasal versus retronasal modality information is encoded in the olfactory bulb (OB, a pre-cortical region). However, key questions remain: is modality information transmitted from OB to anterior piriform cortex (aPC)? How can this information be extracted from a much noisier cortical population with overall less firing? With simultaneous spike recordings of populations of neurons in OB and aPC, we show that an unsupervised and biologically plausible algorithm, Shared Covariance Decoding (SCD), can indeed linearly encode modality in low dimensional subspaces. Specifically, SCD improves encoding of ortho/retro in aPC compared to Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Consistent with our theoretical analysis, when noise correlations between OB and aPC are low and OB well-encodes modality, modality in aPC tends to be encoded optimally with SCD. We observe that with several algorithms (LDA, SCD, optimal) that the decoding accuracy distributions are invariant when GABAA (ant-)agonists (bicuculline and muscimol) are applied to OB, consistent invariance in population firing in aPC.

Importantly, nematic order forms early before any discernible changes in the shapes of cells.

The spatial correlations in the nematic phase in the notochord region are long-ranged and follow a similar power-law decay (y~x^-) with  less than unity, indicating a common underlying physical mechanism. To explain the common physical mechanism, we created a theoretical model that not only explains the experimental observations but also predicts that the nematic phase should be disrupted upon loss of planar cell polarity (frog), cell adhesion (frog), and notochord boundary formation (zebrafish).

Through this new perspective, we account for the observed weak frequency-dependence of extracellular electrical stimulation-induced membrane potential changes, and demonstrate a 1/r falloff for nearby and 1/r2 falloff for distant neurons. We also show that for transcranial electrical stimulation, the susceptibility of a neuron to the stimulation is directly proportional to the size of the current dipole moment resulting from somatic current input. The induced somatic membrane potential changes are small and exhibit weak spatial but strong orientation dependency across human neocortex.

Thus, nuclear fluorescence of these molecules is proportional to the amount of nucleosome-free DNA, serving as a measure of chromatin accessibility. We optimized the method using several DNA binding molecules and known chromatin modulating agents. Using a set of tumor and non-tumor cells of different origins we observed the tendency to the higher chromatin accessibility of tumor versus non-tumor cells. Chromatin accessibility was also increased upon oncogene-induced transformation of mouse and human cells.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

We find that ER-Hoxb8 macrophages are highly comparable to primary bone marrow-derived (BMD) macrophages in vitro, and, when transplanted into a microglia-free brain, engraft the parenchyma and differentiate into microglia-like cells. Furthermore, ER-Hoxb8 progenitors are readily transducible by virus and easily stored as stable, genetically manipulated cell lines. As a demonstration of this systems power for studying the effects of disease mutations on microglia in vivo, we created stable, Adar1-mutated ER-Hoxb8 lines using CRISPR-Cas9 to study the intrinsic contribution of macrophages to Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS), an inherited interferonopathy that primarily affects the brain and immune system. We find that Adar1 knockout elicited interferon secretion and impaired macrophage production in vitro, while preventing brain macrophage engraftment in vivo - phenotypes that can be rescued with concurrent mutation of Ifih1 (MDA5) in vitro, but not in vivo. Lastly, we extended these findings by generating ER-Hoxb8 progenitors from mice harboring a patient-specific Adar1 mutation (D1113H). We demonstrated the ability of microglia-specific D1113H mutation to drive interferon production in vivo, suggesting microglia drive AGS neuropathology.

Elevated pUb levels have been observed in aged human brains and in Parkinson's disease, but the mechanistic link between pUb elevation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that pUb elevation is a common feature under neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, aging, and ischemic injury. We show that impaired proteasomal activity leads to the accumulation of sPINK1, the cytosolic form of PINK1 that is normally proteasome-degraded rapidly. This accumulation increases ubiquitin phosphorylation, which then inhibits ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal activity by interfering with both ubiquitin chain elongation and proteasome-substrate interactions. Specific expression of sPINK1 in mouse hippocampal neurons induced progressive pUb accumulation, accompanied by protein aggregation, proteostasis disruption, neuronal injury, neuroinflammation, and cognitive decline. Conversely, pink1 knockout mitigated protein aggregation in both mouse brains and HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the detrimental effects of sPINK1 could be counteracted by co-expressing Ub/S65A phospho-null mutant but exacerbated by over-expressing Ub/S65E phospho-mimic mutant. Together, these findings reveal that pUb elevation, triggered by reduced proteasomal activity, inhibits proteasomal activity and forms a feedforward loop that drives progressive neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Instead of computing individual SNP-environment associations, RDAforest seeks to explain the overall genetic covariance structure based on multiple environmental predictors. By relying on random forest instead of linear regression, this method can detect non-linear and non-monotonous dependencies as well as all possible interactions between predictors. It also incorporates a novel procedure to select the best predictor out of several correlated ones, and uses jackknifing to model uncertainty of genetic structure determination. Lastly, our methodology incorporates delineation and plotting of adaptive neighborhoods - areas on the landscape that are predicted to harbor differentially adapted individuals.

Mechanistic models, such as neutral models, have been proposed as an alternative null model, but they are computationally expensive. Here, we use an efficient method to simulate such models and to explore likely mechanisms governing the occurrence patterns of birds on islands. Location: Riau archipelago, Indonesia. Taxon: Birds. Methods: We used species richness and island area data to fit a niche--neutral model, where species obey neutral dynamics within non-overlapping discrete niches. We used a sequential sampling algorithm that can efficiently generate randomised presence--absence matrices under the niche-neutral model and used mismatches to identify which mechanisms were potentially important to occurrence patterns. Results: Birds were more segregated and less nested than expected from both data randomisation and the niche--neutral model. The niche--neutral model reproduced the mean relationship between island size and species richness, but it could not produce sufficient variability to account for the richness data. The model was brought into closer agreement with the data by allowing niche diversity to vary across islands (increased segregation) and allowing the per-capita immigration rate to vary across islands (decreased nestedness). Main conclusion: While the species-area relationship could be explained by a model with constant per-capita immigration rates and number of niches across islands, inter-island heterogeneity was needed to explain higher-order metrics of nestedness and co-occurrence patterns. The sequential sampling algorithm allowed us to explore different scenarios efficiently, and our approach may be useful for identifying the mechanisms structuring occurrence patterns in other systems.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

J.; Zavaleta, E.; Ruegg, K. C.; Hooten, M. B.", "abstract": "Identifying genomic adaptation is key to understanding species' evolutionary responses to climate change. However, current methods to identify adaptive variation have two major limitations. First, when estimating genetic variation, most methods do not account for observational uncertainty in genetic data because of finite sampling and missing genotypes. Second, current methods use phenomenological models to partition genetic variation into adaptive and non-adaptive components. These phenomenological models are not mechanistic models of evolution and, therefore, do not faithfully capture the demographic history of the species. We address these limitations by developing a hierarchical Bayesian model that explicitly accounts for both the observational uncertainty and underlying evolutionary processes. The first layer of the hierarchy is the data model that captures observational uncertainty by probabilistically linking RAD-sequence data to genetic variation. The second layer is a process model that provides a mechanistic explanation of how evolutionary forces, such as local adaptation, mutation, migration, and drift, maintain genetic variation. The third layer is the parameter model, which incorporates our knowledge about biological processes. For example, because most loci in the genome are expected to be neutral, the environmental sensitivity coefficients are assigned a regularized prior centered at zero. Together, the three models provide a rigorous probabilistic framework to identify local adaptation in wild organisms. Analysis of simulated RAD-seq data shows that our statistical model can reliably infer adaptive genetic variation. To show the real-world applicability of our method, we re-analyzed RAD-seq data (~105k SNPs) from Willow Flycatchers (Empidonax traillii) in the USA. We found 30 genes close to loci that showed a statistically significant association with temperature seasonality. Gene ontology suggests that several of these genes play a crucial role in egg mineralization, feather development, and the ability to withstand extreme temperatures. Moreover, biogeographers can easily modify the data and process models to accommodate a wide range of genetic datasets (e.g., pool and low coverage genome sequencing) and demographic histories (e.g., range shifts), allowing them to construct statistical models specific to their study system.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

We found that first-time male breeders, as well as divorced males, were paired with a female with a greater difference in MHC-IIB supertype sharing to them than expected under random mating. We did not find evidence for mate choice based MHC-IIB dissimilarity when considering females. In addition, divorce probability did not significantly vary with the MHC-IIB dissimilarity of the pair, and after a divorce, the newly formed pair was not more MHC dissimilar than the original pair.

This study aims to investigate the efficacy of drug combinations for the treatment of AML using both, AML cell lines and zebrafish embryo xenograft model. Specifically, we focus on two drug combinations; the pan-RAF inhibitor LY3009120 combined with the mTOR inhibitor sapanisertib (designated as LS), and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib combined with the ERK inhibitor ulixertinib (designated as RU). The study integrates real-time cell viability assays, xenograft imaging, and genomic analyses to assess drug efficacy and explore correlations between treatment responses and mutational profiles, particularly TP53, MUC4, HLA-B and FLT3 mutations. Both combinations demonstrated superior efficacy compared to venetoclax-based therapy, with LS notably reducing viability in MOLM-16 and SKM-1 cells, and RU showing comparable efficacy with a favorable safety profile. In zebrafish embryos, LS combination effectively inhibited the proliferation of xenografted human AML cells, as evidenced by decreased fluorescence signals, indicating cell death. The RU combination also disrupted survival of cancer cells, showing promise as a therapeutic strategy. Furthermore, a correlation was identified between drug response and mutational profiles, with TP53, MUC4, HLA-B and FLT3 mutations significantly influencing sensitivity to the LS and RU combinations. These findings support the further development of LS and RU as effective alternatives to current clinical regimens, with implications for personalized AML treatment.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

HOXA10, a transcription factor essential for uterine receptivity, is specifically downregulated in the luminal epithelium at implantation in mice, hamsters, and monkeys. Integrated CUT&RUN and transcriptomic profiling in human endometrial epithelial cells reveal that HOXA10 directly activates epithelial gene networks and represses mesenchymal programs. HOXA10 loss, both in vitro and in vivo, induces a pEMT state with increased cell motility. Mechanistically, HOXA10 represses TWIST2, a core EMT regulator; its derepression promotes mesenchymal gene expression and epithelial cell displacement.

Analyses revealed four iron peaks comprised of metalloproteins with synergistic functions, including: 1) respiratory and metabolic enzymes, 2) oxidative stress response enzymes, 3) DNA synthesis and nitrogen assimilation enzymes, and 4) denitrification enzymes and related copper enzymes. Fe peaks were larger under anoxic conditions, consistent with increased iron demand due to anaerobic metabolism and with the denitrification peak absent under oxic conditions. Three ferritins co-eluted with the first and third iron peaks, localizing iron storage with these functions.

D.; Barlaam, F.; Daligault, S.; Delpuech, C.; Szul, M. J.; Bonaiuto, J. J.; Bonnefond, M.; Schmitz, C.", "abstract": "Motor anticipation is essential for accurate and coordinated hand movements in humans. A valuable framework to study it is provided by the Bimanual Load-Lifting Task (BLLT), in which voluntarily lifting a load supported by the opposite forearm is preceded by anticipatory inhibition of the elbow flexors in the supporting arm, preventing forearm instability. In sixteen adult participants performing the BLLT, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying anticipatory inhibition. Optimal postural stabilization was observed when the elbow flexor was inhibited around 30 ms before unloading. Stronger muscle inhibition in this optimal time interval was associated with reduced excitability - indexed by high-gamma (90-130 Hz) power - and increased high-beta (18-25 Hz) power in the contralateral Supplementary Motor Area (SMA). Mediation analysis revealed that high-gamma power reduction significantly mediates the relationship between high-beta power and anticipatory inhibition. We further showed that trials containing beta bursts (22-28 Hz) exhibit optimally timed anticipatory inhibition and a concurrent decrease in high-gamma power. Directed connectivity analysis using the Phase Slope Index demonstrated that these beta bursts propagate to the SMA from the lateral prefrontal cortex (lPFC) and the elbow-related primary motor cortex (M1), both of which increase their burst probability during SMA bursts. Together, our findings suggest that, during voluntary load-lifting, optimal anticipatory muscle inhibition in the load-supporting forearm is achieved through reduced SMA excitability, mediated by beta bursts originating from an lPFC-M1-SMA network. To our knowledge, this also provides the first direct evidence that beta-band activity can exert inhibitory control over muscle function.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

A.; Zhang, H.; Schultz, S. R.", "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by progressive cognitive decline, yet the mechanisms underlying impaired memory encoding are not fully understood. To address this, we investigated hippocampal activity in 5xFAD mice performing a continuous spatial alternation task, combining head-fixed behavioural assessment with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging. 5xFAD mice exhibited deficits in alternation performance and task acquisition, which progressively worsened with age and were accompanied by behavioural hyperactivity and impaired speed modulation. Importantly, hippocampal CA1 neurons in 5xFAD mice showed impairments in spatial representation. Compared to non-5xFAD sibling controls, 5xFAD mice exhibited a lower proportion of place cells, reduced spatial information, and diminished trial-to-trial reliability. Moreover, reward location encoding was disrupted during goal-directed navigation. Despite these deficits, stable place cells retained relatively consistent spatial tuning across learning sessions. Finally, hippocampal trajectory-dependent activity (splitter cells) was significantly impaired in 5xFAD mice, with age-related declines in discriminability, reliability, and splitter extent. These impairments correlated with task performance and were more pronounced than behavioural deficits, suggesting that disrupted contextual encoding may precede and predict cognitive decline in AD. Together, our findings reveal early and progressive impairments in hippocampal spatial and contextual representations in 5xFAD mice, which contribute to behavioural deficits and provide insights into AD pathophysiology.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Microtubule dynamics are essential for MPS formation in the early stages, but transition to a passive stabilising role in mature axons.

Most pre-erythrocytic vaccines target circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the major surface antigen on Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. Antibodies targeting distinct epitopes within the central repeat region of CSP have the potential to provide protection from infection, but we have focused on developing vaccines that target a highly vulnerable CSP epitope that is targeted by the potent monoclonal antibody L9. In a previous study, we produced a pre-erythrocytic vaccine displaying a synthetic peptide representing the L9 epitope on Q-beta bacteriophage virus-like particles (VLPs). This vaccine elicited strong anti-CSP antibody responses that protected mice from malaria challenge. Here, we asked whether the structural context of the L9 epitope influences the quality of antibody responses. We compared the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of Q-beta L9 VLPs to recombinant VLPs that display the L9 peptide in a structure that is hypothesized to mimic its native conformation. Recombinant MS2 bacteriophage VLPs displaying various lengths of the L9 epitope were produced and immunogenicity and protective efficacy were evaluated in mice. Our results demonstrate that MS2 L9 VLPs, particularly those displaying longer L9 peptides and in combination with a potent novel adjuvant, elicit strong and durable antibody responses that lower malaria liver burden and prevent infection. We also compared the efficacy of L9-targeted vaccines to the licensed vaccine, RTS,S/AS01E (Mosquirix, GSK). Immunization with Q-beta L9 VLPs, MS2 L9 VLPs, and RTS,S/AS01E provided significant protection from liver-stage infection in a mouse model; immunization with Q-beta L9 VLPs elicited sterilizing immunity in the highest percentage of mice.

In part 1, we used a sentence-completion task, where humans and LLMs were presented with sentence fragments and asked to continue them. Results show that for both humans and LLMs, the presence of a mirative marker significantly increased response entropy and decreased top response probability, in line with theoretical proposals for mirative markers.

A.", "abstract": "Background: The dynamics of vector borne disease transmission depend on the abundances of vectors. The dominant malaria vector species complex of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato is a target of vector control strategies designed to reduce and eliminate malaria transmission. The three most widely distributed dominant malaria vectors within the species complex are An. arabiensis, An. coluzzii and An. gambiae sensu stricto. Methods: Previous studies across the extent of the species complex range have been restricted to annual predictions of species occurrence or relative abundance. This study incorporated relative abundance data at the species level and abundance data at the species complex level to estimate and predict daily carrying capacities of each species. Statistical models with interpretable parameters were used to gain insight into how factors such as meteorological conditions, insecticide treated net use, and human density affect the spatial and temporal predictions. The statistical models were used to predict daily equilibrium vector abundance that is an important factor in indices of malaria transmission such as the basic reproduction number and vectorial capacity. Results: At the continental scale, precipitation and temperature were important predictors of these three malaria vector species in Africa. Insecticide treated net use was negatively associated with per capita vector abundance of the An. gambiae species complex and the ratio of An. gambiae s.s. to An. arabiensis. A predicted increasing interannual trend for An. coluzzii was possibly caused by changing species identification methods over the observational period. Conclusion: The predicted equilibrium abundances of the three species showed potentially high levels of geographical overlap, niche overlap, and evidence for stable coexistence despite substantial interspecific competition. Improving collection of longitudinal species abundance data across the spatial range of the An. gambiae species complex will facilitate future explorations of causal hypotheses that relate vector abundance to control measures, malaria interventions and climate conditions.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Methods: We prospectively collected 161 radiologically guided biopsies from 45 GBM patients and conducted an immunohistochemical analysis. We also integrated single-cell RNA sequencing data to select specific markers for immune, glial, and vascular cells. We measured the expression of these genes in samples from contrast-enhancing (CE) and non-enhancing (nCE) tumor areas, vasogenic edema, and radiologically normal tissue. Correlations with resection extent and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Results: nCE biopsies exhibited neoplastic features similar to those of the tumor core. However, tumor infiltration was also found in regions classified radiologically as edema, particularly in elderly patients. We found important differences in the composition of the peripheral microenvironment between male and female GBM patients. Prognostic associations with specific cell types, such as myeloid cells, showed intertumor heterogeneity, with variations depending on patient sex, age and extent of resection.

However, measuring motor imagery ability is challenging due to its covert nature. While the Hand Laterality Judgement Task (HLJT) has been investigated as a measure of implicit motor imagery ability, our understanding of mechanisms underlying performance of the task is limited. We used a forced response paradigm to study the time-course of information processing in the HLJT. Participants (N=54) performed a modified HLJT where the time they had to process the stimulus was manipulated on a trial-by-trial basis, allowing us to reconstruct the time-course of information processing. Generalised Additive Mixed Models assessed the relationship between processing time and accuracy, which varied across rotation angles (0 to 180 in 45 steps), hand views (dorsal or palmar) or directions (medial or lateral). Stimulus rotation substantively increased the time needed to produce a correct response, although this effect was non-monotonic. Computational modelling confirmed a crucial interaction between hand view and rotation angle, identifying fundamental differences in processing for palmar stimuli with more extreme rotations (greater than 135) compared to other stimuli. Finally, a biomechanical constraints effect (i.e. faster processing of medial vs laterally rotated stimuli) was present in both views, but was only statistically significant in palmar views, again suggesting differences in processing palmar and dorsal stimuli.

In particular, a single exposure to stress facilitates reward learning in male rats. Since stress can produce distinct behavioral phenotypes between males and females, it is critical to additionally determine how stress impacts reward learning in females. To address this, female rats were exposed to restraint stress immediately prior to training on an appetitive Pavlovian conditioning task with food rewards. Females were categorized based on their estrous cycle stage on the first day of Pavlovian conditioning. A single exposure to stress enhanced conditioned responding in non-estrus females but suppressed conditioned responding in estrus females. Therefore, a single stress experience produced opposing effects on cue-driven behavior depending upon the estrous cycle stage. In contrast, both estrus and non-estrus rats exposed to repeated prior stress exhibited an increase in conditioned responding relative to animals that underwent a single stress exposure. We further examined if the distal stress experience subsequently impacted extinction and the ability to learn a new cue-reward association. Prior stress did not affect extinction, though estrus and non-estrus rats exposed to repeated prior stress exhibited higher levels of conditioned responding to the novel cue-reward pairing. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the influence of stress on reward learning is impacted acutely by the estrous cycle as well as by prior history with stress.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

In this work, we introduce a novel multi-resolution framework for analyzing temporal sequences of Symmetric Positive Semi-Definite (SPSD) matrices, such as correlation matrices. Our method constructs a hierarchical representation by recursively applying similarity and difference operators, respecting the underlying Riemannian geometry of the SPSD manifold. We further employ spectral analysis to identify subgroups that drive correlational dynamics. By extracting these key sub-networks, we denoise the signal and, importantly, promote the interpretability of time-varying systems. We validate our approach using both synthetic data and real neural recordings across modalities, including Calcium imaging and EEG, and at different scales, from local dendritic networks to cortical-level networks.

In ALS and FTD, TDP-43 mislocalises to the cytoplasm and forms insoluble, hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated aggregates that enhance cytotoxicity and contribute to neurodegeneration. Despite its primary role as an RNA/DNA-binding protein, how RNA-binding deficiencies contribute to disease onset and progression is little understood. Among many identified familial mutations in TDP-43 causing ALS/FTD, only two mutations cause an RNA-binding deficiency, K181E and K263E. In this study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock-in the two disease-linked RNA-binding deficient mutations in SH-SY5Y cells, generating both homozygous and heterozygous versions of the mutant TDP-43 to investigate TDP-43-mediated neuronal disruption. Significant changes were identified in the transcriptomic profiles of these cells, in particular, between K181E homozygous and heterozygous cells, with the most affected genes involved in neuronal differentiation and synaptic pathways. This result was validated in cell studies where the neuronal differentiation efficiency and neurite morphology were compromised in TDP-43 cells compared to unmodified control. Interestingly, divergent neuronal regulation was observed in K181E-TDP-43 homozygous and heterozygous cells, suggesting a more complex signalling network associated with TDP-43 genotypes and expression level which warrants further study. Overall, our data using cell models expressing the ALS/FTD disease-causing RNA-binding deficient TDP-43 mutations at endogenous levels show a robust impact on transcriptomic profiles at the whole gene and transcript isoform level that compromise neuronal differentiation and processing, providing further insights on TDP-43-mediated neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing scRNA seq on tumors from 41 glioma patients undergoing IL13Ra2-targeted CAR T cell therapy, identifying elevated suppressive SPP1 signatures predominantly in macrophages from patients who were resistant to treatment. Further integrative scRNA seq analysis of high-grade gliomas as well as an interferon-signaling deficient syngeneic mouse model both resistant to CAR T therapy demonstrated the role of congruent suppressive pathways in mediating resistance to CAR T cells and a dominant role for SPP1+ macrophages. SPP1 blockade with an anti-SPP1 antibody abrogates the suppressive TME effects and substantially prolongs survival in IFN signaling-deficient and glioma syngeneic mouse models resistant to CAR T cell therapy. These findings illuminate the role of SPP1+ macrophages in fueling a suppressive TME and driving solid tumor resistance to CAR cell therapies. Targeting SPP1 may serve as a universal strategy to reprogram immune dynamics in solid tumors mitigating resistance to CAR T therapies.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

LLM embeddings were used to predict brain responses to attended and unattended speech streams. Results show that LLMs reliably predict brain activity for the attended stream, and notably, contextual features from the unattended stream also contribute to prediction. Importantly, the brain appears to track shorter-range context in the unattended stream compared to the attended one. These findings reveal that the brain processes multiple speech streams in parallel, modulated by attention, and that LLMs can be valuable tools for probing neural language encoding in complex auditory settings.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

How the structure of connectivity shapes the emergent activity remains however not fully understood. We investigate this question in recurrent neural networks with additive stochastic inputs. We assume that the synaptic connectivity can be expressed in a low-rank form, parameterized by a handful of connectivity vectors, and examine how the geometry of emergent activity relates to these vectors. Our findings reveal that this relationship critically depends on the dimensionality of the external stochastic inputs. When inputs are low-dimensional, activity remains low-dimensional, and recurrent dynamics influence it within a subspace spanned by a subset of the connectivity vectors, with dimensionality equal to the rank of the connectivity matrix. In contrast, when inputs are high-dimensional, activity also becomes potentially high-dimensional. The contribution of recurrent dynamics lays within a subspace spanned by the totality of the connectivity vectors, with dimensionality equal to twice the rank of the connectivity matrix. Applying our formalism to excitatory-inhibitory networks, we discuss how the input configuration also plays a crucial role in determining the amount of amplification generated by non-normal dynamics. Our work provides a foundation for studying activity in structured brain circuits under realistic noise conditions, and offers a framework for interpreting stochastic models inferred from experimental data.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

By measuring thresholds for stimuli of different sizes, we can characterise the summation \"rule\" that links these two factors, providing insight into how contrast signals are integrated over space. Previous work has shown a linear summation rule over short distances, consistent with integration within the receptive fields of early cortical neurons. Beyond this range, the benefit of summation is reduced. We investigated whether the same summation rule held in peripheral vision as in the fovea. We measured thresholds for detecting \"tiger tail\" strips of grating (that grow orthogonal to the major axis of those presumed early receptive fields) in the fovea, parafovea (3 deg), and periphery (10.5 deg). The interpretation of previous studies has been complicated by the variation in local contrast sensitivity across the visual field. In our study, we have mapped a detailed \"Witch Hat\" attenuation surface of this inhomogeneity for each participant. This was used both as a component in our summation model, and to generate \"compensated\" stimuli where the local stimulus contrast was amplified by the reciprocal of the local sensitivity. Our results follow a common fourth root summation rule in the fovea, parafovea, and periphery, which we explain by a \"noisy energy\" model that combines: i) the Witch Hat surface, ii) linear filtering by early receptive fields, iii) square-law contrast transduction, and iv) the application of an internal template that devotes the participant's attention to the extent of the stimulus. Fitting this model with one global sensitivity parameter (per participant) accounts for the foveal and parafoveal data (56 thresholds), with one further parameter allowing us to also model the periphery (84 thresholds).", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

We introduce an empirical model that combines fractional Brownian motion with an inverse Gaussian distribution of diffusivities to describe the observed non-Gaussianity. Validated through Monte Carlo simulations, this model allows us to estimate the fractional diffusivity and exponent effectively. By altering macromolecular composition, the addition of energy, and assembly of a cytoskeleton, we identify three independent mechanisms that result in similar fractional exponents yet distinct diffusivities. We find that energy addition leads to non-stationary dynamics, in contrast to the stationary behavior observed under passive conditions. Presence of microtubules introduces a secondary dynamical timescale, which we describe using a two-state fractional Brownian motion model to differentiate between cytosolic and microtubule network associated contributions.

The factors which account for this pattern of degeneration are unclear, as AD risk genes are numerous and often broadly expressed. Previously, we generated a model of AD using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in which the AD risk variant of apolipoprotein E, APOE4, is pan-neuronally expressed. We showed that HSN class motor neurons degenerate in early adult stage animals. Here, we expand on our past work by performing behavioral analyses to deduce the effect of APOE4 on the function of distinct neuronal circuits. We found evidence that APOE4 induces dysfunction of other neurons; this spatiotemporal pattern of degeneration roughly correlates with endogenous levels of PTL-1, the C. elegans homolog of human MAPT also known as tau. Moreover, deletion of ptl-1 suppressed defects in multiple behaviors, suggesting broad protective effects across the nervous system including the HSN neurons. Lastly, we show that PTL-1 in the touch receptor neurons, where PTL-1 is most abundant, is required non-cell autonomously for degeneration of the HSN neurons.

To address this gap, we used the mustard-feeding drosophilid fly Scaptomyza flava, which feeds on toxic Brassicales plants like wasabi that produce noxious, electrophilic isothiocyanates (ITCs or mustard oils). We found that S. flava exhibits dramatically reduced behavioral sensitivity to allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) compared to its microbe-feeding relatives Scaptomyza pallida and Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesized that molecular evolution of the \"wasabi receptor\" TRPA1, known to perceive ITCs in flies, could explain this loss of aversion. Our experiments revealed three interconnected evolutionary genetic changes consistent with this hypothesis. First, TRPA1 was expressed in labellar tissues of S. flava at the lowest levels among the three species, at a nearly four-fold lower level than in D. melanogaster. Second, S. flava expressed a higher proportion of TRPA1 splice variants previously reported to be less sensitive to chemical stimulus. Third, we identified amino acid substitutions in S. flava that could influence the structure of intracellular domains of TRPA1. To test the functional salience of these mechanisms in vitro and in vivo, we validated TRPA1 splicing isoforms using Xenopus oocyte electrophysiology and the GAL4/UAS system in D. melanogaster. Single isoform electrophysiology indeed revealed evolution of TRPA1 in the S. flava lineage towards reduced electrophile sensitivity. Ectopic expression of S. flava TRPA1 in D. melanogaster consistently conferred weaker AITC sensitivity in vivo than expression of its orthologues, although this did not fully recapitulate differences in wild-type phenotypes between the species suggesting other molecular evolutionary mechanisms were involved. Finally, we explored the consequences of isoform co-expression using oocyte electrophysiology. We found that enrichment of electrophile-insensitive TRPA1 splicing isoforms as observed in S. flava can additively reduce cellular responses to AITC, which could further contribute to reduced electrophile aversion. Our findings illuminate how expression differences, protein structural changes, and especially alternative splicing, together can drive sensory evolution as animals behaviorally adapt to toxic new niches.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

The corrosion incorporates two pathways, i.e., chemical and biological oxidation of H2S to sulfuric acid; however, their rates are difficult to differentiate on corroded sewer pipelines, limiting understanding and application of effective strategies for corrosion control. Here, this study develops and reports a kinetic approach to determining rates of chemical and biological sulfide oxidation. By measuring the total sulfide uptake rate of sewer corrosion concretes, extensive experimental data was obtained for calibration and validation of the proposed kinetic model. The modelling results fit with measured data indicating that both chemical and biological sulfide oxidation can be well-described by the developed model. Model predictions revealed that along with sewer corrosion (i.e., pH decrease), chemical sulfide oxidation rate was significantly accelerated, along with an increase in biological rate. This result suggests that the chemical sulfide oxidation process should not be overlooked for seriously corroded concretes, and synergistic strategies to suppress both biological and chemical rates are required.

This phenomenon, termed fungal morphogenesis, is critical for fungi to survive and colonize diverse ecological niches and establish infections in a variety of hosts. Despite significant advancements in the field with respect to understanding the gene regulatory networks that control these transitions, the metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we uncover a previously uncharacterized, conserved dependency between central carbon metabolism and de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids that is critical for fungal morphogenesis, in two key fungal species. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that glycolytic flux is crucial to drive fungal morphogenesis and perturbation of this pathway leads to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Remarkably, exogenous supplementation of sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine/methionine) or inorganic sulfate, robustly rescues the morphogenesis defect induced by the perturbation of glycolysis in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, underscoring the pivotal role of de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acid as a downstream effector of morphogenesis. Furthermore, a C. albicans mutant lacking the glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase (Pfk1) exhibited significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis.

Parkinson's disease participants and controls were presented with tactile stimuli in non-jittered or jittered sequences, with the last on-time position of the sequence being omitted to probe prediction-related processes. We find prediction-related differences in the cerebellum and the basal ganglia before the omissions, but no differences in cerebellar evaluation responses after the omissions. In Parkinson's disease participants, basal ganglia activity favors jittered sequences over non-jittered, whereas the reverse is seen in the controls.

Sex-specific recombination maps showed higher recombination in males than females for both breeds (Alpine autosomal map size = 35.1M in males and 30.5M in females; Saanen map size = 34.0M in males and 29.0M in females). Heterochiasmy is particularly notable on small chromosomes, and at both ends of the chromosomes. Yet, no difference in shuffling has been found between populations.

We determine degron potency of >200,000 different 30-residue tiles from more than 5,000 cytosolic human proteins with 99.7% coverage. In total, 19.1% of the tiles function as strong degrons, 30.4% as intermediate degrons, while 50.5% did not display degron properties. The vast majority of the degrons are dependent on the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme and the proteasome but independent of autophagy. The results reveal both known and novel degron motifs, both internal as well as at the C-terminus. Mapping the degrons onto protein structures, predicted by AlphaFold2, revealed that most of the degrons are located in buried regions, indicating that they only become active upon unfolding or misfolding. Training of a machine learning model allowed us to probe the degron properties further and predict the cellular abundance of missense variants that operate by forming degrons in exposed and disordered protein regions, thus providing a mechanism of pathogenicity for germline coding variants at such positions.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

However, in a dynamic biological process such as cell differentiation, we lack an understanding of how the transcriptional activity of CREs progressively change and what sequence features underlie these transitions, which may reflect common and/or coordinated regulatory processes. Here, we use single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq to follow, at a genome scale, CREs along differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into cortical neurons and develop a method to automatically identify the diversity of CRE profiles and their underlying sequence features. We propose a machine-learning guided clustering algorithm, STOIC (Statistical learning TO Inform Clustering), that jointly learns an unsupervised clustering of the CREs in the space of the activity profiles and a supervised predictor associated with each cluster in the DNA-sequence space. This procedure explores the expression space and delineates the CRE clusters iteratively in order to optimize the performance of a supervised classifier predicting CRE cluster membership based on DNA sequence features. STOIC is specifically designed to provide readily interpretable results. We show that the method identifies CRE profiles associated with highly predictive sequence features and outperforms methods solely concerned with co-activity clustering on this task. Orthogonal data collected in the same settings link the inferred CRE clusters to specific enhancer or promoter signatures. Furthermore, we show that the DNA features unveiled by STOIC reflect biologically relevant regulators and offer a valuable basis to dissect elements of the cis-regulatory grammar.

A.; Shrimpton, A.; Shirts, M. R.; Hough, L. E.", "abstract": "Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is one mechanism that cells can use to organize biomolecules spatially and functionally. Some coiled-coil (CC) proteins, such as the centrosomal proteins pericentrin and spd-5, are thought to LLPS, but it is currently unknown what parts of these proteins facilitate the process. It is thought, however, that the numerous CC domains in these proteins might be contributing to their LLPS. We recently showed, using computational studies and designed proteins, that CC domains can facilitate LLPS through specific interactions between the CC domains themselves, meaning that each CC was designed to interact only with a subset of other CCs in the system. This is in contrast to nonspecific interactions, where all CCs would be able to interact with all other CCs in the system, which is akin to some interactions (e.g. {pi}--{pi}) seen in phase-separating intrinsically disordered proteins. Because the specificity of interactions between natural CC domains is tunable in a sequence-dependent fashion, CC domains present a unique system that allows us to investigate the contributions of specific versus nonspecific interactions on LLPS. We show, in our computational system, that CC proteins with nonspecific interactions can LLPS but with less propensity compared to specific interactions. The LLPS propensity of CC proteins with nonspecific interactions can be improved by altering the structure and dynamics of linker segments, without directly changing the specificity of interactions. We also demonstrate that the number of intra-chain CC contacts plays a direct role in determining LLPS for nonspecifically interacting proteins. These results have broad implications for the role of linker segments---protein features beyond the interaction domains e.g. 'stickers'---in protein LLPS and the formation of biomolecular condensates.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Translation control, regulated by eIF2 dephosphorylation, is essential for Plasmodium development during infection. The parasite phosphatase UIS2 regulates this modification. However, the structural basis for UIS2 substrate recognition remains unknown. Here, we show that UIS2 is crucial for parasite development in both liver and blood stages. Its N-terminal and phosphatase domains each independently bind the eIF2 phosphoserine-59 loop through electrostatic interactions. Integrated structural modeling, using AlphaFold and molecular dynamics simulations, reveals a defined binding pocket within the phosphatase domain, with a geometry distinct from human PP1. This pocket contains six cooperative binding patches that use an electrostatic network to stabilize the phosphopeptide near the active site and contribute to substrate specificity. Metadynamics simulations show that the inhibitor Salubrinal competes with the phosphopeptide for binding to this pocket. Molecular docking and free energy perturbation analyses show that Salubrinal targets three of these binding patches through hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions, blocking substrate binding. These findings show the structural and energetic basis of eIF2 dephosphorylation by UIS2.

To do this, we used the Sternberg Task of working memory, in which the participant plays repeated trials where they are shown different sets of numbers and then asked to identify whether probe number was in the set or not. The Sternberg Task is ideal for testing the two hypotheses by looking at pain-related changes in accuracy and response time. There was a replication of the response time increase with set size, as well as the effect of older age on working memory and pain threshold. However, we saw no pain effect on either response time, accuracy, or the relationship between these parameters and set size with either chronic pain or an acute painful thermal stimulus.

However, when this coordination is established each time animals vocalize remains poorly understood. Here, we addressed this question by recording respiratory pressure in adult, male, zebra finches during singing. Zebra finches begin their song bouts by repeating a short vocalization called an introductory note (IN), before producing song and these INs have been hypothesized to reflect motor preparation for song. We found that each IN is associated with a large amplitude expiratory pulse. Birds that did not produce INs had a few silent, large amplitude, IN-like, expiratory pulses just before starting song. Expiratory pressure and inspiratory pressure increased with successive repeats of the IN (silent or vocalized). Further, for birds with INs, coordination between respiration and vocalization increased with vocalizations beginning earlier in the exhalation and ending later in the exhalation, such that more of the expiratory pulse was filled with the vocalizaton. Overall, these results show that respiratory vocal coordination improves with each repetition of the IN and suggest that INs reflect preparation that involves coordination of respiratory and vocal neural circuitry.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

However, for most CAR T targets it is observed that low surface antigen density on tumors can significantly reduce therapeutic efficacy. Here, we explore this dynamic in the context of CD72, a surface antigen we recently found as a promising target for refractory B-cell cancers, but for which CD72 low antigen density can lead to therapeutic resistance in preclinical models. Methods: Primary samples were accessed via institutional review board-approved protocols. Affinity-matured and humanized nanobody clones were previously described in Temple et al.1 CAR T-cells were generated via lentiviral transduction. In vitro cytotoxicity assays were performed using luciferase-labeled cell lines. In vivo studies were performed using cell line- or patient-derived xenografts implanted in NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. Results: We first confirmed ubiquitous CD72 expression across a range of primary B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. We further found that after resistance to CD19-directed therapies, across both B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) models and primary tumor samples, surface CD72 expression was largely preserved while CD22 expression was significantly diminished. Affinity maturation of a nanobody targeting CD72, when incorporated into chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells, led to more effective elimination in vitro of isogenic models of CD72 low-expressing tumors. These results suggested that nanobody-based CAR T-cells (nanoCARs) may exhibit a similar relationship between binder affinity, antigen expression, and efficacy as previously demonstrated only for scFv-based CAR T-cells. Surprisingly, however, this significantly improved in vitro efficacy only translated to modest in vivo survival benefit. As a parallel strategy to enhance CAR T function, we found that the small molecule bryostatin could also significantly increase CD72 surface antigen density on B-cell malignancy models. Structural modeling and biochemical analysis identified critical residues improving CD72 antigen recognition of our lead affinity-matured nanobody. Conclusions: Together, these findings support affinity-matured CD72 nanoCARs as a potential immunotherapy product for CD19-refractory B-cell cancers. Our results also suggest that for B-ALL in particular, CD72 may be a preferable second-line immunotherapy target over CD22.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Unlike limb development, the anterior craniofacial skeleton arises from cranial neural crest (cNCC) stem cells. To examine the temporal activation of SOX9 and RUNX2 within cNCCs, we utilized a combination of immunofluorescence to detect endogenous proteins and genetic reporters to label SOX9 and RUNX2 expressing cells. We find that RUNX2 is expressed broadly throughout cNCC stem cells of the first branchial arch that will give rise to developing mandibular tissue at a timepoint prior to osteochondral lineage determination. Substantial SOX9 expression is activated subsequently within differentiating chondrocytes. These findings were validated by fluorescent reporters inserted in the 3 prime untranslated regions (UTRs) of Sox9 and Runx2. Although the GFP based Runx2 reporter did not delete any 3 prime UTR sequences, homozygous Runx2-GFP/GFP pups develop postnatal deficiencies in intramembranous and endochondral ossification that correlate with enhanced expression of RUNX2 protein in osteoblasts and hypertrophic chondrocytes.

Herein, we report an AMPK PHICS platform that operates under physiological conditions (i.e., no serum starvation or target overexpression), recruits multiple AMPK complexes, and can induce target protein phosphorylation with dose and temporal control. We demonstrated the utility of this platform for controlling phosphorylations that underlie two dynamic cellular processes, namely oncogenic signaling and phase separation.

Induced-proximity modalities, an emergent class of therapeutics, target protein-of-interest (POI) activity by forming a ternary complex with target and effector proteins, unlike classical inhibitors that form binary complexes. Using KRAS as a model system, we employed base editor tiling mutagenesis screening to show that induced-proximity inhibitors (e.g., molecular glues) exhibit orthogonal resistance mechanisms to classical inhibitors despite overlapping binding sites, offering an opportunity to circumvent resistance mechanisms of classical inhibitors. These findings highlight the use of base editor mutagenesis screens to prioritize inhibitors with orthogonal resistance mechanisms and the potential of induced-proximity inhibitors to overcome the drug resistance of classical inhibitors.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

To explore the interplay between these factors in controlling the dynamics at the tissue scale, we created a minimal three dimensional model in which short-range repulsive elastic forces account for cell-cell interactions. Self-propulsion is modeled as active uncor- related random stochastic forces, with strength , that act on individual cells and is the only source of cell motility. Strikingly, variations in polydispersity in cell sizes ({Sigma}) and cell elasticity (E), results in the formation of a variety of distinct ''phases'', driven entirely by . At low E, the tissue behaves like a liquid, at all values of {Sigma}, whereas at high E and {Sigma}, it has the characteristics of a glass. The tissue crystallizes at low {Sigma} provided E exceeds a critical value. Over a narrow range of E and {Sigma}, that lies between the boundaries of the liquid and glass phase, the effective viscosity increases like in a glass as the cell density increases and saturates as the cells are compressed beyond a certain value, creating the viscosity saturation (VS) phase. The VS phase does not form in systems at finite temperature in which the dynamics satisfies the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem. In the glass phase, the tissue exhibits aging (relaxation times depend on the waiting time) behavior at high E values. Our findings provide a framework for designing tissues with tunable material properties by controlling the physical characteristics of cells.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Yet dissecting this context dependency remains challenging because we lack methods for tracking nutrients such as carbon (C) and phosphorus (P). Here, we developed a new approach to quantitatively estimate C and P fluxes in the AM symbiosis from comprehensive network morphology quantification, achieved by robotic imaging and machine learning based on roughly 100 million hyphal shape measurements. We found that rates of C transfer from the plant and P transfer from the fungus were, on average, related proportionally to one another. This ratio was nearly invariant across AM fungal strains despite contrasting growth phenotypes, but was strongly affected by plant host genotype. Fungal phenotype distributions were bounded by a Pareto front with a shape favoring specialization in an exploration-exploitation trade-off. This means AM fungi can be fast range expanders or fast resource extractors, but not both. Manipulating the C/P exchange rate by swapping the plant host genotype shifted this Pareto front, indicating that the exchange rate constrains possible AM fungal growth strategies. We show by mathematical modeling how AM fungal growth at fixed exchange rate leads to qualitatively different symbiotic outcomes depending on fungal traits and nutrient availability.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Phytochrome A (phyA) is essential for seedling adaptation to deep shade, yet its role under moderate natural canopy conditions remains unclear. By expressing a novel phyA-nanoLUC reporter in Arabidopsis thaliana, we quantify diurnal fluctuations in phyA and its induction by low red to far-red (R:FR) ratio, simulating canopy shade. We uncover a new key regulatory function for phyB, which increases phyA stability post-dawn in unshaded conditions and modulates expression of PHYA in low R:FR. Further, we demonstrate that beyond its role as a deep shade sensor, phyA is an adept sensor of canopy shade, capable of detecting a range of R:FR ratios across light intensities. Mathematical modelling demonstrates that this property arises from the dynamic features of the phyA HIR mode of action. Interestingly, phyA synthesis is strongly induced by subtle reductions in R:FR ratio, and is robust to light perturbation, suggesting the phyA-sensory module is configured to detect modest shade. Spectral data from natural shade habitats provides ecological context for our laboratory findings. Physiological analysis indicates that under canopy shade phyA promotes seedling de-etiolation, organises resource management and accelerates reproductive development. We propose that this suite of responses, termed the canopy adaptation strategy, enhances survival chances under conditions where shade-avoidance strategies are maladaptive.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

In plant research, unique challenges arise from the complexity of plant tissues, interference of secondary metabolites, and sometimes the low abundance of target proteins. Many conventional plant protein purification methods rely on expensive reagents, multi-step procedures, and labor-intensive workflows, limiting their feasibility for many applications. Here, we present the Catch & Release system, a cost-effective, fast and reliable one-step purification workflow for the isolation of soluble and membrane-bound proteins from plant tissues. The Catch & Release toolbox includes a vector set, a homemade GFP-trap and homemade proteases. Catch & Release vectors streamline cloning and transgenic plant selection through the Fluorescence-Accumulating Seed Technology (FAST), which marks positive transformants with a strongly fluorescing seed coat. Each plasmid consists of four, easy to exchange, modules: a plant promoter, a cloning dropout marker, protease cleavage sites, and seven different epitope tags, including an innovative dual-fluorescent tag, providing flexibility for diverse experimental needs. The in vivo functionality of all modules has been confirmed. Besides enabling standard molecular biological experimentation, our vector set in combination with homemade GFP-trap and proteases enables efficient and rapid isolation of soluble and high molecular weight membrane proteins directly from plants.

We show that a natural accession of pennycress, 2032, is more susceptible to the necrotrophic fungal pathogens Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Alternaria japonica than the reference pennycress accession MN106. A previously identified marker associated with early flowering and maturity in pennycress was found to be present in a gene homologous to Arabidopsis Jumonji 14 (JMJ14). It has been reported that AtJMJ14 promotes disease resistance and represses flowering, and greenhouse studies of breeding populations confirmed this phenomenon in pennycress. Plants with the 2032 TaJMJ14 allele were more susceptible to fungi and flowered early. CRISPR-Cas9 editing was used to generate additional TaJMJ14 alleles. A 9-base pair deletion in the 6th exon of TaJMJ14 showed trends of early flowering and S. sclerotiorum susceptibility, whereas a complete loss-of-function allele led to infertility. We further investigated the transcriptomes of MN106 and 2032 plants in the early stages of S. sclerotiorum and A. japonica infection to identify potential resistance and susceptibility genes. Differences in the expression of pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI)-associated genes led us to discover that 2032 plants have defects in elicitor-triggered oxidative bursts. The transcriptional responses unique to each accession lay a foundation for future gene-editing and breeding approaches to keep the beneficial early flowering phenotype conferred by 2032 but uncouple it from disease susceptibility.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we aimed to identify the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) genes responsible for PM resistance within Ren6 and Ren7. To do so, we assembled diploid telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genomes of V. piasezkii DVIT2027 and V. vinifera F2-35, the resistant and susceptible parents, respectively, of a segregating F1 population. We then integrated these assemblies with deep resequencing data from eight F1 sib-lines carrying different combinations of Ren6 and Ren7, and generated trio-binned, parent-phased genomes for six of them. This allowed us to resolve and phase the Ren6 and Ren7 loci and their PM-susceptible alternative haplotypes. Comparative analyses revealed extensive structural variation, particularly duplications, and numerous short polymorphisms between resistant and susceptible haplotypes, leading to complete sequence specificity among all NLRs in Ren6 and Ren7, with several lacking allelic counterparts in their respective susceptible haplotypes. Expression profiling across PM-resistant sib-lines identified four and two candidate CC-NBS-LRR genes associated with Ren6 and Ren7, respectively, based on both expression and haplotype specificity. These results provide a high-resolution view of two key PM resistance loci and support the identification of candidate resistance genes for functional validation and targeted grapevine breeding.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

We used both single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing to capture gene expression profiles from individual leaf cells, enabling detailed comparison of cell types and transcriptional signatures. Both approaches produced biologically comparable data for major leaf cell types, transcriptomes from single-nucleus sequencing showed lower stress signatures and were more representative of tissue proportions in the leaf.

On the other hand, mathematical models, such as Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GEMs), offer a structured framework for analyzing the organization and dynamics of specific cellular mechanisms.

We test its performances against pure ML and parsimonious Flux Balance Analysis (pFBA), demonstrating its efficacy in improving prediction performances.

We generated thousands of object images using computer graphics, varying lighting, shapes, and viewpoints, and experimentally measured perceived glossiness for each image. Observers showed curious patterns of agreement and disagreement with the physical reflectance in their gloss estimates, yet their judgments remained highly consistent both within and across individuals. We then compared two sets of neural networks: one set trained to mimic the human responses (human-like networks) and another trained on physical labels to approximate physical reality (ground-truth networks). We progressively reduced the size of the networks to identify the minimum computations capable of meeting the two objective functions. While quite deep networks were required to estimate physical reflectance, we found that surprisingly shallow networks, with as few as three convolutional layers, could accurately replicate human gloss judgments. Indeed, even a miniscule network with just a single filter could predict human judgments better than the best ground-truth network. The human-like networks also successfully predicted some known perceptual gloss effects beyond the training range. Our findings suggest that humans do not judge material properties through complex computations such as inverse optics; instead, gloss perception arises from simpler computations useful for other visual tasks.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the effects of D-amphetamine using our previously published approach where electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings from eight cortical areas provided a coarse estimation of the global activity distribution patterns across sets of neuron populations. Changes in these activity distribution patterns were quantified with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification. We found that D-amphetamine significantly altered the activity distribution patterns both for spontaneous activity and for activity recorded during ongoing tactile stimulation. It also reduced the difference between spontaneous activity and activity during ongoing tactile stimulation, which suggests that amphetamine reduced the organization in the network activity and could potentially explain hallucinations under the influence of amphetamine. Each of these changes were distributed approximately evenly across each dimension of the principal component space. This indicates that amphetamine impacts cortical network dynamics broadly and in multifaceted ways, compatible with the system-wide presence of the receptors that amphetamine interferes with. Our data indicates that relatively low doses of D-amphetamine can induce changes in brain activity distributions that are measurable potentially also by non-invasive EEG electrodes.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

We hypothesize that individual differences in music recall are influenced by interoceptive accuracy. To test this, we conducted an electroencephalogram (EEG) experiment where participants listened to and recalled both familiar and unfamiliar music. The interoceptive accuracy of participants was assessed through a heartbeat counting task. We observed greater alpha power suppression during recall periods in familiar music than in unfamiliar music. Furthermore, participants with higher interoceptive accuracy exhibited stronger alpha power suppression during music recall. These findings suggest that music recall involves interoceptive attention.

Leveraging a priori knowledge of bona fide neoantigens, we combined high-intensity neoantigen stimulation with bead extraction of neoantigen peptide-pulsed target cells to enable the enrichment of NeoPBL to frequencies comparable to ex vivo cultured TIL over a 28-day period. Throughout this process, NeoPBL demonstrate specific reactivity against autologous tumor organoids and maintain memory-like features, including elevated expression of CD28 and TCF7. We additionally demonstrate that NeoPBL reactivity is polyclonal, encompassing multiple clonotypes that are detectable within in vivo TIL populations, underscoring physiological specificity for the targeted neoantigens. This streamlined process yields clinically relevant cell doses and enables identification and expansion of blood-derived neoantigen-specific TCRs. By potentially avoiding additional surgical risks and protracted delays of TIL and individualized TCR-engineered methods, the NeoPBL platform may have clinical and practical advantages.

Rather, there is increasing evidence for survival of trees also in isolated patches further north, termed 'northern refugia'. While their existence is undisputed, based on what is known from a handful of tree species, there is very limited knowledge about forest understoreys. Here, we fill this gap by examining the evolutionary histories of three Central European forest understorey species (FUS; Aposeris foetida, Cardamine trifolia, Hacquetia epipactis). To do so, we use a set of exploratory and explicit analyses utilizing genomic data and ecological niche models, and interpret these data following an a priori defined framework. We identify the northwestern Balkan Peninsula as the primary diversification center for the three species but found additional northern refugia in the Alps, the Carpathians, and the Apennines. Divergence times indicated pre-Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) diversification within each FUS, suggesting persistence of forest islands in Central Europe during Pleistocene cold stages rather than exclusively post-LGM colonization.

The ecological importance of these mutualistic interactions has sparked interest in their long evolutionary history. By examining interaction networks and phylogenetic trees, several studies have suggested that plants codiversify or cospeciate with their associated mycorrhizal fungi. However, recent research has demonstrated that phylogenetic congruence (often interpreted as codiversification) has often been conflated with another pattern called cophylogenetic signal (i.e., closely related plants interacting with closely related fungi), which arises from different biological processes. We performed cophylogenetic analyses on 29 diverse mycorrhizal networks to reevaluate the evidence for codiversification in mycorrhizal symbioses. We found significant cophylogenetic signal but no phylogenetic congruence: closely related plants interact with closely related fungi, but their phylogenies do not match. Instead of codiversification, this finding suggests that plants and fungi undergo diffuse coevolution, likely driven by trait-matching, where compatible, evolutionarily conserved plant and fungal traits govern their interactions. Our work highlights the importance of appropriately interpreting the cophylogenetic methods used to study the macroevolution of plants and their mycorrhizal fungi. It suggests that previous studies proposing codiversification in mycorrhizal symbioses actually detected cophylogenetic signal, indicating that there is no evidence of codiversification or cospeciation occurring during the evolution of mycorrhizal symbioses.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Sex and age-associated differences in methylation were non-randomly distributed with respect to proximity to putative sex hormone receptor binding sites, with sites hypermethylated in males and females tending to be underrepresented near androgen and estrogen receptor binding sites, respectively. Across species, we observed the relative steepness of male versus female slopes of age-associated variation was associated with the strength of precopulatory sexual selection, with especially strong trends towards male-biased age-associated slopes in two harem-polygynous species that exhibit female-biased longevity. Our results offer insights into how patterns of methylation differ across sexes and ages, and raise intriguing questions for future research, such as whether sex differences in molecular aging reflect sex-biased longevity, for which records in bats are sparse.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Loss of function mutation of MeCP2 which impairs its DNA binding ability causes Rett syndrome, while gain of MeCP2 function causes MeCP2 duplication syndrome. In the context of gene regulation, MeCP2 act as both transcription activator and repressor. Despite over three decades of MeCP2 discovery, the function of this enigmatic protein is largely unknown. Recent study on MeCP2 reported that, in addition to binding DNA, its MBD domain also binds to methylated lysine residues on histone H3 tail. Here we aimed to characterize the methyllysine binding pocket of MeCP2-MBD. Our analysis of MeCP2-MBD crystal structure reveals the presence of an aromatic cage formed by five residues, namely, W104, F132, Y141, F142, and F155, where the trimethyllysine of H3K27me3 binds, as confirmed in docking studies. Mutation of the aforementioned aromatic residues to alanine abolished binding of MeCP2-MBD with its reported ligand H3K27me3 in ITC and pull-down experiments. Additionally, our genomic analysis of publicly available ChIP-seq data revealed that MeCP2 localizes with canonical histone methylation marks like H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H4K20me3 in the genome and regulate critical biological and cancer related pathways. Promoters of MeCP2 regulated genes, show signature of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. In the genomic level, mutation of aromatic cage residue W104A, significantly reduced chromatin occupancy of MeCP2 as demonstrated by ChIP-qPCR experiments. Overall, our study establishes MeCP2 as a histone methylation reader and its histone binding ability is critical for MeCP2 to tether into chromatin.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Over time, human GPC-4 (hGPC4) has gained recognition as a valuable target for enhancing the therapeutic potential of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). hGPC-4 is also a promising diagnostic and therapeutic target for a range of developmental and neurological disorders, as well as cancer. Its involvement in multiple biological processes and its impact on cellular signaling pathways make it a compelling candidate for future research and clinical applications. Here, we report RB1 and RB3 as the first hGPC-4-specific nanobodies, exhibiting high affinity for both recombinant and cell surface-associated hGPC-4 molecules. Notably, the bivalent nanobody Fc-fusion form of RB1, termed RB1-Fc, demonstrates a significant ~14-fold increase in apparent binding affinity on cells when compared to the monovalent RB1. Furthermore, binding of RB1-Fc to hGPC-4 is dependent on the native conformation of hGPC-4, demonstrating that RB1-Fc is a conformational nanobody. Notably, RB1-Fc neutralizes the activity of GPC-4, as shown by our functional studies in hPSCs. These studies demonstrate the potent efficacy of the lead hGPC4 nanobodies, RB1-Fc and RB3. They also provide a solid rationale for using these nanobodies in the detection and characterization of physiologically and clinically relevant hGPC-4.

Some remain in a proliferative state, forming tight clusters; others detach and elongate into an invasive state; and some retain a rounded amoeboid form with minimal matrix adhesion. However, factors that determine which morphological state a cell adopts remain poorly understood. Using a combined theoretical and experimental framework, we showed that extracellular matrix (ECM) mechanics regulate cancer cell morphology in three-dimensional (3D) environments. We developed a theoretical model based on the principle of minimum energy, which predicts that a cell will adopt the morphological state (rounded, elongated, or clustered) that minimizes the total energy of the cell-ECM system. Using MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, we established a reliable protocol for encapsulating cells into 3D naturally-derived hydrogels with controlled stiffness and pore size. We validated the model predictions in vitro over an extended culture period. In soft ECMs, cells transitioned over time to an elongated morphology, while in stiff ECMs, cells favored clustered configurations. These transitions were governed by the physical (not chemical) properties of the hydrogel-based ECM, as confirmed by using chemically distinct yet mechanically matched composite matrices. These new insights have implications for cancer invasion modeling and potential drug screening.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

It is defined by key structural features, including consecutive sheared AG base pairs, an A-minor interaction, and multiple base-sugar interactions. Accurate representation of these densely packed non-canonical motifs in molecular dynamics simulations poses a significant challenge for contemporary force fields (FFs). Here, we present extended simulations of ribosomal kink-turn 7 (Kt-7) using a broad spectrum of pair-additive and polarizable RNA FFs. None of the tested FFs manage to flawlessly describe all the specific structural features of the Kt-7, which are described in detail in this work. Still, several FFs provide rather acceptable results and should not cause problems in simulations of larger RNAs containing a kink-turn. On aggregate, the widely used OL3 (ff99bsc0chiOL3) and polarizable AMOEBA FFs achieve the best performance. On the other hand, some more recently parametrized FF variants struggle to describe the Kt-7's tertiary A-minor interaction - an ubiquitous tertiary contact in RNA. This raises some concerns about the broader applicability of these FFs and suggests that they may be overfitted to small RNA model systems, such as RNA tetranucleotides. The difficulties manifest as either reversible local disruptions of the A-minor interaction and other tertiary contacts or, in some cases, irreversible unkinking of the entire motif. Based on our findings, we strongly suggest including the kink-turn motif in training and benchmarking datasets as the quintessential regression test to enhance the robustness and accuracy of RNA FF parametrization efforts.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Here, NMR-based studies coupled with computational cheminformatics and cellular function are leveraged to identify a relationship between the human cold and menthol receptor TRPM8 dynamics, chemical structure, and cellular potency. TRPM8 is a validated target for a variety of pain indications but generally has been clinically limited by on-target side effects impacting thermosensing and thermoregulation. This study shows that cheminformatic analysis of a TRPM8 regulating small molecule ligand library correlates with cellular function. Electrophysiology studies further validate the relationship and show a correlation between chemical structure and functional features such as compound potency. Solution NMR studies of the TRPM8 voltage sensing-like domain, which houses the canonical menthol ligand binding site, show that ligand binding conformationally selects NMR-detected TRPM8 dynamics in a manner that quantitatively correlates with chemical structure. The relationship between chemical structure and protein dynamics can be used predictively, where a chemical structure is predictive of dynamics in a latent reduced dimensionality space. Moreover, the robustness of the conformational selection of the dynamic ensemble is evaluated by varying related and divergent chemotypes, signal-to-noise sensitivity, and sample bias.

The recently developed NMFF-AFM flexible fitting method provides a computationally efficient approach promising to infer atomistic-precision models of conformational dynamics from resolution-limited AFM imaging data. We report the software integration of this method into the well-established BioAFMviewer platform and demonstrate first applications to experimental HS-AFM imaging data.

The presented applications to experimental data of a single protein domain, a protein complex, and a megadalton size protein filament demonstrate versatility of NMFF-AFM modelling to reproduce large-amplitude conformational motions of biomolecular dynamics from HS-AFM imaging. As a first step towards automated large-scale analysis of AFM imaging data, we furthermore demonstrate reconstruction of an atomistic molecular movie of protein dynamics, involving large-amplitude conformational transitions, from a measured HS-AFM movie sequence.

G.; Phillips, R.", "abstract": "Genes are connected in complex networks of interactions where often the product of one gene is a transcription factor that alters the expression of another. Many of these networks are based on a few fundamental motifs leading to switches and oscillators of various kinds. And yet, there is more to the story than which transcription factors control these various circuits. These transcription factors are often themselves under the control of effector molecules that bind them and alter their level of activity. Traditionally, much beautiful work has shown how to think about the stability of the different states achieved by these fundamental regulatory architectures by examining how parameters such as transcription rates, degradation rates and dissociation constants tune the circuit, giving rise to behavior such as bistability. However, such studies explore dynamics without asking how these quantities are altered in real time in living cells as opposed to at the fingertips of the synthetic biologist's pipette or on the computational biologist's computer screen. In this paper, we make a departure from the conventional dynamical systems view of these regulatory motifs by using statistical mechanical models to focus on endogenous signaling knobs such as effector concentrations rather than on the convenient but more experimentally remote knobs such as dissociation constants, transcription rates and degradation rates that are often considered. We also contrast the traditional use of Hill functions to describe transcription factor binding with more detailed thermodynamic models. This approach provides insights into how biological parameters are tuned to control the stability of regulatory motifs in living cells, sometimes revealing quite a different picture than is found by using Hill functions and tuning circuit parameters by hand.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

We then created a novel, gene-specific, transcriptional aging clock, which demonstrated that sulforaphane-treated individuals exhibited a \"transcriptional age\" that was approximately four days younger than age-matched controls, representing a nearly 20% reduction in biological age. The clearest transcriptional responses were detoxification pathways, which, together with the shape of the dose-response curve, indicates a likely hormetic response to sulforaphane.

They are often referred to as \"mural\" cells because they are so frequently found on the exterior walls of small vessels - particularly the capillaries. In heart, high-resolution real-time observations and measurements of pericyte function under physiological conditions are challenging to obtain because of vascular motion, tissue depth and vigorous functional movement. For these reasons, the heart may be one of the most difficult tissues in which to examine pericyte function. Recently, we introduced a perfused papillary muscle preparation (the Z-Prep) that allows us to observe coronary arteries, arterioles, venules, capillaries and myocytes in real time at physiological temperature and pressure while also imaging pericytes 1, 2. Here we present an initial study intended to visualize and characterize quantitatively cardiac pericytes in heart at physiological pressure and temperature conditions. Vascular anatomy was imaged using a z-stack protocol with a rapidly spinning disk confocal microscope. Here the anatomical organization of the pericytes is shown at high resolution with respect to the microcirculation components and cardiac myocytes. The surprising findings include the high abundance of pericytes in native tissue, the extent of their spread on the capillaries themselves, and the existence of major pericyte extensions that travel intimately along the surface of neighboring ventricular myocytes and attach to capillaries on the distant side. These extensions arise from a capillary-based pericyte location and normally end on another capillary endothelial surface and we have named them \"bridging\" pericytes. Taken together this anatomical organization suggests that the pericytes provide signaling, communication and contractile services to important cellular components of the heart. There is also a provocative suggestion that pericytes in heart are unusually fragile since they suffer an extremely high degree of loss during cellular isolation procedures. However, our investigation of the organization argues against this fragility because of the durability of the dynamic pericyte organization and function despite the stress and brutality of the contracting heart. The work presented here lays the foundation for critical functional studies of pericytes in heart in both health and disease.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Proper regulation of the timing of phase transition in response to internal and external cues is crucial to optimize proliferation and reproduction. In Physcomitrium patens (P. patens), a moss, the transition from growth of filamentous tissue growth called protonema to gametophore bud formation represents a shift from two-dimensional (2D) to three-demensional (3D) growrh, ultimately leading to reproductive development. MORE AXILLARY GROWTH2 (MAX2), an F-box protein, targets repressor proteins in the KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2)-dependent signaling pathway for degradation via the 26S proteasome-dependent pathway. KAI2 perceives an unidentified ligand known as KAI2 ligand (KL) as well as karrikins. The four SMAX1-LIKE (SMXL) family proteins work as suppressors in the MAX2-dependent signaling in P. patens. Gametophore bud formation was accelerated when MAX2-dependent signaling was disrupted, while it was delayed in Ppsmxls, loss of function mutants of the PpSMXLs. These results indicate that MAX2-dependent signaling suppresses gametophore bud formation in P. patens, which has not been previously described. We demonstrate that cytokinin activity and contents are increased in Ppmax2 mutants, and cytokinin application rescued the delay in bud formation in Ppsmxl mutants, suggesting that MAX2-dependent signaling suppresses cytokinin accumulation. The four SMXL genes redundantly act to promote gametophore bud formation; PpSMXLC and PpSMXLD, which contain the conserved degron sequence, act as the repressor of MAX2-dependent signaling, while PpSMXLA and PpSMXLB function independent of proteolysis-dependent signaling.

In the \"urge to move\" ratings, type of musical excerpts was associated with ratings in both groups, with previous research revealing higher ratings for musical excerpts with higher groove ratings (Janata et al., 2012).

To test this hypothesis, we analysed the SN dynamics of a group of patients with episodic migraine in three distinct conditions: at rest during a spontaneous migraine attack (ictal phase); while performing an imagery task aiming to elicit the experience of a previous attack, during the interictal phase; and at rest, during the interictal phase. For comparison, we also studied a group of healthy controls in three matching conditions, including rest as well as an imagery task of a (non-migraine) head pain experience. We collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and used a dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis to examine the temporal features of the SN from a total of 78 samples. Compared to healthy controls, the SN had a significantly shorter lifetime in patients during the pain imagery task, but not during a migraine attack or interictal resting state. Our results support the disruption of the SN in migraine, and indicate that pain imagery may be a useful paradigm for isolating the emotional and cognitive aspects of pain and investigating SN dynamics.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we report an immunologically engineered injectable nano-hydrogel (iHG) that can: (i) recruit the desired set of immune cells away from the suppressed TME and peripheral organs, (ii) activate them within a protective ambit of engineered immune-stimulatory hydrogel niche, and (iii) release them to target cancer even in distant locations. Biodegradable and injectable iHG compositions were tested and optimized for their ability to attract and activate dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, NK cells, B cells, and T cells via STING, TLR, CD86, and Th1-polarized cytokine pathway without requiring exogenously introduced neo-antigens as vaccines. In a mouse melanoma model, optimized iHGs elicited a robust antitumor immune response through innate and adaptive arms. Most importantly, iHGs as a single agent immunomodulator exhibited better tumor control than when combined with anti-PD1 immune checkpoint antibody. These findings highlight the potential of engineering immunologically functional and injectable hydrogel niches as a new type of immunotherapeutics to reprogram immune cells to overcome both local and systemic immunosuppression and combat cancer effectively.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play an important role in limiting pathogen entry and colonization. Despite intensive research into the regulation and biochemical properties of AMPs, their exact significance in vivo has remained uncertain due to the challenges of mutating small genes. Fortunately, recent technologies have enabled the mutation of individual AMP genes, overcome previous obstacles, and opened new avenues for research. In this study, we characterized one novel host-defense peptide, Paillotin (IM18, CG33706), using loss-of-function mutants. Paillotin is an ancient host defense peptide of Diptera, regulated by the Imd pathway. Loss of Paillotin does not impact the activity of either the Imd or Toll pathways. Importantly, we found that Paillotin mutants are viable but exhibit increased susceptibility to specific infections, particularly Providencia burhodogranariea. Paillotin was further found to contribute synergistically to defense against P. burhodogranariea when combined with other AMPs. However, we did not detect direct microbicidal activity of Paillotin in vitro in our hands. Taken together, our findings identify Paillotin as a novel host defense peptide acting downstream of Imd signaling, advancing our understanding of the Drosophila antimicrobial response.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

In this article, we present the first report on the antifungal susceptibility of C. auris in Vietnam (specifically at Cho Ray Hospital), using the broth microdilution method recommended by CLSI. We employed the Sensititre YeastOne - YO10 antifungal panel, and the susceptibility (S) rates of C. auris were 81.6% to caspofungin, 94.7% to fluconazole, and 71.1% to amphotericin B. The rate of resistance to all three antifungal drug classes (azoles, echinocandins, and polyenes) was 0%, while resistance to two antifungal drug classes accounted for 7.9% (3/38 isolates), and resistance to one of the three drug classes was observed in 36.8% of cases. Additionally, we assessed the relatedness of 38 C. auris isolates using two methods: broth microdilution combined with colorimetric analysis (Sensititre YeastOne - YO10) and gradient diffusion (Etest) according to US CDC standards.

Glycans are comprised of various types of monosaccharides that are linked together at different positions and with varied stereochemistry. In addition, glycans are frequently decorated with a diverse set of chemical modifications, termed post-glycosylation modifications (PGMs). Characterization of PGMs is essential for a thorough understanding of glycans, however, the technical challenges and low throughput of current methodologies have limited our understanding of these modifications. Here we demonstrate a novel approach for rapid visualization of specific PGMs present in tissue N-glycans by applying PGM-targeting enzymes to mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). The method enables in situ investigation of glycans with PGMs en masse, identifying the sugar residue and position modified, as well as visualizing the spatial distribution of each modified N-glycan in tissues. As the repertoire of PGM-targeting enzymes expands, we anticipate this approach will enable a better understanding of PGM distribution within a dynamic N-glycome.

M.; Yang, S.; Bennett, J. B.; Filipovic, I.; Rasic, G.", "abstract": "Close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) methods have recently been used to infer demographic parameters for several aquatic and terrestrial species. For mosquitoes, the spatial distribution of close-kin pairs has been used to estimate mean dispersal distance, of relevance to vector-borne disease transmission and genetic biocontrol strategies. Close-kin methods have advantages over traditional mark-release-recapture (MRR) methods as the mark is genetic, removing the need for physical marking and recapturing that may interfere with movement behavior. Here, we extend CKMR methods to accommodate spatial structure alongside life history for mosquitoes and comparable insects. We derive kinship probabilities for parent-offspring and full-sibling pairs in a spatial context, where an individual in each pair may be a larva or adult. Using the dengue vector Aedes aegypti as a case study, we use an individual-based model of mosquito life history to test the effectiveness of this approach at estimating parameters such as mean dispersal distance, daily staying probability, and the strength of a barrier to movement. Considering a simulated population of 9,025 adult mosquitoes arranged on a 19-by-19 grid, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased and precise estimates of mean dispersal distance given a total of 2,500 adult females sampled over a three-month period using 25 traps evenly spread throughout the landscape. The CKMR approach is also able to estimate parameters of more complex dispersal kernels, such as the daily staying probability of a zero-inflated exponential kernel, or the strength of a barrier to movement, provided the magnitude of these parameters is greater than 0.5. These results suggest that CKMR provides an insightful characterization of mosquito dispersal that is complementary to conventional MRR methods.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Hence, understanding the processes driving such patterns is critical towards One Health. While anthropogenic disturbance is known to promote habitat-generalist host species through biotic homogenisation, generalist parasites (wider host breadth) also respond positively to the disturbed habitats. We hypothesise that generalist parasites are more likely to infect generalist hosts. We tested this hypothesis in a sky island system where generalist (Plasmodium) and specialist (Haemoproteus) haemosporidian parasites infect a range of bird hosts in disturbed and natural forest patches. We used a natural experiment framework to control for climatic differences (similar elevation) and habitat quality (same habitat type, but varying disturbance matrix). We collected 1106 samples from the field and examined the genus-level parasite prevalence and the host specificity of individual parasite lineages. Our results suggest that the generalist (Plasmodium) parasites are more prevalent in generalist birds, irrespective of disturbance. However, the specialist (Haemoproteus) parasites were more prevalent in specialist birds in natural forests than in disturbed forests. Among the individual parasite lineages, we found the host specificity to be associated with the degree of habitat specialisation of their host species. Our results provide evidence for the tendency of generalist parasites to infect generalist host species - a potential mechanism for a higher risk of emerging infectious diseases in human-dominated regions. We emphasise the role of host ecology in understanding the impact of anthropogenic disturbance on parasite prevalence in free-ranging host communities.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

However, our knowledge about the early evolutionary stage of this relationship remains limited. The association between the ciliate Tetrahymena utriculariae and its algal endosymbiont Micractinium tetrahymenae indicates an incipient stage of endosymbiosis. Although T. utriculariae cells rely on endosymbiotic algae to grow in low-oxygen conditions, they gradually lose the endosymbionts in aerobic conditions. Our comparative genomics reveals that the mitochondria-related genes of T. utriculariae are fast-evolving. Symbiotic cells display elongated mitochondria, which interact intimately with endosymbionts. Moreover, inhibiting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation reduces host fitness but increases the endosymbiont population. Time-series transcriptomics reveal physiological fine-tuning of the host during day and night, underscoring adaptations for nutrient exchange and regulation. Notably, endosymbiotic algae downregulate photosynthesis-related genes compared with free-living cells, correlated with a substantially reduced chlorophyll content. These findings indicate that the endosymbionts exploit host metabolites to supplement reduced photosynthesis. Consistently, symbiotic Tetrahymena cells exhibit lower fitness under aerobic conditions than aposymbiotic cells. Our results support that mutualistic and parasitic relationships between symbiotic organisms are condition-dependent, especially at an early evolutionary stage.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Our dataset comprises over 2,500 samples collected over a 13-yr period across 10 African countries and two European airports. Relying on an expert analytical pipeline and ~8,700 nucleotide sequences, we identified 96% of samples to the species-level. In contrast, we estimated that conventional two-gene approaches would have yielded 18-26% erroneous or inconclusive taxonomic assignments. DNA-typing refined > 50% of field identifications, with refinement reaching 92-95% for highly processed carcasses seized in Europe. Leveraging expanded taxonomic representation, we empirically refined the genetic species thresholds applied to bushmeat and provide a reproducible pipeline for using our expert reference database from NCBI. Overall, we identified 133 species--mostly mammals--with one-third listed as of conservation concern, and uncovered cryptic diversity evidence within several taxa. Our results also demonstrated the value of community ecology indexes for large-scale monitoring of the bushmeat trade. While national markets generally mirrored regional biodiversity patterns across tropical Africa, Benin emerged as a notable outlier and a key wildlife trade hotspot. We advocate for the integration of community ecology frameworks into surveillance efforts to guide more effective, regionally tailored mitigation strategies.

First, we carried out RNA-seq of 120 single-TF-deletion strains, together with wild-type controls. We then applied NetProphet3, a TF network mapping algorithm, to predict the direct functional targets of each TF. Unexpectedly, analysis of this network indicated that there are no TFs that primarily regulate genes involved in capsule formation . Rather, the TFs that play a role in deploying capsule also regulate many other genes and processes. Comparison to a TF network map we built for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a distantly related model yeast, identified pairs of TFs that are functionally orthologous -- that is, their targets are enriched for orthologous genes.

Within the same strain, model organisms are typically assumed to be isogenic; for T. gondii, within-strain genetic divergence has been detected based on phenotypic changes and older molecular techniques but not characterized at the genomic level. We therefore used Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing to characterize three independently maintained T. gondii ME49 isolates: 2015T and 2020T (obtained from ATCC and propagated in cell culture), and 2000B (propagated in mice). Results: We de novo assembled a new T. gondii ME49 reference genome and, using state of-the-art variant calling combined with pangenomic genotyping, detected variants between the sequenced isolates. Our new reference genome exceeded existing reference genomes in continuity (NG50 = 6.68 Mb versus 1.2 Mb in RefSeq) and structural accuracy, resolving all chromosomes except for a single break in the ribosomal DNA region. For isolates 2000B and 2020T, we identified 106 and 128 variants, respectively, across a final call set of 79 SNVs, 93 INDELs, and five structural variants; 24 small non-synonymous variants included genes associated with T. gondii life cycle (AP2X-8) and virulence in vivo (6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase). A 13 kb expansion in the ROP8-ROP2A virulence locus increased the copy number of ROP2A-ROP8 genes in isolates 2000B and 2020T from three to six.

We used methods from growth studies to quantitatively describe the non-linear age-trajectory of the mother-infant spatial relationship, and the transition from dependent to independent feeding and locomotion in wild Assamese macaques (M. assamensis).

Newborns were fully dependent on their mothers for feeding and transportation, with mothers maintaining close proximity. A transitional phase emerged between 1 and 3 months of infant age, marked by a noticeable reduction in the spatial proximity with the mother and a shift in the responsibility for the infant's feeding and transportation. During the second half of infancy, the decrease in proximity time slowed down, with infants achieving near-complete locomotion independence, spending the majority of time away from their mothers and feeding independently. No sex differences were found. Our models provided a robust fit for most variables, but we recommend future exploration of alternative nonlinear functions.

Aggression assays revealed that unparasitized hosts exhibited high aggression toward non-nestmate conspecifics and parasites. In contrast, parasitized hosts showed significantly lower aggression toward non-nestmate conspecifics and parasites, while maintaining considerable aggression toward a non-parasitic congener as a positive control. This suggests that parasites modify the nestmate discrimination patterns of the hosts rather than merely suppressing aggression. Furthermore, chemical analysis of cuticular hydrocarbons revealed that hosts from mixed-species colonies of hosts and parasites had profiles resembling those of unparasitized hosts, whereas parasites from mixed-species and parasite-only colonies showed distinct profiles. Notably, parasites from mixed-species colonies had hydrocarbon profiles resembling those of their hosts, indicating that L. umbratus employs chemical mimicry to alter host behaviour.

Small modifications to Ub such as phosphorylation, acetylation, or ADP-ribosylation have varying impacts on signaling.

Our previous work found ester-linked mono-ADPr ubiquitylation (MARUbylation) on PARP7 and PARP10 in cells and that this mark is extended with K11 polyUb. We previously screened for E3 ligases that interact with PARP7 through three different approaches and identified six candidates, including the Deltex family member DTX2. One of these hits, RNF114, interacts with various other PARPs, leading us to hypothesize that RNF114 binds to sites of MARUbylation and extends K11 polyUb. Here, we show that DTX2 generates the initial MARUbe on PARP7 in cells, which depends on PARP7 catalytic activity. The MARUbe on PARP7 is extended with K11 polyUb by RNF114. To investigate the mechanism of RNF114 reader/writer function, we developed a click chemistry-inspired chemoenzymatic approach to create a novel fluorescent Ub-ADPr probe for studying its interaction with RNF114. Strikingly, we found that RNF114 has a weak affinity for ADPr and Ub separately but explicitly recognizes the linkage between Ub and ADPr present in MARUbylated species. We used AlphaFold3 modeling to examine the mechanisms of Ub-ADPr recognition and K11-linked polyUb extension by RNF114. We identified a tandem Di19-UIM module in RNF114 as a MARUbe-binding domain (MUBD), thus providing a reader function that interfaces with K11-specific writer activity.

Methods: from the digitalized dataset of an entire human coronary microcirculation, vascular beds associated to single branches are extracted and analysed to infer patterns in epicardial branching. 3D segmentations of the coronaries with and without this information are used to generate two different myocardial subdivisions, which are compared to the one obtained from the microcirculation data. The impact on haemodynamics is assessed through computational simulations. Results: epicardial arteries exhibit characteristic patterns of transverse branching, with branching angles {approx} 90{degrees} and rate of branching, with respect to the distance along the vessel, depending on the core diameter. The addition of transverse outflows to the segmentations greatly increases accuracy in the myocardial subdivision, allowing discrimination between mass perfused by the proximal and distal arterial segments. Perfusion simulations including transverse outflows show more homogeneous blood flow across the myocardium, consistently with experimental findings. Conclusions: the inclusion of transverse outflows in 3D coronary segmentations is essential to correctly capture the coronary-myocardium association and the distribution of myocardial blood flow.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Marketable yield, fruit number, and average fruit weight also improved, with the highest values observed in DP 2 and DP 3 treatments. Fruit quality parameters, including total soluble solids (6.2 {degrees}Brix) and lycopene content (4.8 mg/100g), were significantly higher in these groups. Plant growth metrics, such as height (70 cm), leaf number (25 leaves), and biomass accumulation, were markedly increased. Physiological traits, including photosynthetic rate (18.5 mol CO 2 m-2 s-1), chlorophyll content, and stomatal conductance, were also enhanced. Nutrient uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as antioxidant enzyme activities (PAL, peroxidase, catalase, and SOD), were significantly elevated, while malondialdehyde (MDA) content was reduced.

Current methods, including diffusion models, often produce small molecules with difficult-to-synthesize structures, poor medicinal chemistry properties, and limited target selectivity. To address these limitations, we introduce MedSAGE, a novel generative AI framework that adapts diffusion models specifically for de novo small-molecule design. Rather than using atoms or strings, we develop a novel representation for generating molecules using fragments relevant for medicinal chemistry. Chemical and geometric information characterizing these fragments is embedded in a smooth and interpretable latent space. We also develop an algorithm to optimize the connectivity between generated fragments while preserving chemical validity and synthesizability. In a benchmark of multiple methods across 25 therapeutically relevant protein targets, MedSAGE achieved state-of-the-art performance, producing synthesizable, drug-like molecules with predicted affinity and selectivity closely matching known drugs and drug candidates. Compared to large-scale virtual screening, MedSAGE produced molecules with high predicted affinity over 100 times more efficiently. Our results demonstrate that MedSAGE is already practically useful and paves the way for next-generation tools in structure-guided drug design.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

G.; Conway, D. E.", "abstract": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a large multi-protein structure that enables movement of macromolecules, such as mRNA and proteins, between the nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. There has been great interest in how the physical state of the NPC can influence nuclear-cytoplasmic transport. The hypothesis that the NPC may be mechanosensitive is supported by prior reports showing that the diameter of the NPC increases with nuclear envelope stretch as well as increased ECM stiffness. We therefore sought to develop a biosensor-based approach to determine if the NPC experiences mechanical tension. Using a previously developed FRET-force biosensor, known as TSmod, we developed a gp210 tension sensor. gp210 is a transmembrane nucleoporin, which may serve to anchor the NPC into the nuclear envelope. Using a CRISPR knock-in strategy, we developed a HeLa cell line which expresses the gp210 tension sensor at endogenous levels. Using this sensor, we observed that gp210 forces increase in response to osmotically induced nuclear swelling. Cell attachment, ECM stiffness, the nuclear LINC complex, chromatin condensation, and actomyosin contractility were all observed to influence gp210 forces. Surprisingly, gp210 forces were increased with chromatin relaxation and myosin light chain kinase inhibition, indicating that NPC forces may be differentially regulated from forces on the LINC complex. Our data support a hypothesis where nuclear strain, rather than cytoskeletal forces, is the predominant source for NPC forces. Our studies demonstrate that NPC proteins do experience mechanical tension. We anticipate that the gp210 force sensor will be of use for future studies of NPC mechanobiology.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

However, the structural information on allosteric pockets remains limited for most kinases in the human kinome. In this work, we present comprehensive characterization of a type III allosteric pocket in the insulin receptor kinase (IRK) by uncovering its structural features and conformational dynamics. Specifically, we used microsecond-scale atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate apo and inhibitor-bound IRK structures. Our findings suggest that the type III allosteric site is a \"back pocket\" in IRK, sandwiched between the N-terminal and the C-terminal lobes, beneath the C-helix and the {beta}-sheets of the N-terminal lobe. It has a hydrophobic cleft composed of both aliphatic and aromatic non-polar residues and a charge center to facilitate electrostatic interactions. We explored the binding of an experimentally known IRK inhibitor to the newly discovered allosteric pocket. Our results indicate that the C-helix adopts an \"out\" conformation stabilized by the inhibitor which promotes an inactive conformation of the kinase. Furthermore, we observed a helical intermediate formation in the activation loop and a stable \"DFG-out\" conformation in both inhibitor-bound and unbound states. Our results also suggest that the residue M1051 in IRK functions as a gatekeeper residue, essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the C-helix and regulating the binding of the allosteric inhibitor.

A.", "abstract": "Background: Organotypic assays are three-dimensional in vitro models widely used in cancer research to mimic the in vivo extracellular matrix (ECM) and to study cancer cell invasion by allowing investigation of critical interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment. During invasion, cancer cells undergo genetic and epigenetic changes that disrupt cell-cell adhesion, enabling detachment from the primary tumor. Subsequently, invasive cells must (i) breach the basement membrane, a dense protein meshwork that restricts cell movement, and (ii) migrate through the surrounding ECM. This process relies on proteolytic enzyme secretion to degrade structural barriers, followed by cell-matrix adhesion-mediated migration. Methods: We present an in silico model of cancer cell invasion in organotypic assays. The model is formulated as a system of partial differential equations capturing spatiotemporal dynamics, with nonlocal terms representing preferential adhesion-driven movement. Key variables in the model are cancer cells, proteolytic enzymes, and the ECM. Results: Computational simulations demonstrate that modulation of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion parameters significantly influences tumor invasiveness. This result is consistent with experimental observations, demonstrating the model's ability to accurately reflect in vitro behavior.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Yet, the mechanisms underlying enduring alterations in stress-regulatory systems remain underexplored. This multimodal study examines autonomic, endocrine, and affective reactivity in young adults with a history of severe PV. METHODS: Eyeblink startle electromyograms, pupil dilation, hair cortisol, resting heart rate variability, and self-reported state anxiety were assessed in 182 young adults (age 22) with longitudinal data on adolescent PV (ages 11-20). Effects were estimated using a counterfactual framework with genetically informed inverse probability weighting --leveraging polygenic risk scores and genetic ancestry--and adjustment for time-varying confounders. RESULTS: Victims exhibited heightened startle amplitudes compared to controls, with negative stimuli (angry faces) further exaggerating amplitude and prolonging latency. Pupil dilation increased in response to negative stimuli, but was otherwise blunted. Victims also showed reduced resting heart rate variability, elevated hair cortisol, and slower state anxiety recovery across the session. Depression moderated several effects; more depressed victims showed hypocortisolism and reduced autonomic reactivity. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide converging evidence and mechanistic insight into potential links between PV and trauma-like physiological effects, suggesting sustained alterations into young adulthood. Targeted interventions are needed to reduce PV and its stress-related dysregulation, preventing potential long-term psychiatric and societal sequelae.

However, in complex and dynamic environments, fast reactions are meaningful only when grounded in accurate judgments and correct choices, which often require cognitive control. Here, we investigate how threat intensity, reward value, and social hierarchy influence behavioral decisions in foraging mice exposed to overhead visual threats. We find that threat intensity plays a dominant role in decision-making: elevated threat levels trigger robust defensive responses, including shorter latencies to flee, increased fleeing speeds, and longer escape distances. The influence of reward is context-dependent: at low threat levels, higher reward values suppress defensive responses, leading to prolonged time in the reward zone, slower speeds, and shorter escape distances. In contrast, under high-threat conditions, increasing reward value enhances sensitivity to threats, as evidenced by shorter latencies to flee and heightened vigilance. Social hierarchy further shapes decision-making, with dominant mice exhibiting greater vigilance and a stronger preference for risk-averse behaviors compared to subordinates. To quantify the decision-making process, we developed a drift-diffusion leaky integrator model that successfully captures how mice integrate threat intensity, reward value, and vigilance into their behavioral decisions. Our findings reveal the economic and social modulation of survival decisions, offering insights into the computational mechanisms underlying the interplay between instinctive reaction and cognitive control in innate decision-making.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Our results demonstrate that this agent not only autonomously regulates its internal temperature by navigating to areas with optimal environmental conditions, but also harmonizes this process with other internal needs, such as energy, hydration, security, and mating. This biomimetic agent outperforms a control agent lacking interoceptive awareness in terms of efficiency, fairness, and stability. Additionally, to demonstrate the flexibility of our framework, we develop a \"cautious\" agent that prioritizes security over other needs, achieving a Maslow-like hierarchical organization of internal needs.

SARM1 is allosterically activated by an increased NMN/NAD+ ratio resulting from depletion of NAD+ or accumulation of its precursor, NMN, typically due to loss of the labile NAD+ synthetase NMNAT2 following axon injury. Another NAD+ hydrolase, PARP1, is hyperactivated by DNA damage, triggering the Parthanatos cell death pathway. We demonstrate that multiple mechanistically-distinct DNA-damaging agents lead to SARM1 activation and axon degeneration following PARP1 activation. Remarkably, SARM1 is required for key steps downstream of PARP1 activation by DNA damage that are pathognomonic of Parthanatos, including mitochondrial depolarization, nuclear translocation of AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor), and cell death. Moreover, SARM1 mediates glutamate excitotoxicity, a clinically significant pathomechanism attributed to Parthanatos.

However, the roles played by putative biosynthetic enzymes remain experimentally uninvestigated. Here, the biosynthetic functions of enzymes encoded by mmyD, mmyO, mmyF and mmyE were investigated by creating in-frame deletions in each gene and investigating the effect on methylenomycin produc-tion. No methylenomycin-related metabolites were produced by the mmyD mutant, consistent with the proposed role of MmyD in an early biosynthetic step. The production of methylenomycin A, but not methylenomycin C, was abolished in the mmyF and mmyO mutants, consistent with the corresponding enzymes catalyzing epoxidation of methylenomycin C, as previously proposed. Expression of mmyF and mmyO in a S. coelicolor M145 derivative engineered to express mmr, which confers methylenomycin resistance, enabled the resulting strain to convert methylenomycin C to methylenomycin A, confirming this hypothesis.

By employing rsEGFP2 and patterned depletion illumination (PD) to generate the desired nonlinearity in the fluorescent response, we have successfully achieved 2D PD-NSIM imaging of actin in live U2OS cells with sub-80 nm resolution.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Current approaches, however, are hampered by slow turnaround times and large sample volume requirements, limiting the exploration of disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies. Here, we developed a microfluidic digital ELISA platform prototype, combining single-molecule counting with whole blood assay capability for the first time from small animal models. This platform is automated and enables repeated, rapid biomarker monitoring with just 3.5 uL of whole blood collected from the tail. Our platform demonstrated high sensitivity and multiplexity, allowing real-time cytokine profiling within a 2-hour turnaround. Using a murine sepsis model, we achieved precise temporal monitoring of cytokine levels, demonstrating prognostic capability by correlating early-stage cytokine levels with a liver-injury biomarker. This microfluidic platform enables high temporal resolution and rapid monitoring of biomarker dynamics in a single mouse using freshly collected whole blood, significantly reducing the number of animals needed for preclinical studies.

While a different number of total DMCs was identified by each tool, both pipelines detected a global hypomethylation as a result. Genomic analysis revealed a predominant distribution of DMCs in intergenic and intronic regions on one hand, and in open sea regions on the other hand. Despite the differences in sensitivity, both tools demonstrated moderate concordance in DMCs detection (~56%) and high concordance in gene level analysis (~90%), identifying similar differentially methylated genes (DMGs). Overall, the results underscore the complementary strengths of methylKit and edgeR and highlight the importance of tool selection for epigenetic studies.

However, mainstream analytical methods primarily focus on the gene expression modality itself and struggle to fully leverage auxiliary information from histological images, which limits precise dissection of complex biological structures. To address this, we propose SpatialModal, a multimodal graph learning framework that effectively integrates gene expression data and histological images from spatial transcriptomics to construct unified spatial representations. SpatialModal effectively captures synergistic interactions between modalities by jointly modeling intra- and inter-modal complementary features while incorporating spatial adjacency information. Furthermore, it employs a dual contrastive learning strategy to enhance the discriminative power of representations, thereby enabling efficient and robust analysis of tissue structures. We validate the effectiveness of this approach on multiple public datasets covering diverse tissue types, species, and resolutions. Experiments demonstrate that SpatialModal exhibits significant advantages in downstream tasks, including spatial domain identification, gene expression reconstruction, and pseudotime inference, and accurately elucidates the hierarchical structure of the mouse cortex as well as the metabolic-immune dynamic boundaries in the breast cancer microenvironment.

Database mining was used to predict cancer and FSK-related protein targets. Then, the intersect FSK/Cancer common core targets [n=89] were identified. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to identify the gene hubs of core targets.

We address two challenges: evaluating tools and combinations ability to detect the effects of multiple concurrent mutations in protein variants, and leveraging large-scale datasets to compare modeling-free methods, namely force fields, which handle point mutations well with limited backbone rearrangement, and inverse folding tools, which excel at native sequence recovery but may struggle with non-natural proteins. Debuting TriCombine, a tool that identifies residue triangles in input structures, matches them to a structural database, and scores mutants based on substitution frequencies, we shortlisted candidates, modeled them with FoldX, and generated 16 SH3 mutants carrying up to 9 concurrent substitutions. The dataset was expanded to include 36 mutants and 11 crystal structures (7 newly solved), along with a parallel set of multiple non-concurrent mutants from three additional proteins. For broader validation, we analyzed 160,000 four-site GB1 mutants and 163,555 (single and double) variants across 179 natural and de novo domains. We show that combining AI-based modeling tools with force field scoring functions yields the most reliable results. Inverse folding tools perform very well but lose accuracy on less-represented proteins. First-principle force fields like FoldX remain the most accurate for point mutations.

It is notable for its ability to adopt multiple conformational states depending on its structural environment, particularly on the identity of the flanking canonical base pairs. Here, we employed extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to systematically investigate the conformational dynamics of a U:U mismatch embedded within a model A-form RNA helix, flanked by all possible canonical base pair combinations. We found that the neighboring base pairs strongly influence the preferred conformational states of the U:U mismatch. However, the mismatch still regularly samples the less favored conformations on a timescale of hundreds of nanoseconds. Contrary to previous assumptions, water-mediated conformations are not universally the most stable conformational states for isolated U:U mismatches as some of the variants distinctly prefer the direct H-bonding while others destabilize the U:U mismatch altogether. Our results strongly suggest that the presence of a U:U mismatch introduces local strain into the RNA helix, which can be relieved through dynamic destabilization of either the mismatch itself or the flanking canonical base pairs, occasionally forming a shifting \"bubble\" of instability. These findings advance our understanding of U:U mismatch behavior in RNA and reveal a complex interplay between local sequence context, structural stability, and RNA dynamics.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Upon maturation, core-1, comprising of the 57 residues (39-95) in the N-terminus become structured, resulting in the formation of a non-polymorphic fibril. The truncated FUS-LC-C (residues 110-214) construct forms a fibril in which core-2 (residues 112-150) adopts a {beta}-sheet structure. Using coarse-grained monomer SOP-IDP model simulations of FUS-LC, we predict that residues 155-190 in the C-terminal (Core-3) form rapidly, followed by core-2, and finally core-3. The time scale of formation of the cores and their stabilities are inversely correlated, as anticipated by the Ostwald's rule of stages. Unbiased multichain simulations show that the chemical potentials in the two phases are equal and the calculated densities of the dense and dilute phases are in agreement with experiments. The dense phase, which forms by a nucleation mechanism, coarsens over time by a process that is reminiscent of Ostwald ripening. AlphaFold predictions of the core-3 structure and the simulations show that {beta} strand emerges in the core-3 region early during the droplet formation, and drives the initiation of FUS-LC assembly.

This branchial structure occurs in conjunction with toothed jaws, indicating a role for both in feeding. P. parvulus illustrates the assembly of the tongue bite in the geologically younger Bobasatraniidae: large opposing dorsal (vomerine) and ventral (basibranchial) crushing plates associated with toothless jaws. The origin of tongue bites falls within the Carboniferous actinopterygian radiation, although postdates the first signs of durophagy in other ray-finned lineages by several million years.

In addition, calcineurin inhibitors are immunosuppressants. This pleiotropy has precluded the use of calcineurin inhibitors as treatments for heart failure. Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4/TRIP10) is an endosomal scaffold protein that organizes a calcium and calcineurin A{beta}2 (CaNA{beta}2) signaling compartment activated by G-protein coupled receptors independently of contractile calcium. CIP4 binds CaNA{beta}2 via the CaNA{beta}-specific N-terminal polyproline (PP) domain. We previously showed that targeting of CIP4-CaNA{beta}2 signalosomes inhibited pathological cardiac hypertrophy and the development of heart failure induced by chronic pressure overload in mice. It is unknown whether CIP4-CaNA{beta}2 signalosomes contribute to cardioprotection and/or cardiac remodeling in ischemic heart disease. Methods: CIP4 conditional knock-out (CKO) mice were studied by echocardiography with strain analysis and histology following ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and permanent left coronary artery (LCA) ligation to induce myocardial infarction. Wildtype C57BL/6NJ mice were transduced with adeno-associated virus (AAV) engineered for cardiomyocyte-specific expression of either a CaNA{beta}2 shRNA to inhibit CaNA{beta}2 expression, a VIVIT peptide to inhibit CaN-NFAT signaling, or a CaNA{beta}2 PP peptide to block CIP4-CaNA{beta}2 binding. AAV-transduced mice were studied by I/R injury. Additional mice were subjected to permanent LCA ligation and subsequently treated with AAV to test the effects of CaN inhibition in chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. The effects of CaNA{beta}2 PP-GFP expression on primary T-cell activation were studied in vitro. Results: CIP4 CKO mice and mice expressing the PP anchoring disruptor peptide exhibited preserved cardiac function after I/R injury and decreased infarct size and preserved cardiac function 8 weeks after myocardial infarction by permanent LCA ligation. In contrast, cardiomyocyte-specific depletion of CaNA{beta}2 and VIVIT peptide expression worsened outcome after I/R injury and in chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy. In addition, in contrast to cardiomyocytes, PP-mediated CaNA{beta} anchoring inhibition had no effect on T-cell activation and cytokine expression in vitro. Conclusions: CIP4-CaNA{beta}2 signalosomes promote adverse cardiac remodeling and are not cardioprotective. Proof-of-concept is provided for the treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy by a PP anchoring disruptor gene therapy. Targeting these complexes may be beneficial in cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic cardiomyopathy and acute myocardial infarction.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

R.; Hahn, D. A.; Moore, M. P.; Ragland, G. J.", "abstract": "Variable thermal environments may have both detrimental and beneficial effects. For example, extreme temperatures may challenge homeostasis and inflict tissue damage but may also induce acclimation that improves stress resilience. Hormetic models provide a framework to understand dosage-dependent, contrasting beneficial and detrimental effects from physiological and ecological perspectives. We used a hormetic framework and associated quantitative models to investigate how a range of relatively cold, pre-exposure temperatures influence survival and fertility following cold shock at a more extreme cold temperature in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Cold pre-exposure can induce a protective rapid cold hardening (RCH) response, fail to stimulate a response, or cause direct cold injury. We found a plateau-shaped relationship between pre-exposure temperature and female survival resilience, where survival following a cold shock remains high across a range of temperatures, with sharp transitions at higher and lower temperatures. Bayesian fitting of a bi-logistic model highlights these transitions at temperature thresholds that govern processes mediating both acclimation and cold injury. In contrast to survival, female fertility resilience exhibited a muted response to pre-exposure temperature in the presence and absence of post-stress mating opportunities. Overall, a range of pre-exposure temperatures allowed low but successful reproduction following cold shock. High survival but low fertility resilience is consistent with a) differential impacts of cold on somatic and reproductive tissues and b) a growing body of literature suggesting that the thermal sensitivity of fertility may be more limiting than survival for population persistence in variable and changing climates.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

The former predicts a gradual reduction in error, until some asymptote, while the latter predicts behavioural exploration to discover an efficacious solution. An alternative explanation is that a sufficiently rich understanding of the task culminates in an 'Aha!' moment, which then allows the generation of a new solution. This predicts some period of perseveration in baseline behaviour, followed by an abrupt single-trial shift to a new strategic solution. To avoid obfuscation caused by the motor system, we investigate these hypotheses in a strategy-only aiming game, where participants aim and fire a cannon at targets. Most participants exhibited a period of baseline perseveration followed by a single-trial shift to good performance. We then applied the same analyses to reaching data from a visuomotor rotation task that inhibited implicit adaptation through delaying feedback presentation (Brudner et al., 2016). Similarly, we found that participants typically perseverated in reaching towards the target before suddenly switching, in a single trial, to good performance.

However, these whole-body mutants limit understanding of SJ1's role in the DA system. Here, we generated DA neuron-specific SJ1 conditional KO (SJ1-DA cKO) mice. Complete SJ1 loss caused severe synaptic dystrophy throughout the striatum, indicating a cell-autonomous role of SJ1 in both substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area DA subtypes. Surprisingly, despite profound synaptic degeneration and DA deficiency, SJ1-DA cKO mice showed no overt motor deficits. Instead, we observed a robust induction of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase-positive interneurons (iTHINs), which expressed multiple DA markers and formed new connections with degenerating DA terminals, suggesting a potential local compensation. In contrast, acute SJ1 deletion in adult/aged DA neurons caused similar terminal pathology but limited iTHINs induction.

This approach resulted in efficient maltose conversion in buckwheat wort and improved maltotriose conversion in barley wort. Three evolved clones from each evolutionary experiment were sequenced using short-read technology and aligned to the chromosome-level assembly of the ancestral cider strain. We observed pronounced genomic changes, including near-complete loss-of-heterozygosity, novel single-nucleotide mutations, and chromosomal aberrations resulting in altered chromosome copy numbers or segmental duplications. Additionally, the clones adapted to buckwheat wort were respiratory-deficient, either lacking or having impaired mitochondrial DNA, whereas clones adapted to barley wort retained a truncated mitochondrial genome. These genetic changes mirror hallmarks of beer yeast domestication and were also reflected phenotypically, including loss of sporulation capacity, decreased fitness under non-brewing conditions, and altered production of aromatic compounds.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

The single nucleotide polymorphism rs6903956 on chromosome 6p24.1 has been identified as a susceptibility locus for CAD in East Asian populations through genome-wide association studies. However, its functional role has not been fully elucidated. This study investigates the mechanistic basis of rs6903956 and its contribution to CAD pathogenesis, focusing on endothelial cell dysfunction. We first conducted cohort studies, revealing an association between the rs6903956 risk allele A and blood pressure phenotypes, along with impaired endothelial responsiveness indicated by reduced flow-mediated dilation. Single-base editing of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells obtained from patients with CAD and expression quantitative trait loci analysis highlighted a cis-acting impact of the A allele on PHACTR1 and EDN1 expression, suggesting allele-specific regulatory effects. Using in silico modeling by AlphaFold 3 platform, the A allele exhibited enhanced binding affinity for HOXA4 and MEIS1 transcription factors, forming a stable ternary complex that promoted transcriptional activation of PHACTR1. Functional assays demonstrated the enhancer role of rs6903956 A allele in PHACTR1 promoter activity, supporting its locus-specific regulatory function in endothelial cells. Under pathological flow conditions, endothelial cells harboring the A allele display elevated ICAM-1 expression and increased monocyte adhesion compared to the G allele, indicating allele-specific endothelial inflammatory activation. These findings propose a model in which rs6903956 influences PHACTR1 expression via HOX-MEIS cooperative binding, thereby modulating endothelial function and contributing to CAD susceptibility. This study provides mechanistic insights into the role of rs6903956 in endothelial dysfunction and CAD, informing potential therapeutic targets arising from genetic determinants in cardiovascular pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we report a spontaneously occurring developmental error that results in the formation of the worms with double heads at the opposite ends of their bodies that misses the posterior pole identity. In the set of experiments, we show that the double head phenotype is not heritable on the organismal level. Worms originating from the sectioning or fission of the double head animals give rise to the healthy populations that do not display the erroneous asexual development. We also demonstrate that the posterior piece of the double head worm can survive, regenerate the tail on its previously anterior pole and resume the asexual reproduction. Effectively, such regeneration allows reversal of the body axis polarity without impairment of the survival or reproductive abilities of the animal, an exceptionally rare phenomenon among bilaterians.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Two main theories are proposed to explain the evolution of phenotypic plasticity - the climate variability hypothesis and the trade-off hypothesis - but the evidence for these hypotheses remains mixed. In the current study, we examine phenotypic plasticity (hardening capacity) in desiccation resistance across populations of Drosophila melanogaster collected along a climatic gradient from eastern Australia. While climate was an important driver of innate desiccation tolerance, we found no evidence of climate shaping hardened desiccation tolerance or hardening capacity. Instead, we found that populations with high tolerance tended to have lower plasticity, indicative of a trade-off. Further analyses, accounting for statistical non-independence, showed a strong negative correlation between innate desiccation tolerance and hardening capacity, supporting the trade-off hypothesis. These results suggest that for species with high tolerance, phenotypic plasticity is unlikely to contribute to their response to climate change.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we report on non-Mendelian inheritance and intra-individual instability of extrachromosomal gene copies, which are associated with rapid evolution of herbicide resistance in the dioecious, agricultural weed Amaranthus palmeri. Copy number variation for the glyphosate resistance gene EPSPS was quantified using digital droplet PCR within individuals, and for parents and offspring of controlled crosses with copy number ranging from 1 to ~160. Parent-offspring regressions of copy number indicates non-Mendelian inheritance. Heritability is higher (hG2=1.60) below ~33 copies, than above (hG2=0.22) because parents with fewer gene copies yield offspring with similar or increased mean copy number, whereas offspring of high copy number parents have fewer copies than parents. Intra-individual variance in copy number increased with mean individual copy number, likely contributing to variation observed in offspring copy number, but not sufficient to explain the most extreme transgressive copy number variants, nor the loss of high copy number. In short, copy number is less stable and less heritable in parents with more EPSPS copies, with offspring losing EPSPS copies.

To address this, we conducted experimental evolution using Drosophila melanogaster populations derived from opposite ends of a latitudinal cline in Australia (Melbourne and Townsville), exposing them to contrasting thermal environments and varying starting frequencies of two mtDNA haplotypes (A1 and B1) that each segregate at high frequencies in natural populations. We paired this approach with population genetic simulations to estimate selection and its influence on haplotype evolutionary trajectories. We found that mtDNA haplotype frequencies were influenced by complex interactions among temperature, starting frequency, and nuclear genomic background (Melbourne, Townsville, or admixed). Simulations supported directional selection as a driver of haplotype frequencies in populations evolving at 17 degrees Celsius in the Melbourne background, and otherwise selection was predominantly balancing and shaped by negative frequency-dependent fitness effects of the haplotypes.

Yet, for unknown reasons, this compensation is reversed in some individuals at some point to induce {beta}-cell failure and overt type 2 diabetes (T2D). We have previously shown that transcription factor Myt3 (St18) and its paralogs, Myt1 and Myt2, prevent {beta}-cell failure. Myt3 was induced at post-transcriptional levels by obesity-related stress in both mouse and human {beta} cells and its downregulation accompanied {beta}-cell dysfunction during T2D development. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in MYT3 were associated with an increased risk of developing human diabetes. We now demonstrate that Myt3 translation is regulated by an upstream open-reading frame that overlaps with the main Myt3 open-reading frame in mice. Disrupting this overlap enhances Myt3 translation in mouse {beta} cells without metabolic stress but decreases it under high-fat-diet challenges. Consequently, this deregulation results in {beta}-cell dysfunction and glucose intolerance in mice, accompanied by compromised expression of several {beta}-cell function genes.

Key questions include whether Microsporidia undergo sexual reproduction, and the nature of the relationship between tetraploid and diploid lineages. While few high-quality microsporidian genomes currently exist to help answer such questions, large-scale biodiversity genomics initiatives, such as the Darwin Tree of Life project, can generate high-quality genome assemblies for microsporidian parasites when sequencing infected host species. Here, we present 40 new microsporidian genome assemblies from infected arthropod hosts that were sequenced to create reference genomes. Out of the 40, 32 are complete genomes, eight of which are chromosome-level, and eight are partial microsporidian genomes. We characterised 14 of these as polyploid and five as diploid. We found that tetraploid genome haplotypes are consistent with autopolyploidy, in that they coalesce more recently than species, and that they likely recombine. Within some genomes, we found large-scale rearrangements between the homeologous genomes. We also observed a high rate of rearrangement between genomes from different microsporidian groups, and a striking tolerance for segmental duplications. Analysis of chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) data indicated that tetraploid genomes are likely organised into two diploid compartments, similar to dikaryotic cells in fungi, with evidence of recombination within and between compartments. Together, our results provide evidence for the existence of a sexual cycle in Microsporidia, and suggest a model for the microsporidian lifecycle that mirrors fungal reproduction.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

These gaps lead to inaccuracies in gene quantification and downstream functional analyses, ultimately reducing the effectiveness of zebrafish as a model system. Further challenges include ineffective ribodepletion methods and limited resources for validate transcript boundaries and splicing patterns. To overcome these challenges, we applied CapTrap-seq, a long-read sequencing method that combines Cap-trapping with oligo(dT) priming to identify 5'-capped, full-length transcripts from both developmental and adult tissue samples. To promote detection of longer RNA molecules, we introduced a size-selection step into the CapTrap-seq protocol, which further improved detection of transcript ends without compromising its quantitative accuracy.

Here, we used Drosophila spermatogenesis as a model to investigate retrotransposon mobilization dynamics. Although many retrotransposon families are transcriptionally active, we found that the LTR-retrotransposon nomad completes the full mobilization cascade--including mRNA export, protein translation, and reverse transcription--to produce double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) the most efficiently. Strikingly, despite successfully generating dsDNA, nomad rarely achieves genomic reintegration. Instead, its newly synthesized DNA predominantly forms extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA).

To address this limitation, we adapted AlphaFold3 into a score-only model, AF3Score, by directly feeding input coordinates into the confidence head while bypassing the diffusion-based structure module. AF3Score demonstrates robust performance in structural quality assessment across diverse systems including monomeric proteins, protein-protein complexes, de novo designed binders, and fold-switching proteins. In benchmarking designed binder screening, AF3Score outperformed state-of-the-art methods for 8 out of 10 targets.

We studied functional innate immune responses induced by pattern recognition receptor agonist adjuvants (PRRa). Using an optimized 49-parameter CyTOF panel and implementing machine learning (ML) algorithms, we mapped PRRa-mediated CD69, CD40, CD80, CD86 and CCR7 activation at the nodal innate immune subsets level.

We mapped neutrophils as the primary source of TLR7/8 agonist (TLR7/8a) and STING agonist mediated CCL4 responses in WB. Notably, in the PBMC fraction, where neutrophils are limited, natural killer (NK) cells became the major source of innate CCL4 production. TLR7/8a-mediated IFN{gamma} induction by early NK cells was mapped in PBMCs, which was limited in WB.

To explore a genetic link between negative FDS and overyielding, I conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of neighbor genotypic effects on the growth of 98 Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes. By incorporating neighbor genotypic similarity, my GWAS detected the most significant SNP on the fifth chromosome of A. thaliana, which was 6-kbp near a known locus responsible for indirect genetic effects. I found symmetric negative FDS on the most significant SNP, such that individual plants increased their biomass in the presence of neighbors with dissimilar alleles. I also observed overyielding in which a biallelic mixture of the most significant SNP showed a 3% increase in biomass compared to monoallelic conditions. Furthermore, I focused on the genomic region near the most significant SNP and found a signature of balancing selection near a negative regulator of ethylene responses SIRTUIN2.

J.", "abstract": "Malaria, a febrile disease caused by the Plasmodium parasites and transmitted by mosquitoes, is a leading cause of mortality in children under 5 in endemic countries. The widespread deployment of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) has significantly reduced malaria transmission, but rising levels of insecticide resistance threatens to halt the progress. Monitoring insecticide resistance is vital for effective vector control, particularly when deploying new tools. Understanding mosquito population responses to these interventions is crucial for guiding control programmes in making informed decisions about the selection, timing, and geographic deployment of tools. This genomic study investigates the demographic and evolutionary consequences on the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae of deploying standard ITNs (containing only pyrethroids) and pyrethroid-PBO nets (containing pyrethroids plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide) during a clinical trial in Uganda. Despite substantial reductions in indoor mosquito densities in the clinical trial, estimates of nucleotide diversity ({pi}) and linkage disequilibrium revealed no significant decline in effective population size, reflecting continued large population size even after effective control. Marked allele frequency shifts at resistance-associated loci indicated strong selection pressures driven by the interventions, with distinct selective dynamics between the two net types, highlighting alternative pyrethroid detoxification pathways in the presence of PBO. A duplication in the Cyp9k1 gene significantly increased in frequency in populations exposed to pyrethroid-only nets but decreased in populations exposed to PBO-treated nets, suggesting that selection for over-expression of this gene is removed when this resistance mechanism is impacted by PBO. An alternative potential detoxification mechanism was selected within a region of the 2La chromosomal inversion on chromosome 2L, which encompasses the UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase gene. This variant consistently increased in frequency when exposed to PBO-treated nets. Additionally, pyrethroid-only nets selected for a novel locus on the X chromosome containing the diacylglycerol kinase gene, which is potentially linked to behavioural adaptations through its role in neurotransmission modulation. Our findings underscore the importance of genomic surveillance in vector control, revealing distinct evolutionary dynamics of insecticide resistance mechanisms in the presence of PBO. While ITNs remain effective, the persistence and evolution of resistance-associated alleles highlight the need for adaptive and dynamic resistance management strategies. By integrating high-resolution genomic data with epidemiological and entomological monitoring, this study offers actionable insights to sustain malaria control efforts amid the ongoing challenge of insecticide resistance.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

In eukaryotic promoters, nucleosome organization is highly structured, with nucleosomes occupying canonical positions flanking the transcription start site (TSS), thereby regulating access of the transcriptional machinery to the underlying DNA. We determine whether this canonical distribution is present in the purple sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, a species of ecological importance and a model organism for developmental biology and climate science. We used titrations of micrococcal nuclease to produce high throughput maps of nucleosome distribution and sensitivity to digestion from female urchin gonad tissue. Unlike yeast, flies, zebrafish, maize, mice or humans, urchins have extended nucleosome repeat lengths and lack a nucleosome depleted region over TSSs. Urchin promoters are dominated by strongly positioned and highly occupied +1 and +2 nucleosomes which are most prominent in highly expressed genes. Additionally, urchin promoters exhibit distinct patterns of susceptibility to nuclease digestion, with heightened sensitivity upstream of the TSS and limited resistance to nuclease digestion. Discretely positioned sensitive nucleosomes were enriched in promoters of highly expressed genes, suggesting a relationship between nucleosome sensitivity and transcriptional regulation. Collectively, we present a comprehensive overview of the unique interplay between nucleosome positioning and chromatin sensitivity in sea urchins.

A common diagnostic criterion for PTSD includes heightened physiological reactivity to trauma-related sensory cues, in safe or familiar environments. Understanding complex PTSD criteria requires new pre-clinical paradigms and technologies that integrate sensory physiology (e.g., auditory, visual, olfactory) with behavior. Here we present a novel Pavlovian-based paradigm using an open-source software plus deep learning-based pose estimation to investigate the effects of a recurrent conditioned stimulus (CS) on fear behaviors in pair-housed mice within the home cage. Simultaneous home cage video recording and analysis of CS-evoked freezing behaviors were performed using a deep learning model, with consideration for light-dark circadian cycles. Fear-conditioned dyad mice exhibited high CS-evoked freezing, with evidence of extinction learning (characterized by low freezing) during the mid-phase of the 2-week paradigm. Females exhibited reduced CS-evoked home cage freezing compared to males with circadian differences between the light (low freezing) and dark (high freezing) periods. Following the 2-week paradigm, fear-conditioned mice, compared to controls, exhibited heightened context-dependent freezing, while males but not females showed heightened startle reactivity. Taken together, these results demonstrate a novel software application for examining conditioned defensive and fear behaviors over time in mouse dyads within an ethologically relevant environment. Future applications could be used for more integrative analysis and understanding of neural circuits and heightened sensory threat reactivity, potentially improving the understanding and treatment of PTSD.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

To resolve the debate, we studied twelve taikonauts aboard the China Space Station performing a classical hand-reaching task. Compared to their pre-flight performance and to an age-matched control group, participants showed increased movement durations and altered kinematic profiles in microgravity. Model-based analyses of motor control parameters revealed that these changes stemmed from reduced initial force generation in the feedforward control phase followed by compensatory feedback-based corrections. These findings support the body mass underestimation hypothesis while refuting the strategic slowing hypothesis. Importantly, sensory estimate of bodily property in microgravity is biased but evaded from sensorimotor adaptation, calling for an extension of existing theories of motor learning.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Here we show that PRC2 subcomplexes have distinct roles in epigenetic repression of lineage-specific genes and stem cell differentiation. Using a human pluripotent stem cell model, we engineered a comprehensive set of separation-of-function mutants to dissect the roles of individual protein-protein and DNA-protein interactions. Our results show that PRC2.1 and PRC2.2 deposit H3K27me3 locus-specifically, resulting in opposing outcomes in cardiomyocyte differentiation. We find that MTF2 stimulates PRC2.1-mediated repression in stem cells and cardiac differentiation through its interaction with DNA and H3K36me3, while PHF19 antagonizes it. Furthermore, MTF2-PRC2.1 maintains normal cardiomyocyte function.

Despite their prevalence in Argonaute proteins, the role of these motifs remains poorly understood. In this study, we focus on the RG motifs within the N-terminal region of Caenorhabditis elegans PRG-1, a PIWI clade Argonaute. Using sequence alignment across Caenorhabditis species, we identify three conserved RG motifs that are methylated, as confirmed by mass spectrometry. The region surrounding these motifs is intrinsically disordered, as predicted by disorder algorithms and structural modeling. While the RG motifs are critical for fertility, germline morphology, and piRNA silencing, they are not required for PRG-1 expression, localization, or piRNA loading. Notably, mutation of the RG motifs results in defects in downstream small RNA production, specifically the depletion of mutator class siRNAs, without affecting piRNA biogenesis. These findings suggest that the RG motifs of PRG-1 play a crucial role in linking piRNA-mediated silencing to siRNA production, and that their function is critical for fertility and germline maintenance in C. elegans. Despite these defects, the phenotypic severity in the RG mutant is milder than in a PRG-1 null mutant, highlighting the complexity of PRG-1 function and its post-translational modifications.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

We find that increasing herbivory is matched with increasing dental complexity, with comparable effect sizes to those found on the macroevolutionary scale. We do not, however, find clear evidence of divergence of tooth complexity between sexes within populations (in a way that would be consistent with niche divergence), meaning that the extent to which this trait is plastic remains controversial.

We therefore reinvestigated this original example by comparing D. obscura strains with and without distortion (SR and ST strains, respectively). Crossing experiments indicated the presence of a driver on the X chromosome and predicted the existence of a suppressor. Using comparative genomics, we identified an X-linked gene, Gcna, as a candidate driver; the region encoding the SprT-like domain of this gene was massively duplicated only in the SR genome. We further identified a candidate suppressor, miR-9c, that interacted with Gcna in the SR strain but not with that in the ST strain. Gcna with amplified SprT-like domains likely targets transient TOP2-DPC on the Y chromosome and may disrupt or kill sperm harboring the Y chromosome; this was supported by the small number of sperm in the SR strain.

There is a general consensus that recognition of extrahelical extrusions or hairpin-loop structures (formed by strand slippage) by the DNA mismatch repair protein MutS beta leads to repeat expansion by a mutagenic repair process. By contrast, the FAN1 nuclease prevents triplet repeat expansion, the molecular basis of which was explained by our recent finding that FAN1 nuclease cleaves and initiates removal of extrahelical extrusions. We have proposed that competition for extrusion binding between FAN1 and MutS beta governs the outcome of the opposing effects of these two pathways. Here we show that extrusions containing 2-3 triplet repeats are recognized and processed by both FAN1 and MutS beta pathways. However, a single triplet extrusion escapes FAN1 cleavage and is exclusively processed by MutS beta-dependent MMR, leading to repeat expansion. Thus, the size of the extrahelical extrusions formed by strand slippage events affects the ultimate fate of the repeat elements, and controls the bias between repeat expansion or stability.

These tasks typically require learners to adjust learning rates dynamically in response to uncertainty, for instance, increasing learning from prediction errors in volatile environments. However, prior studies have produced inconsistent and sometimes contradictory findings regarding the nature and extent of learning impairments in populations with internalizing disorders. To address this, we conducted eight experiments (N = 820) using predictive inference and reversal learning tasks, and applied a bi-factor analysis to capture internalizing symptom variance shared across and differentiated between anxiety and depression. While we observed robust evidence for adaptive learning-rate modulation across participants, we found no convincing evidence of a systematic relationship between internalizing symptoms and either learning rates or task performance. These findings challenge prominent claims that learning difficulties are a hallmark feature of internalizing psychopathology and suggest that the relationship between these traits and adaptive behavior under uncertainty may be more subtle than previously thought.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

L.; Lau, C. G.", "abstract": "Bang-sensitive (BS) Drosophila mutants exhibit a stereotyped pattern of seizure behavior after mechanical disturbances. We previously identified mutations in the julius seizure (jus) gene, formerly CG14509, can induce BS seizures. However, the behavioral manifestations of the seizure phenotype of the various jus mutants have not been fully characterized. Here, we developed a machine learning pipeline featuring LASC (Long short-term memory and Attention mechanism for Sequence Classification) for automatic phenotyping of jus mutant videos. LASC achieves 90% classification accuracy in distinguishing five phases: paralysis (P), tonic seizure (T), spasm (S), clonic seizure (C), and recovery (R). Applying the trained LASC model to multiple jus lines showed they use a common repertoire of seizure stages and followed the general P[-&gt;]T[-&gt;]S[-&gt;]C[-&gt;]R progression, but each genotype exhibited unique patterns of stage duration and transition probabilities. Remarkably, stage usage patterns are distinct among the mutant genotypes. These findings establish that while all jus mutants adhere to stereotyped behavioral rules, each allele generates a distinct signature in stage usage. This work demonstrates how advanced behavioral quantification can reveal previously hidden relationships between gene mutation and complex motor outputs. More broadly, the complete pipeline presented here can pave the way for high-throughput, automated drug screening for epilepsy.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Instead, this uncoupling accelerates the acquisition of naive pluripotency during in vitro de-differentiation, revealing an unexpected link between transcription kinetics and cell plasticity. Mechanistically, we show that the transition to naive pluripotency is accompanied by a distinctive alternative splicing program indicative of reduced RNAPII elongation, both in vitro and in vivo.

For a trait to evolve it must be heritable, and although viral load--a proxy for disease severity--has been shown to be a heritable trait, it is surprising that specific heritable viral factors remain mostly elusive. Rapid within-host evolution is also expected to diminish heritability. We hypothesised that rather than a small number of mutations of large effect determining viral load, the number of slightly deleterious mutations could be key. As a proof of principle, we explored how viral load is expected to evolve within and between hosts using a nested modelling approach that links within-host evolution with epidemiological outcomes. For mutations of sufficiently small effect, a mutation-selection balance is gradually reached during infection, resulting in slow changes in viral load despite rapid rates of genomic evolution. In simulated epidemics, we generated realistic population distributions of viral loads and estimates of heritability. The existence of many slightly deleterious mutations provides a mechanism that can help to explain why viral loads change slowly during infection, broad distributions of viral loads among individuals, and why searches for viral factors that determine viral load have had limited success.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

However, the negatively charged outer leaflet of the plasma membrane poses challenges for the uptake of negatively charged DNA nanostructures. Strategies such as functionalizing DNA nanostructures with cationic lipids have been attempted, but these approaches have yielded conflicting results and certain limitations including stability and ambiguity of lipid functionalisation. Additionally, drug delivery using DNA tetrahedron (TD) and other conventional therapies has shown off-target effects due to the non-specificity of the drug. To address these challenges, this study utilizes a hydrophobic molecule, alpha-tocopherol succinate (AT), known for its selective cytotoxicity towards malignant cells over normal cells at appropriate concentrations. Covalently conjugating AT with TD preserved its selective toxicity property and enhance the cellular internalization of DNA tetrahedron in specific cell lines. ROS generation was increased and led to apoptosis in malignant cell lines specifically.

However, in in vivo experiments, its water insolubility becomes a significant obstacle. This study describes a promising method for the administration of betulin in in vivo experiments and the determination of betulin levels in organ samples. Methods: Betulin is dissolved first in ethanol, and this solution is introduced into acylglycerols, followed by evaporation of the ethanol. Olive oil and food-grade lard were determined to be suitable lipids for noninvasive application per os. A method for processing the organs of experimental animals for betulin determination was developed. Determination in blood is also likely the only viable option to be used in future clinical studies and practice. Results: The maximum amount of betulin usable (i.e., absorbable by organisms) in olive oil (10 mg/ml), suppository mass (6 mg/ml), food lard (4 mg/ml), and cocoa butter (2 mg/ml) carriers was found microscopically. A specific distribution of betulin concentration in the organs of experimental animals (Wistar rats) after a weekly diet containing betulin was discovered. The blood was shown to be particularly advantageous, as it allows continuous monitoring of betulin levels in the body. In these pilot experiments, a statistically significant (P < 0.001) synergistic effect of betulin on solid Ehrlich adenocarcinoma tumors was observed when betulin was combined with cytostatic Namitecan (NMRI mice). The high-purity betulin used in this study is very stable even under fluctuating storage conditions. Conclusions: Our study proves that both the method of betulin administration and the proposed analytical procedure could greatly increase the reliability and reproducibility of in vivo studies and future preclinical and clinical studies on the effects of betulin and possibly other similar water-insoluble triterpenoids on living organisms.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

While exteroceptive stimuli, such as food and drugs of abuse, are well-established activators of DA-neuron activity, growing evidence indicates that interoceptive signals also play a critical role in modulating reward. Among these, the gut-brain vagal axis has emerged as a key pathway, yet its precise contribution to mesolimbic DA-dependent signaling, dynamics and behaviors remains poorly defined. Here, we combine complementary ex vivo and in vivo approaches across multiple scales to investigate how the gut-brain vagal axis regulates DA dynamics and reward-related behaviors. We show that gut-brain vagal tone is essential for gating mesolimbic DA system activity and functions, modulating DA-dependent molecular and cellular processes, and scaling both food- and drugs-induced reinforcement. These findings challenge the traditional brain-centric view of reward processing, supporting a more unified and integrated model in which gut-derived and vagus-mediated interoceptive signals are pivotal in intrinsically shaping motivation and reinforcement.

Here, we set out to exploit nucleic acid isotope labelling coupled mass spectrometry (NAIL-MS) in a pulse chase set-up to study the in vivo function of ALKBH5 on human RNAs. For this we purified poly(A) from whole cell total RNA and found that, steady-state m6A levels and turnover dynamics were nearly identical between WT and ALKBH5 KO, despite clear evidence of robust RNA turnover within an 8-hour labeling period. To assess whether ALKBH5 might act in a compartment-specific manner, we employed an advanced subcellular fractionation strategy, allowing for the isolation of chromatin-associated, nucleoplasmic, and cytoplasmic RNA. These analyses confirmed that m6A accumulates during transcript maturation, with levels peaking in nuclear fractions and decreasing following export to the cytoplasm, supporting the thesis m6A is a dynamic modification. Notably, however, spatial and temporal profiles of m6A distribution and decay were unaffected by ALKBH5 KO. Even in chromatin-associated and nucleolar mRNA, where co-transcriptional modification and potential demethylation would be most plausible, m6A dynamics remained indistinguishable between WT and KO cells in the NAIL-MS context.

Our findings indicate that E2 enhances the expression of miR-146, miR-23, miR-21, miR-132, and miR-148-miRNAs known to support angiogenesis. Conversely, the decrease in the expression of miR-208 leads to a role in cardiac remodeling.

Unicellular relatives of animals exhibit simple multicellularity through clonal division, formation of multinucleate coenocytes, or aggregation. Therefore, animal multicellularity may have evolved from one (or a combination) of these behaviours. Aggregation has classically been dismissed as a means to complex multicellularity. However, aggregation occurs in many extant animal cells and has also been recently described in three different unicellular relatives of animals (the choanoflagellates Salpingoeca rosetta and Choanoeca flexa, and the filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki). It is unclear whether aggregation in these species is derived or ancestral, and its relevance for animal origins remains unknown. To fill this gap, we investigated whether an additional unicellular relative of animals can undergo aggregation. We discovered that the marine free-living bacterivorous filasterean Ministeria vibrans forms homogeneous aggregates with reproducible kinetics that have long-term stability when cultured with an alphaproteobacterium. We found that many multicellularity genes involved in animal cell adhesion, signalling, and transcriptional regulation were deployed during this process.

Despite this, the clinical implications of the prevalence of ARGs in these bacterial communities remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate how the abundance of ARGs in human gut and wastewater microbiomes reflects their dissemination among important bacterial pathogens. To do this, we estimated the abundance of >30,000 ARGs, including both well-known (established) and computationally predicted (latent) genes, in >6,000 metagenomic samples. From their prevalence in human gut and wastewater, we identified four major categories of ARGs: co-promoted, human gut (HG)-promoted, wastewater (WW)-promoted, and non-promoted. Our results showed that co-promoted ARGs were, by far, most promiscuous, with an increased frequency of being carried by multiple bacterial phyla, and higher co-localization with broad host range conjugative elements. Co-promoted ARGs were also found to be overrepresented among genes identified in multiple pathogenic species and exhibited an overall higher genetic compatibility, both with pathogens and other typical residents of the human gut and wastewater microbiomes.

Nevertheless, many widely-used analysis methods, such as analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and methods for estimating phylogenetic trees using nucleotide divergence (dXY) still lack the probabilistic frameworks necessary to accommodate GLs. Results: We introduce ngsAMOVA, a novel probabilistic framework for analyzing molecular variation in population hierarchies with low- and medium-depth sequencing data. It employs an Expectation Maximization algorithm to first estimate the joint genotype probabilities for pairs of individuals, accounting for genotype uncertainty using GLs. It then uses these estimates to generate a pairwise distance matrix, which can be used for AMOVA, estimation of dXY, and for estimating phylogenetic trees using Neighbor-Joining. Hypothesis testing is facilitated using genomic block-bootstrapping. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that ngsAMOVA provides more accurate results compared to genotype calling at low and medium read depths.

While functional near-infrared spectroscopy is a unique modality for measuring this index in dynamic, real-world interactions, methods to adequately assess inter-brain relationships have not been firmly established, and the overall picture remains unclear. Consequently, in this article, we first briefly summarize analysis methods for examining social interaction by dividing them into static and dynamic measures. Among these, we focus on measures of synchrony and their assessment in correlating behaviours, conducting a simulation-based comparison and analysis. Specifically, we directly compared static and dynamic variants of wavelet transform coherence (WTC), Pearson's correlation coefficient (CC), and phase mutual information (pMI) using a real fNIRS dataset. Results showed a significant divergence between WTC and CC, while WTC and pMI exhibited similar patterns as static measures. Overall, WTC was suggested to better identify synchrony due to its non-linear, instantaneous, and robust nature. For the latter part, based on other simulation analyses, we propose a new method using generalized linear model (GLM) regression. Simulations with synthetic fNIRS data supported the effectiveness of our proposed method, which can capture the dynamic relationships between inter-brain synchrony and behaviour, even during free interaction.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

The female and male genitalia of Drosophila offer an excellent opportunity to investigate homology and trait evolution, as fruit fly genital structures are developmentally tractable and evolve rapidly. While previous work has characterized gene regulatory networks operating in the development and evolution of male genital structures in Drosophila, female pupal genitalia are comparatively understudied. Here, we traced the development of female pupal genitalia to determine when and how individual structures form. We then measured the expression patterns of 29 transcription factors in both female and male genital structures at high resolution using the hybridization chain reaction and confocal microscopy.

V.; Ribeiro, E. D.; Ronco, F.; Vranken, N.; Oliver, M. K.; Salzburger, W.; Stiassny, M.; Benson, R.; Verd, B.", "abstract": "African cichlids comprise more than 1800 species of freshwater fishes, with remarkable adaptive radiations in Lakes Tanganyika, Malawi, and Victoria that have given rise to extraordinary morphological diversity. However, the evolution of the cichlid axial skeleton has been largely overlooked, despite its high variation and functional significance for locomotion. Here, we present the first macroevolutionary study of axial morphology in African cichlids, based on phylogenetic comparative analyses of 4861 individuals from 583 species. Adaptation to demersal, pelagic, and piscivorous niches has led to the evolution of elongate bodies with high vertebral counts in lacustrine cichlids, emphasising the role of the fusiform body shape in ecological adaptation. However, riverine species occupy a broader axial morphospace than lacustrine species, which is partly explained by a higher stochastic rate of vertebral count evolution in riverine lineages. In addition, the occupied axial morphospace broadly correlates with the estimated age of the lacustrine radiations, suggesting that exploration of axial morphospace is a function of divergence time. However, rates of vertebral count evolution are not the same across the lake radiations. Therefore, accumulated variation in vertebral counts (and more broadly axial morphospace) is not solely a function of divergence time. Finally, we show that the common ancestor of African cichlids possessed a distinctly riverine axial morphology, indicating that the exploration of axial morphospace radiated outward from this ancestral riverine form. These findings highlight the importance of a comparative approach to studying cichlid evolution and underscore the value of African cichlids as a model for investigating the evolutionary and developmental dynamics of the teleostean vertebral column.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Compared to mere genomic prediction models, PTB demonstrates superior performance when predicting yield in unseen environments across 48 year-locations in Europe. The model captures non-linear growth responses varying with phenological stages and identifies distinct patterns associated with yield performance and stability.

Targeting of CMTM6 was proposed as a strategy to decrease surface PD-L1 and trigger cytotoxicity against tumors. In accord, ablation of CMTM6 in mouse cancer models was shown to efficiently suppress tumor growth in a manner partially independent of PD-L1, which suggested that CMTM6 might regulate other proteins involved in anti-tumor immunity. Using mass spectrometry, we discovered that mouse CMTM6 strongly associates with the cell death receptor FAS and negatively regulates its expression in mice. Deletion of CMTM6 promotes FAS membrane localization and renders murine cells sensitive to FASL-mediated cytotoxicity. However, the interaction between CMTM6 and FAS is lost in human cells due to the difference in three amino acids at the boundary of the FAS extracellular and transmembrane domains. Altogether, our data urge caution when transferring promising data regarding the targeting of CMTM6 from mouse cancer models to potential human therapies.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

These delineations deliver further benefit when they encompass assessments of population vulnerability to extinction from pressures such as climate change. However, delineations and vulnerability assessments are particularly difficult within highly diverse species, such as the salmonid fish Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), that show extensive phenotypic and genetic variation within and across locations, variable and complex life histories, and broad geographic distributions. As yet, the nature and scope of Arctic charr diversity has not been characterised at the scale needed to delineate key conservation units in Scotland. To identify evolutionarily significant and vulnerable populations to prioritise conservation needs, we conducted a genomic study of Arctic charr populations across Britain and Ireland with a focus on Scottish populations (N=64 populations; 24,878 SNPs; 410 individuals). We found that most lake populations represented distinct genetic clusters, with limited gene flow between them resulting in high levels of genetic differentiation. Higher level groupings of genetic similarity across catchments likely reflect historic anadromy and migration, with populations primarily grouping east or west of the central watershed divide in Scotland. Analysing genetic offset, also known as genomic vulnerability, we identified strong inverse correlations between genetic vulnerability with latitude and distance to the sea suggesting that more southern and more inland populations are more vulnerable to loss due to climate change. Additionally, patterns of vulnerability across several additional metrics identified further populations that may be at high vulnerability to loss. We further used our genetic data, along with phenotypic and geographic information, to identify populations of greatest evolutionary significance. This highlighted the most important ones to protect are those in locations with multiple ecotypes, a key facet of functional Arctic charr biodiversity, and populations that are the only ones in their Hydrometric Area.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

However, its uniform interaction assumption and neglect of higher-order correlations limit its accuracy in predicting experimental B-factors and residue cross-correlations critical for understanding allostery and information transfer. This study introduces an information-theoretic enhancement to the GNM, incorporating mutual information-based corrections to the Kirchhoff matrix to account for multi-body interactions and contextual residue dynamics. By iteratively optimizing B-factor predictions and applying a Monte Carlo-driven maximum entropy approach to refine covariances, our method achieves significant improvements, reducing RMSDs between predicted and experimental B-factors by 26-46% across eight representative proteins. The model contextualizes residue assignments based on local density, secondary structure, solvent exposure, and allosteric roles, showing complex dynamic patterns beyond simple neighbor counts. Enhanced predictions of mutual information and entropy transfer in proteins like KRAS highlight improved capture of allosteric communication pathways. This evolvable framework, capable of incorporating additional effects and utilizing contextual residue assignments, enables precise studies of mutation effects on protein dynamics, with improved cross-correlation predictions potentially increasing accuracy in drug design and function prediction.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Although this \"cost of reproduction\" plays a pivotal role in theory on ageing and life-history evolution, the physiological mechanisms underlying it remain largely unresolved. As mitochondria synthesize 90% of the energy available to eukaryotic cells, their functioning may be crucial in mediating the cost of reproduction. In this study, we therefore experimentally manipulated the reproductive status (gamete production) of male and female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), and tested for effects on mitochondrial respiration. We found that reproduction led to an overall increase in mitochondrial O2 consumption in females. This was primarily driven by a large increase in proton leak, as O2 consumption for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis only increased slightly. Hence, reproductively active females had a severely reduced efficiency in ATP production, compared to non-reproductive females. In males, mitochondrial respiration and its efficiency were unaffected by reproduction, and similar to that in non-reproductive females. We suggest the large increase in proton leak in reproductive females to represent an adaptive mechanism to mitigate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and to be an unavoidable consequence of elevated ATP synthesis. The latter would cause constraints on energy availability for reproductive females, and thereby trade-offs with other energy demanding processes, like somatic maintenance. The absence of effects of reproduction on male mitochondrial respiration confirms the general view that gamete production is less costly for males.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

K.; Hedberg, J.; Hernandez Aguirre, I.; Saini, U.; Kim, D.; Kim, Y.; Dhital, R.; Cassady, K.

Oncolytic HSVs (oHSV) are promising immunotherapeutics capable of selectively lysing cancer cells, eliciting anti-tumor immunity, and providing local delivery of immune-activating transgenes. IL-27 is a pleiotropic cytokine capable of enhancing tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cell (CTL) function while also possessing neuroprotective properties. We hypothesized that IL-27 expression by oHSV would enhance CTL function and improve anti-glioma therapeutic activity. Methods We developed an oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) that expresses IL-27 (C027). The anti-glioma efficacy of C027 was tested in three syngeneic orthotopic glioma models derived from both chemical (CT-2A) and genetic (SB28, KR158) glioma lines. Spectral flow cytometry was used to assess immunophenotypic and functional changes in the tumor infiltrates and systemically. To further investigate the C027-related CTL activity, we employed in vivo cell specific depletion and IL-27 blockade alongside in vitro T cell stimulation assays. Local and systemic antitumor memory was evaluated by both orthotopic and flank tumor rechallenge of C027-treated long-term survivors. Results C027 significantly prolonged survival in syngeneic orthotopic glioma models derived from both chemical (CT-2A) and genetic (KR158, SB28) glioma lines. In the CT-2A model, IL-27-expressing oHSV treatment was associated with increased intratumoral multifunctional effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and functional T cell populations systemically. Mechanistically, both CD8 T cells and IL-27 were required for the C027 survival benefit in vivo and IL-27 enhanced CTL function in vitro. C027-treated mice that survived their initial tumors had local and systemic anti-glioma memory rejecting tumors on rechallenge. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that IL-27 expression by oHSV significantly improves anti-glioma therapeutic efficacy, enhances CTL effector function, and induces durable immune memory. Thus, IL-27-oHSV may provide a promising therapeutic approach for malignant gliomas.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation is the cornerstone for liver fibrosis and influenced by multiple factors, such as viral infection, hepatocellular injury, chronic immune activation, gut mucosal barrier dysfunction, and microbial translocation. Unlike gram-negative bacterial products, the impact of gram-positive microbial products in Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV-1) associated liver inflammation and fibrosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effect of lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a major gram-positive bacterial component, on HSCs in the context of HIV-1 infection. Methods: Human HSCs were isolated from the livers of both non-HIV and HIV-infected patients undergoing hepatic resection. The inflammatory responses of HSCs to LTA stimulation were measured by ELISA before or after HIV-1BaL ex vivo expision. Western blotting, ChIP-qPCR and RNA-seq were used to reveal the mechanisms contributing to the IL-8 response to LTA stimulation and HIV-1BaL exposure in HSCs. Results: While LTA stimulation modestly increased IL-8 production in HSCs, this effect was significantly amplified in HIV-1-infected HSCs. Elevated IL-8 levels were detected in HIV-1+ liver sections, and IL-8 treatment of cultured HSCs significantly increased -SMA and COL1A1 expression, supporting IL-8 as a key inflammatory driver of liver fibrosis in HIV-1+ individuals. Transcriptomic analyses implicated histone acetylation as a regulator of the enhanced IL-8 response of HSCs to LTA in HIV-1 infection. Consistent with this, treatment with Trichostatin A (TSA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, further increased the IL-8 response in HIV-1-infected HSCs. ChIP-qPCR confirmed that histone H4K5 acetylation facilitated IL-8 promoter transactivation, rendering HIV-1-infected cells more responsive to LTA. Conclusions: HIV-1 infection sensitizes HSCs to LTA stimulation, leading to an amplified IL-8 response mediated through histone acetylation that may accelerate liver fibrosis progression in PLWH. As microbial translocation persists despite effective antiretroviral therapy, these findings underscore the need for targeted strategies to mitigate liver fibrosis in HIV-1 infected HIV-1+ individuals.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular maturity of this model has not yet been assessed, and there is currently no method to extract proteins from micropatterned hiPSC-CMs for top-down proteomic analysis. Herein, we present a high-sensitivity, surfactant-free protein extraction protocol for the top-down proteomic analysis of hiPSC-CMs. Through this method, we assessed the maturation of micropatterned hiPSC-CMs compared to traditional unstructured monoculture and co-culture monolayers at the proteoform level. We found that micropatterned hiPSC-CMs display molecular signatures of cardiomyocyte maturations including increased expression of ventricular myosin light chain isoforms, reduced expression of the fetal troponin T isoform, and decreased phosphorylation of alpha-tropomyosin.

Here, we use wormPOP to simulate C. elegans population dynamics with changing culling parameters and calculate the largest Lyapunov Exponents of the simulated populations. The agent-based model wormPOP is a realistic simulation based on a laboratory population system with C. elegans and its food source E. coli. Our results show that depending on the percentage of culling, populations can exhibit chaotic or periodic behavior.

Importantly, inoculation of these MSA-like EVs in animal models induces robust pSer129-alpha-synuclein accumulation along the nigrostriatal axis, colocalizing with markers of mature oligodendrocytes and dopaminergic neurons. These findings underscore the pivotal role of oligodendroglial-derived EVs in pathology progression and neuronal-oligodendroglial communication, positioning them as promising targets for therapeutic strategies aimed at combating alpha-synucleinopathies.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "Mitochondria are diverse and multifaceted intracellular organelles regulating oxidative energy supply, lipid metabolism and calcium (Ca2+) signaling. In neurons the spatial sequestration of cytoplasmic Ca2+ by mitochondria plays a critical role in determining activity-dependent spine plasticity, shaping the presynaptic transmitter release characteristics and contributing to sustained action potential firing. Here, we tested the hypothesis that mitochondria at the axon initial segment (AIS) affect the microdomain cytoplasmic Ca2+ transients, thereby regulating Ca2+-dependent voltage-gated ion channels at the plasma membrane and initiation of action potentials. Using 3D electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions and virally injecting genetically encoded fluorescence indicators we visualized the ultrastructure and distribution of mitochondria selectively in thick-tufted layer 5 pyramidal neurons. We found that most mitochondria were stably clustered to the proximal AIS, while few were observed at distal sites. Simultaneous two-photon imaging of action potential-dependent cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca2+, combined with electrophysiological recordings showed the AIS mitochondria exhibit powerful activity-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ uptake. However, while intracellular application of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter inhibitor Ru360 fully blocked mitochondrial Ca2+ import, it did not affect action potential input-output function, action potential dynamics nor the ability to produce high-frequency burst output. Together, the results indicate that AIS mitochondria are dispensable for temporal and rate encoding, suggesting that mt-Ca2+ buffering at the AIS may be involved in non-electrical roles, including AIS maintenance or axonal transport.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

N.", "abstract": "A key challenge in analyzing neuroscience datasets is the profound variability they exhibit across sessions, animals, and data modalities--i.e., heterogeneity. Several recent studies have demonstrated performance gains from pretraining neural foundation models on multi-session datasets, seemingly overcoming this challenge. However, these studies typically lack fine-grained data scaling analyses. It remains unclear how different sources of heterogeneity influence model performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, and whether all sessions contribute equally to downstream performance gains. In this work, we systematically investigate how data heterogeneity impacts the scaling behavior of neural data transformers (NDTs) in neural activity prediction. We found that explicit sources of heterogeneity, such as brain region mismatches among sessions, reduced scaling benefits of neuron- and region-level activity prediction performances. For tasks that do exhibit consistent scaling, we identified implicit data heterogeneity arising from cross-session variability. Through our proposed session-selection procedure, models pretrained on as few as five selected sessions outperformed those pretrained on the entire dataset of 84 sessions. Our findings challenge the direct applicability of traditional scaling laws to neural data and suggest that prior claims of multi-session scaling benefits may be premature. This work both highlights the importance of incremental data scaling analyses and suggests new avenues toward optimally selecting pretraining data when developing foundation models on large-scale neuroscience datasets.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we provide methods to perform automated high-throughput patch-clamp (APC) on hiPSC-derived neurons. We describe how to dissociate and perform voltage-clamp recordings on human neurons from three well-established protocols - 2D directed differentiation of cortical neurons, NGN2-induced neurons, and 3D cortical organoids - using the Nanion Syncropatch 384, a commercially available high-throughput APC system. Using this approach, we investigated the biophysical properties of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) and provide direct comparisons between manual and APC recordings across all three hiPSC-derived model systems. We demonstrate the capability of this automated system for pharmacological analysis of native human VGSC isoforms, which will enable compound screening approaches. Lastly, we provide methods to sort specific cellular populations within these hiPSC models using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) followed by APC.

Mapping mesoscale neural circuitry is done using injections of tracers that label groups of neurons whose axons project to different brain regions. Since many neurons are labeled, it is difficult to follow individual axons. Previous approaches have instead quantified the regional projections using the total label intensity within a region. However, such a quantification is not biologically meaningful. We propose a new approach better connected to the underlying neurons by skeletonizing labeled axon fragments and then estimating a volumetric length density. Our approach uses a combination of deep nets and the Discrete Morse (DM) technique from computational topology. This technique takes into account nonlocal connectivity information and therefore provides noise-robustness. We demonstrate the utility and scalability of the approach on whole-brain tracer injected data. We also define and illustrate an information theoretic measure that quantifies the additional information obtained, compared to the skeletonized tracer injection fragments, when individual axon morphologies are available. Our approach is the first application of the DM technique to computational neuroanatomy. It can help bridge between single-axon skeletons and tracer injections, two important data types in mapping neural networks in vertebrates.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Optimized ink formulations are developed for conductive nanocarbon microelectrodes, and furthermore, fluoropolymer (polytetrafluoroethylene-based AF2400) ink has been inkjet printed for the first time acting as an insulator layer for microelectrodes. To keep the biocompatible nanoporous structure of culture wells, the microelectrodes have been printed on the bottom of the culture cells and only small connector pads have been produced on top of the culture membrane. Neural activity has been recorded by such a microelectrode structure for rodent brain slices cultured for three weeks.

Leveraging naturalistic fMRI combined with gradient mapping techniques, the present study investigated FPN functional dedifferentiation-quantified by functional dispersion of FPN in the multidimension gradient manifold-during real-life emotional experiences and its link to affective outcomes. Here, we estimated functional dispersion during naturalistic movie watching in both younger (N=72, 34 female, 19-36 yrs) and older (N=68, 36 female, 65-82 yrs) adult groups with 7T MRI scanner and assessed their emotion regulation difficulties, anxiety, and depression symptoms as indicators of mental health status. The results demonstrated that greater FPN dispersion (i.e., more dissimilar connectivity) was linked to increased depressive symptoms in older adults and highlighted emotion regulation difficulties as a full mediator of this relationship. Moreover, FPN dispersion could distinguish emotionally resilient from vulnerable older individuals. These findings suggest that functional dedifferentiation of the FPN during ecologically valid emotional context constitutes a promising neural signature of affective vulnerability in older adults. By bridging age-related functional dedifferentiation to real-world emotional scenario, this work underscores the translational value of naturalistic paradigms in geriatric psychiatry and identifies potential intervention targets aimed at enhancing FPN specificity to promote mental health in aging population.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Using a common garden experiment, we test whether differential transcriptomic responses to thermal stress between shallow and mesophotic populations of Corallium rubrum are shaped by their adaptation to the local environment, i.e. local adaptation. Six individuals from one shallow (15m) and one mesophotic (48m) population were exposed to control (18{degrees}C) and thermal stress (25{degrees}C) treatments, with samples collected at day 0 (T0), day 5 (T5), and day 10 (T10) for RNA sequencing (N=36). We revealed 1,957 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to heat stress. Mild transcriptomic responses were observed in the shallow population (441 DEGs) characterized by heat shock proteins (HSPs) and developmental regulation. Conversely, a stronger and extensive response was observed in the mesophotic population with more than twice as many DEGs (1,081), predominantly associated with enhanced stress and wound healing mechanisms. Temporal transcriptional shifts were larger between T5 to T10 in the mesophotic population (1,497 vs 241), while more stable in the shallow (265 vs 271). Additionally, 172 DEGs, including HSPs, apoptosis and collagen, were found in the shallow population under control conditions, indicating transcriptional frontloading. The contrasting thermal stress responses between populations suggest distinct adaptative strategies potentially driven by local adaptation. These insights challenge the deep refugia hypothesis that considered mesophotic populations as potential sources for recolonization and active restoration of shallow populations threatened by MHWs. Our results support the need to integrate population-specific adaptive responses into conservation and restoration strategies for C. rubrum.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Hosts may adapt to their local microbiomes (or vice versa), and hosts may depend on microbiomes for adaptation to the local environment. Using Lemna minor (duckweed) as a model organism, we examined differences in host fitness when grown in local and nonlocal microbiomes and in local and nonlocal water.

Part of this evolutionary process can involve specialization, when viruses adapt to increase their fitness on a particular host, often at the expense of their ability to infect other hosts. This trajectory has the potential to lead to extreme host narrowing which excludes all other previously accessible hosts. The consequences of the genetic architecture of host specialization on a virus's future evolutionary potential are understudied. In this study, we explored the ability of extreme specialists to re-expand their host ranges, particularly the ease and mutational mechanisms by which they might accomplish this such as reversion of host-range-narrowing mutations or mutations at other sites. Using previously evolved specialized strains of model dsRNA bacteriophage phi6 which had lost their ability to infect some hosts, we challenged specialists to adapt to their ancestral and other challenge hosts and identified resulting mutations. We found that these specialists readily re-gained their broader host ranges, at rates comparable to previously observed emergence events in phi6, indicating a lack of potential constraint from their mutational backgrounds due to epistasis. While some viral strains achieved host range re-expansion by reversing the original host-narrowing mutations gained during specialization, others used secondary mutations which were found to be parallel mutations previously associated with phi6 entry into those host species. This study contributes to our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of host shifting in RNA viruses and their strategies to re-expand following specialization, which is relevant to spillback events and recurring host shifts that are observed in nature.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Here, we re-port a multiplex disposable photonic biosensor for simultaneous measurement of enzyme activity and concentration. Capture of the enzyme by a ring resonator-bound antibody produces a red shift in resonance, which can be referenced to a nonspecific binding control. At the same time, enzyme-mediated degradation of a ring-bound substrate produces a resonance blue shift, which can be referenced to a peptide inert to enzymatic cleavage. We tested the dual assay with human Cathepsin-L, dysfunc-tion of which is a hallmark of several diseases, including COVID-19, kidney failure, and cancer.

While there are multiple software tools to support this process, it is still mainly driven by domain experts manually curating quality reports. This time-consuming effort is expected to increase with the future capacity to generate more sequencing samples, at lower costs, using advanced technologies. By leveraging quality-labelled data from large databases and automatically created quality-related features derived from raw sequencing samples, supervised machine learning shows great potential for supporting quality assessment, as shown by the seqQscorer tool. This tool shows outstanding results for automated quality assessment and has been used to investigate several quality-related aspects, integrating large-scale sequencing datasets. To improve seqQscorer in terms of accuracy and processing time, we explored the potential of creating features that are more informative and faster in generation than those conventionally used by seqQscorers models. For this purpose, we used the ENCODE blocklist*, a set of problematic genomic regions known to be related to the quality of NGS data. Results: Our results show that we can improve the quality assessment for ChIP-seq samples derived from human tissues and cell lines when using features based on the ENCODE blocklist by up to 4.4%, when using a generic dataset containing single-end and paired-end sequencing samples. For other assays, these new blocklist features allow for highly accurate quality assessment, in general, but are less accurate in comparison to using the conventional seqQscorer features. Outlook: These results strongly encourage an extension of the seqQscorer tool that automatically integrates the new blocklist features. Users investigating human protein-DNA interactions would benefit from this extension, as it not only improves model performance during quality assessment but also enhances usability by simplifying the installation procedure and reducing the computational resources required for feature generation.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

To address this challenge, we integrated machine learning (ML) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the trade offs between pharmacodynamic (PD) and PK properties in Mpro inhibitor design. We developed ML models to classify Mpro inhibitors based on experimental IC50 data, combining molecular descriptors with structural insights from MD simulations.

To identify potential effectors for synergistic activation in bacteria, we systematically characterized bacterial activator proteins with a set of engineered synthetic promoters. We found that optimal target sites for different activators could vary by up to 200 bases in the region upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). These optimal target sites qualitatively matched previous reports for each activator, but the precise targeting rules varied between different promoters.

Here we show that magnetic fields affect expression of the neuronal activity marker c-Fos in the mouse retina in a light dependent manner. These retinal responses to magnetic fields are abolished in mice lacking the candidate magnetoreceptor cryptochrome. To characterise the signalling pathways involved, we then used RNAseq and cell-type mapping.

No effective treatment options currently exist for LC-related cognitive dysfunction. Here, we use the IntelliCage, which is an automated tracking system of cognitive functions, following SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice, measuring the ability of each mouse within a group to perform tasks that mimic complex human behaviors, such as planning, decision-making, cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Artificial intelligence and machine learning analyses of the tracking data classified LC mice into distinct behavioral categories from non-infected control mice, permitting precise identification and quantification of complex cognitive dysfunction in a controlled, replicable manner. Importantly, we find that brains from LC mice with cognitive dysfunction exhibit transcriptomic alterations similar to those observed in humans suffering from LC-related cognitive impairments, including altered expression of genes involved in learning, executive functions, synaptic functions, neurotransmitters and memory.

Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in the thymus contribute to recovery of thymic development after irradiation owing to their greater tolerance to irradiation compared to conventional thymocytes. However, whether and how iNKT cell development recovers from irradiation remains unknown. Here we show that iNKT cells in the thymus exhibits much slower post-irradiation recovery than conventional thymocytes. We compared T cell receptor (TCR) alpha chain repertoire of the thymus in 42 days after irradiation and quantified the sustained decline in the number of iNKT cells against other thymocytes. We found that fluctuation of V and J genes usage does not correlate with the number iNKT cells suggesting that differentiation process of iNKT cells after TCR gene rearrangement is impaired by irradiation. Mathematical modelling of recovery dynamics of iNKT cells implied that lack of rapid proliferation immediately after irradiation unlike conventional thymocytes contributes to the prolonged reduction of iNKT cell population. These findings may suggest possibility on association between the prolonged reduction of iNKT cells after irradiation and autoimmune diseases caused by irradiation in bone marrow transplantation.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Our results showed no significant evidence of pre-stress UV tolerance. Instead, the data suggest that survival is primarily driven by inducible DNA repair responses activated after UV exposure.

However, the bioavailability of these dietary nutrients to the microbiota is likely limited due to entrapment within the grain particle and requires liberation by microbial enzymes. Here, we used batch fecal fermentation from mixed donors on a range of sizes of wheat particles generated by cyclone milling from a single source to identify bacterial taxa and genomic signatures that are responsive to differences in wheat bran fine structures. We present evidence that different taxa within the same genus colonize wheat bran particles of different sizes. Further, neutral sugar content varied across wheat bran particles despite originating from the same batch, suggesting different polysaccharide structures and nutritional niches. In line with the taxonomic and compositional differences, specific short chain fatty acids varied across particle sizes; in fine wheat bran particle fermentations propionate was high and butyrate low. To identify relevant genomic features implicated in bran colonization, we took a metagenomic approach. From this, we linked genes associated with polysaccharide fermentation to wheat bran particles independent of size, however, within one well-distributed taxon, Lachnospiraceae, genes related to motility were linked to large and medium wheat bran particles.

Central to this machinery is the sorting platform (SP), a cytosolic assembly whose core scaffolding protein, SpaO, is produced in two isoforms: a full-length (SpaOL) and a shorter variant (SpaOshort) comprising the C-terminal 101 residues of SpaOL. Although SpaOshort is evolutionarily conserved across type III secretion systems, its precise function has remained elusive. Here, we combined a sensitive, real-time translocation assay with site-directed photo-crosslinking to elucidate the role of SpaOshort in Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS. We found that while SpaOshort is not absolutely required for effector secretion, its absence significantly dampens T3SS-mediated protein delivery. Further biochemical and structural probing revealed that SpaOshort is a structural component of the sorting platform, arranged as a homodimer associated to SpaOL via an N-terminal \"docking motif.\" This interaction occurs while SpaOL is associated with other SP components, supporting a model in which SpaOshort is integrated into the SP pods alongside SpaOL, OrgA, and OrgB.

K.; Wilt, I.; Majdoul, S.; Jolley, A. A.; Lewinski, M.; Compton, A. A.", "abstract": "The viral accessory protein Nef is a major determinant of HIV-1 pathogenicity in vivo. Nef is a multifunctional, immunomodulatory protein that downmodulates cell surface proteins, including CD4 and MHC class I (MHC-I) important for T-cell-mediated immunity. In addition, Nef also regulates cell-intrinsic immunity. Nef boosts the infectivity of virions produced and released from HIV-infected cells, at least in part, by counteracting the antiviral activity of transmembrane proteins SERINC3 and SERINC5. However, it has been reported that the enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity by Nef persists in certain cell lines deficient for SERINC3/5, revealing the existence of other Nef-sensitive host factors that impact HIV-1 infectivity. Here, we show that Nef proteins, especially those derived from many primary isolates of HIV-1, restore infectivity in interferon-treated cells and confer resistance to interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3). IFITM3 is a restriction factor that reduces retroviral infectivity by incorporating into virions, inhibiting Envelope glycoprotein function, and reducing entry into cells. Using a primary isolate of Nef derived from HIV-1 clade C, we found that Nef interacts with IFITM3 in membranes and uses the endocytic adaptor protein AP-2 to counteract it. Furthermore, Nef reduced IFITM3 cell surface levels, increased IFITM3 levels in early endosomes, and reduced IFITM3 incorporation into HIV-1 virions. Nef also impaired IFITM3 oligomerization and restored membrane fluidity in IFITM3-expressing cells. The antiviral activity of IFITM3 and its inhibition by Nef were unaffected by SERINC5 knockdown, suggesting that the counteraction of IFITM3 represents a unique function of Nef. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized immunomodulatory role for Nef in the setting of the interferon-induced antiviral state during HIV-1 infection.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

We generated Gars1{Delta}WHEP mutant mice lacking exon 2, which disrupts most of the WHEP domain. Homozygous Gars1{Delta}WHEP/{Delta}WHEP mice exhibited late embryonic or neonatal lethality, with delayed lung development, characterized by reduced airway dilation (inflatability), and increased vascular leakage. Disruption of the WHEP domain did not impair tRNA aminoacylation but inhibited the free release of GlyRS from cells. Instead, GlyRS{Delta}WHEP was found in the membrane fractions and showed a stronger interaction with the extracellular region of neuropilin 1 (Nrp1) receptor compared to full-length GlyRS. This aberrant interaction enhanced Nrp1's endocytic activity and significantly reduced the localization of the Nrp1 interactor VE-cadherin at the adherens junctions of endothelial cells. A heterozygous knockout of Nrp1 in the Gars1{Delta}WHEP/{Delta}WHEP mice partially rescued body weight and vascular permeability defects.

Using microscopy, roadblocking qPCR, and transcriptomics, we studied mitochondrial transcription in cells subjected to glucose deprivation, which is known to cause nuclear transcription downregulation and to activate the unfolded protein response (UPR). We found that glucose deprivation stabilizes mitochondrial RNAs and slows mitochondrial transcription, effects that are quickly reversed with glucose reintroduction.

Kinship matrices, also known as Genetic Relatedness Matrices or \"GRMs\", are required for heritability estimation with variance components models. However, the most common \"standard\" kinship estimator employed by GCTA and other approaches, can be severely biased in structured populations. In this study, we characterize heritability estimation biases in GCTA due to kinship estimation biases under population structure. For the standard ratio-of-means (ROM) kinship estimator, we derive a closed-form expression for heritability bias given by the mean kinship value and the true heritability. The standard mean-of-ratios (MOR) estimator is the most widely used in practice, and exhibits more severe bias than ROM due to upweighing low-frequency variants. Using simulation studies with admixture and family structures, as well as simulated traits from 1000 Genomes genotypes, we find that only Popkin, which is the only unbiased population kinship estimator, produces unbiased heritability estimates in structured settings. Pedigree-only estimates have upward heritability biases when there is population structure. Finally, we analyze three structured datasets with real phenotypes---the San Antonio Family Study, the Hispanic Community Health Study / Study of Latinos, and a multiethnic Nephrotic Syndrome cohort. The standard MOR estimator can produce both downward and upward heritability biases depending on population structure and variant frequency spectrum, compared to the other two estimators.

KRAB zinc finger proteins (KZFPs), a large family of transcription factors specialized in TE recognition, are known repressors of TE-derived regulatory activity through TRIM28-mediated H3K9me3 deposition. Here, we expand this paradigm by uncovering noncanonical relationships between TEs and KZFPs. By generating a comprehensive epigenomic map of KZFP-bound TEs, we find that the regulatory activity of ancient mammalian L2/MIR elements is broadly delineated by KZFP binding patterns, despite low H3K9me3 enrichment. We further dissect this relationship by investigating the function of ZNF436, a non-canonical KZFP, highly expressed during in vivo human fetal heart development. Using loss-of-function approaches, we show that ZNF436 preserves cardiomyocyte function by promoting cardiac gene expression while restricting the activation of alternative lineage programs. Mechanistically, ZNF436 recruits specialized SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes to limit the accessibility of L2/MIR-derived enhancers, many of which are active in non-cardiac tissues.

Little is understood about the regulatory mechanisms of replication stress recovery, including the mechanisms involved in the restart of stalled replication forks. Here, we identify the oncogenic phosphatase PPM1D/WIP1 as a critical regulator of replication fork restart. Upon recovery from replication stress, PPM1D prevents excessive MRE11- and DNA2-dependent nucleolytic degradation of stalled forks. Loss of PPM1D function leads to defects in RAD51 recruitment to chromatin and impairs RAD51-dependent fork restart. Phosphoproteomic analysis reveals that PPM1D regulates a network of ATM substrates, several of which are phosphorylated at an S/T-Q-(E/D)n motif. Strikingly, inhibition of ATM suppresses the deleterious consequences of impaired PPM1D function at replication forks, enabling timely fork restart. The dominant effect of ATM hyper-signaling in suppressing fork restart occurs, in part, through the excessive engagement of 53BP1 and consequent RAD51 antagonization. These findings uncover a new mode of ATM signaling responding to fork stalling and highlights the need for PPM1D to restrain ATM signaling and enable proper fork restart.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the biochemical and functional relevance of CAMKK2 isoforms, LF and SF, in the context of glucose metabolism.

Our results show that the GEM-simulated feasible flux space is constrained to a biologically meaningful region, allowing an exploration of the basic organizing principles of the feasible flux space.

H.; Barbier, M.", "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is an important opportunistic pathogen that has many virulence factors expressed in a coordinated manner to cause infection. External appendages, such as the type IV pili (T4P), can be used for signal transduction changing gene expression using a mechanism termed mechanosensing. An important role for the minor pilin, PilY1, is to signal that the bacterium has attached to a surface such as a host cell. This mechanosensing is important for triggering changes in bacterial gene expression allowing colonization of host tissues. In this study, we identify new PilY1-controlled genes and demonstrate the importance of PilY1 in controlling second messengers, including cAMP. Genetic analysis showed that PilY1 is important in controlling cAMP levels by regulating the expression of the main adenylate cyclase, cyaB. PilY1 also controls the expression of PA4781 a putative cyclic di-GMP phosphodiesterase. PilY1 also controls the expression of the algZ/R operon by preventing autoregulation of this system. Furthermore, the minor pilin PilY1 functions in different P. aeruginosa strains, including mucoid strains, demonstrating conservation of function. Surprisingly, bacterial survival in the lung, liver, and blood did not require PilY1. Overall, these findings suggest that PilY1 is critical for regulating second messengers by preventing the AlgZ/R system from functioning. Our work provides insight into the mechanisms that P. aeruginosa uses to modulate second messengers which are important in biofilm formation and virulence.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Despite the availability of few vaccines, no antiviral drugs are currently licensed for the treatment of orthoflavivirus infections. Several pre-clinical studies identified the non-structural protein 4B (NS4B), one of the least characterized viral proteins within the orthoflavivirus genus, as the most promising target for the development of potent direct-acting antivirals. However, its functional roles in viral replication are still elusive. Here, we employ an integrated proteomic approach to systematically identify cellular targets of NS4B across eight prototypic orthoflaviviruses and characterize their influence on the human proteome. Using this approach, we mapped high-confidence NS4B-interacting human proteins across the genus, underlying potentially divergent mechanisms of host adaptation across orthoflaviviruses spanning diverse pathologies and vector preferences. Among these, we unveil a novel function for UBA5, the E1-activating enzyme of the UFMylation pathway, in orthoflavivirus replication. Mechanistically, we map associations of distinct viral proteins with multiple members of the UFMylation pathway, which are selectively recruited to sites of viral replication to promote mitochondrial respiration. Finally, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of UFMylation exerts potent antiviral activity in vitro and in vivo. This integrative study provides a rational framework for a system-level understanding of orthoflavivirus NS4B effector functions and sheds light on a conserved and unconventional role for UFMylation in orthoflavivirus replication.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

This phenomenon is traditionally attributed to the activity of its two Type III Secretion Systems (T3SS) and their associated effectors. A critical challenge for these bacteria is acquiring nutrients from inside the host cell. Thus, they modulate the metabolism of host cells to replicate. Given the metabolic plasticity of macrophages, a key unresolved question is how their metabolic heterogeneity shapes intracellular Salmonella replication. By using human primary macrophages and live-cell imaging to monitor bacterial dynamics at the single-cell level, we revealed that Salmonella does not replicate in all infected cells. However, supplementation with specific carbon sources used by Salmonella during infection accelerated bacterial replication and increased the proportion of macrophages showing replicative bacteria. Remarkably, this occurred even in the absence of functional T3SSs, as a {Delta}prgH/ssaV double mutant was able to replicate in a subset of infected cells under favorable nutrient conditions. These phenotypes are further amplified in macrophages with higher glycolytic activity, such as the murine RAW 264.7 cell line. Further analyses demonstrated that enhanced Salmonella replication is not strictly dependent on host glycolytic activity but is instead driven by the ability of the host cell to take up the nutrients Salmonella prefers for its replication early during infection. In summary, our findings suggest that the dependence of Salmonella on its T3SSs for intracellular replication can be bypassed when host cells provide optimal access to key nutrients and highlight the impact of metabolic heterogeneity in shaping intracellular bacterial replication during infection of macrophages.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

The HDAC3 corepressor complex plays fundamental roles in these mechanisms, with the homologous subunits SMRT and NCOR being critical for complex assembly and interactions with transcription factors and chromatin. However, the relative contribution of SMRT and NCOR in controlling complex-dependent macrophage pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we assessed their genome-wide roles in mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells and in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Transcriptome analysis upon corepressor depletion identified six differentially expressed gene clusters. SMRT depletion primarily upregulated inflammation-related pathways, NCOR depletion primarily upregulated metabolism-related pathways. Epigenome analysis revealed that corepressor depletion differentially altered chromatin accessibility and H3K27 acetylation, consistent with transcriptome changes. Cistrome analysis revealed that both corepressors differentially influence each other at chromatin. SMRT uniquely controls the chromatin binding and nuclear localization of NCOR, GPS2 and HDAC3, thus acting as the chromatin anchor for the corepressor complex. Finally, corepressor depletion differentially modulated macrophage reprogramming in response to TLR4, IL4 and LXR signaling.

Terrestrial isopods, particularly the common pill bug Armadillidium vulgare, provide an excellent model for investigating these processes due to the rapid turnover in sex-determination mechanisms they undergo. In A. vulgare, multiple genetic determinants coexist. Notably, a feminizing factor is transmitted at a rate exceeding Mendelian expectations, resulting in female-biased populations. Some lineages possess a masculinizing allele at a locus referred to as the \"M gene\", which is functionally analogous to an XY system. Its masculinizing dominant allele is hypothesized to have been selected due to the deficit of males caused by the feminizing factor. The existence of the M gene was inferred from crosses carried out in the 1990s, but its molecular nature remains unresolved. Here, we conducted a genome-wide SNP analysis combining pooled sequencing of male and female progenies with sequencing of individual parents across two families. Bayesian estimation of haplotype frequencies in progenies enabled us to delimit a candidate genomic region of approximately two megabases containing 34 annotated genes. Most notably, one of these genes encodes the androgenic gland hormone, a protein involved in male sexual differentiation. Our findings lay the groundwork for detailed genetic and functional investigations of the M gene, offering novel insights into the dynamics of sex determination in terrestrial isopods and into the turnover of sex chromosomes in response to sex-ratio distortion.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

The previous structure of full-length CHIP identified an asymmetric homodimer in which one U-box is occluded from E2 binding, indicating an unusual half-of-sites activity. However, the flexibility of CHIP has complicated efforts to further characterize its structure and function. Here we leverage two CHIP-targeting fragment antigen-binding (Fab) antibodies to solve structures by cryo-EM. We identify one Fab binds to the CHIP U-box via interactions mimicking E2 contacts and stabilizes three distinct CHIP dimer states, revealing an asymmetric-to-symmetric conformational switch that would enable both U-box domains to be accessible for E2 binding. Conversely, the second Fab targets the CHIP coiled-coil domains, stabilizing the asymmetric dimer with a single accessible U-box. Remarkably, the Fabs exhibit opposing effects on CHIP-driven inhibition of tau aggregation, wherein binding to coiled-coil domains abolishes inhibition of aggregation, while binding to the U-box greatly potentiates this activity.

As the major template of viral transcription, the covalently closed circular DNAs (cccDNAs) of HBV was known to form microchromosomes and interact with various host proteins. In the present study, ZNF638 was found to significantly reduce the transcription of HBV into pgRNAs, and subsequently reduce cccDNA formation and viral propagation. We discovered that ZNF638 was able to bind the preS and S gene regions of HBV, repressing the transcription of cccDNA upon increased modification of H3K9me3 mediated by SETDB1. This epigenetic silencing of cccDNA transcription was further demonstrated to involve the activity of HUSH, a multi-protein complex to mediate epigenetic modifications of histone into suppressed nucleosomes. In in vivo models, we evaluated the effects of ZNF638 deficiency on HBV-targeting siRNA therapy. A significant reduction of the efficacy was observed in animals with reduced ZNF638 expression. In summary, we report that ZNF638 is a potent host factor to repress the transcription of HBV DNAs and to attenuate HBV infection. The role of ZNF638 on HBV repression involves its binding to cccDNA at specific regions for recruiting HUSH complex to write H3K9me3 histone marks for epigenetic silencing.

To date, both Finio and Termin-8 have not been tested for their potential antiviral activity against megaviruses, such African swine fever virus (ASFV) and its surrogate algal virus, Emiliania huxleyi virus (EhV). Given the limited access and great expense for routine chemical mitigation testing with ASFV, we focused on using EhV as a safe and effective surrogate to evaluate the antiviral activity of these Anitox products. The specific objective of the current study was to evaluate the time course of incubation from hours to days to mimic possible field relevant exposure times for the potential preventative mitigation of megaviruses using Termin-8 and Finio. Methods: Emiliania huxleyi virus was treated with the Anitox recommended concentrations of Termin-8 (0.1% to 0.3% final) and Finio (0.05% to 0.2% final) in biological triplicate experiments. Both viability qPCR (V-qPCR) and standard PCR (S-qPCR) were conducted for EhV copies at 1 hr, 5 hrs, 24 hrs and day 7 post-inoculation. Results: We observed that both Termin-8 and Finio, at their highest treatment concentrations, showed the greatest log reduction of 2 and 4.5 log10 units, respectively, at the earliest 1 hr post-inoculation time point. Although Termin-8 efficacy did not improve with time, treatment with Finio showed 100% viable viral inactivation (>5 log10 reduction units) at the lowest concentration after 7 days of exposure. In addition, Finio showed negligible viral DNA removal post-treatment as observed via S-qPCR, but use of Termin-8 resulted in a reduction of viral DNA (S-qPCR) equivalent to that observed using the V-qPCR assay. Discussion: Our results demonstrate for the first time that both Termin-8 and Finio can be used as effective chemical mitigants against megaviruses such as EhV and ASFV. Moreover, the mechanism of chemical mitigation involves degradation of the virus particle itself. However, although Termin-8 efficacy appeared to be less than that of Finio, this is likely not the case because Termin-8 cross-links protein viral capsids and fixes the viral particle to make it non-infectious. With the threat of ASFV introduction into the North American swine industry and other non-infected regions around the world, the use of both Termin-8 and Finio as an effective preventive or mitigation strategy to prevent the transmission of ASFV by reducing particle viability in contaminated feed. Additional research is warranted with ASFV, in the presence of various types of feed ingredients and complete feeds and use bioassays to evaluate infectivity because results from V-qPCR revealed that intact viable particles remain post-treatment.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

NAFLD is recognized as one of the most prevalent and complex chronic liver diseases globally, with its occurrence and associated mortality rates rising swiftly each year. Due to the high similarity between chicken fatty liver syndrome (FLS) and NAFLD, as well as the easy availability of diseased chickens, the chicken is considered an ideal model for studying the pathogenesis of NAFLD. Previous studies have pinpointed several circular RNAs (circRNAs) implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, yet the underlying functions and mechanisms of numerous circRNAs continue to remain elusive. In this experiment, we utilized circRNA sequencing of chicken livers to identify a novel circRNA, named circACACA, and discovered that it disrupts the metabolic homeostasis of lipids within hepatocytes. Consequently, this disruption leads to oxidative stress and the induction of autophagy, ultimately exerting an adverse effect on chicken liver health. Mechanistically, circACACA functions as a molecular sponge for miR-132b-5p and miR-101-2-5p to modulate the expression of the downstream CBFB/PIM1 complex. Consequently, it influenced the activity of the AKT/mTOR and PPAR-{gamma} signaling pathways to perform its physiological functions. Crucially, we noticed substantial sequence similarity of circACACA across diverse species by comprehensively searching databases. Further, our research with a mouse model confirmed that the functional conservation of circACACA across livers of different species.

These cells expressed FAP markers, responded to muscle injury, and became periosteal cells under normal and muscle injury conditions.

A second fracture activated those cells and stimulated them to become osteoblasts in the inner part of callus. Importantly, ablation of Prg4+ FAPs impaired fracture healing and functional repair. In an intramembranous bone injury model (drill-hole), Prg4+ FAPs became periosteal cells, but their contribution to bone defect repair was significantly less than in fractures. Taken together, we demonstrate the critical role of FAPs in endochondral bone repair and uncover a novel mechanism by which mesenchymal progenitors transform from muscle to cortical bone.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

W.; Paulson, S. G.; Carlile, E. M.; Rotty, J. D.", "abstract": "Cells sense and respond to their environment in a myriad of ways. In many instances they must integrate simultaneous cues ranging from the physical properties and composition of the extracellular matrix to guidance cues that stimulate chemotaxis or haptotaxis. How cells make sense of multiple simultaneous cues is an ongoing physiologically relevant question. The present study seeks to contribute to the understanding of multi-cue sensing by understanding how the transition to a confined setting with or without an added haptotactic gradient alters macrophage migration. We found that the transition to confinement is itself a directional cue capable of driving persistent migration hours after macrophages enter the confined environment. Next, we found that a haptotactic fibronectin gradient made cells even more directionally persistent under confinement. Finally, Arp2/3 complex deletion rendered macrophages unresponsive to the haptotactic gradient, but they retained directionally persistent migration due to their transition to confinement. These findings may be particularly relevant for cells that move from an adherent 2D environment into a confining 3D environment, like leukocytes and circulating tumor cells that extravasate into peripheral tissue.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

The use of ExM has revealed several novel insights into the nanoscale architectures of cellular protein complexes, especially the microtubule cytoskeleton in model and non-model systems. Despite tremendous progress in expansion microscopy protocols that preserve cellular ultrastructure (U-ExM), compatible probes for imaging actin isoforms with U-ExM are still lacking and have hindered the study of diverse actin isoforms and networks across model systems. Here, we use IntAct, an internally tagged actin that incorporates into cellular actin networks, to develop and optimize U-ExM of diverse actin network types in both yeast and mammalian cells. Using expression of ALFA-tagged IntAct variants in yeast and mammalian cells, we show robust visualization of actin patches, cables, and rings in yeast and diverse actin networks such as actin cortex, stress fibers, filopodia, lamellipodium in mammalian cells at improved resolution. We also detect transient nuclear actin filaments using IntAct-U-ExM underscoring the advantages offered by our approach to image understudied actin structures. Overall, we demonstrate the effectiveness of IntAct-U-ExM for performing super-resolution imaging of various actin structures in an isoform-specific manner and highlight the potential of IntAct to study the nanoscale organization of diverse actin cytoskeletal networks across species.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

E.; Chetlapalli, K.; Upadhyayula, S.; King, G. A.; U\u0308nal, E.", "abstract": "In eukaryotic organisms, the nucleus is remodeled to accommodate the space required for chromosome segregation. Remodeling strategies range from closed division, where the nuclear envelope remains intact, to open divisions, where the nuclear envelope is temporarily disassembled. While the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae undergoes closed mitosis, its meiotic nuclear division strategy is less understood. Here we investigate nuclear permeability during meiosis in budding yeast and discover that meiosis II represents a semi-closed division marked by bidirectional mixing between the nucleus and cytoplasm. This includes nuclear entry of the Ran GTPase activating protein (RanGAP), typically cytoplasmic, although RanGAP relocalization appears to be a consequence, rather than a cause of permeability changes. This intercompartmental mixing occurs without nuclear envelope breakdown or dispersal of nucleoporins and is independent of known nuclear pore complex remodeling events. This phenomenon, termed virtual nuclear envelope breakdown (vNEBD), represents a unique mechanism distinct from other semi-closed divisions. We demonstrate that vNEBD is integrated into the meiotic program and regulated by the conserved meiotic kinase Ime2 and the meiosis-specific protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit, Gip1. Remarkably, the vNEBD event is conserved between S. cerevisiae and the distantly related Schizosaccharomyces pombe, indicating a conserved, critical role in meiosis.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

P.", "abstract": "The gastrointestinal tract is home to trillions of microorganisms that interact with their host in profound ways, including regulation of immune, endocrine, and neurological functions. One mechanism by which these microbes interact with their eukaryotic host is through the generation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are metabolized by the intestinal epithelium creating a state of \"physiologic hypoxia\". This hypoxia, in turn, results in stabilization and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), a transcription factor family shown to support gut barrier function and homeostasis, in the intestinal epithelium. The association between HIF and intestinal homeostasis has been long understood, as both genetic and pharmacologic potentiation of the HIF signaling pathway has been shown to promote barrier function both in vitro and in vivo. Although it has been previously established that pathogenic bacteria regulate HIF stabilization and activity in the intestinal epithelium independent of SCFA metabolism, it is not clear whether this property extends to noninfectious and/or commensal bacterial species. Here, we demonstrate that nonpathogenic, commensal strains of Escherichia coli stabilize HIF in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. Further, we show that HIF is transcriptionally active in these cells and drives a \"pro-barrier\" transcriptional program. This property was found to be dependent on bacterial aerobic respiration, as genetic elimination of E. coli aerobic respiration abolished HIF stabilization and the subsequent transcriptional phenotype. Finally, we observed induction of tissue hypoxia in vivo using antibiotic-treated mice colonized with wild-type, but not respiration-deficient, E. coli. These findings demonstrate a novel ability for probiotic E. coli to regulate intestinal homeostasis through activation of HIF and suggest that this mechanism might be leveraged in as a novel therapeutic to combat intestinal inflammation, such as that observed during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

Here, by expressing actin conformation probes based on the CH domain of utrophin, we directly visualize regions of altered F-actin conformation in primary CTLs during migration and killing. By combining these probes with traction force microscopy, we correlate external force with the internal cytoskeleton. We show that actin conformation is regulated upstream of force production, and that force exertion at the cytotoxic immune synapse temporally follows actin conformation dynamics. Our work offers novel insight into the relationship between cellular force production and F-actin conformation in important primary immune cells.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

We developed a method that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to increase acquisition throughput for 3D datasets by creating an AI-derived mask for the targeted region of interest, referred to as Adaptive Scanning. This allowed for specific structures to be imaged at high resolution, with the surrounding area captured at lower resolution, without artificially generating or enhancing any raw data. We demonstrate that this dynamic-resolution scanning approach significantly reduced volume acquisition time across a diverse array of organisms and tissues, including brains, parasites, cultured cells, and plants. This multi-resolution strategy has the potential to enhance Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy and other forms of vEM, by increasing time savings by up to 2-fold or more, enabling routine generation of multiple and/or larger vEM datasets, more efficiently and cost-effectively, allowing more data collection for increase statistical power for comparative studies.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

A.; Kircher, T.; Straube, B.", "abstract": "In healthy individuals active compared to passive movements exhibit earlier neural processing, reflected by more positive contrast estimates of the first-order temporal derivative (TD) of the hemodynamic response function (HRF) in functional MRI (fMRI) analyses. This temporal advantage may play a critical role in self-other distinction. However, whether Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder (SSD) is associated with deficits in sensory-motor predictive mechanisms that influence this earlier processing remains unknown. Patients with SSD (n = 20) and healthy control subjects (HC; n = 20) performed active and passive hand movements, while detected delays in video feedback of their own or another person's hand movement. 3T fMRI data was recorded during the task. To assess response dynamics, we applied the TD to examine timing and the second-order dispersion derivative (DD) to evaluate duration of the HRF. Compared to HC, patients with SSD exhibited delayed BOLD activation during active vs. passive movements in the right caudate nucleus, lobule VIII of right cerebellar hemisphere, left superior temporal gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, left thalamus, and left putamen/insula. For active movement with own hand feedback, HC showed earlier activation in the bilateral putamen and insula, whereas patients with SSD exhibited earlier activation in the left precentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, and postcentral gyrus. Delayed BOLD responses in patients with SSD, particularly in the right cerebellar lobule VIII, bilateral putamen and insula, suggest impaired predictive mechanisms affecting feedback monitoring. These delays may contribute to disturbances in the sense of agency and self-action awareness, potentially underpinning core symptoms of SSD.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

J.; Harper, N. S.", "abstract": "A major goal of neuroscience is to identify whether there are generalized principles that can explain the diverse structures and functions of the brain. The principle of temporal prediction provides one approach, arguing that the sensory brain is optimized to represent stimulus features that efficiently predict the immediate future input. Previous work has demonstrated that feedforward hierarchical temporal prediction models can capture the tuning properties of neurons along the visual pathway, and that recurrent temporal prediction models can explain local functional connectivity within primary visual cortex. However, the visual system is also characterized by extensive inter-areal feedback recurrency, which existing models lack. We aimed to better account for the dynamic features of neurons in the visual cortex by incorporating both local recurrency and inter-areal feedback connectivity into a hierarchical temporal prediction model. The resulting model captured tuning for pattern motion, surround suppression and elements of inter-areal functional connectivity in visual cortex. Moreover, compared with several alternative normative models, the hierarchical recurrent temporal prediction model provided the closest fit to these tuning properties and was best able to explain the emergence of neuronal response properties across the visual cortex. Accordingly, temporal prediction can account for information processing throughout the visual pathway.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

G.; Boto, T.; Ramaswami, M.", "abstract": "Ribonucleo-protein granules (mRNP granules) are thought to contribute to the control of neuronal mRNA translation required for consolidation of long-term memories. Consistent with this, the function of Ataxin-2 in mRNA granule assembly has been shown to be required for long-term olfactory habituation (LTH) in Drosophila, a form of non-associative memory. Knockdown of Ataxin-2 in either local interneurons (LNs) or projection neurons (PNs) of the insect antennal lobe disrupts LTH, leading to a model in which Ataxin-dependent translational control is required in both presynaptic and postsynaptic elements of the LN-PN synapse, whose potentiation has been causally linked to LTH. Here we use novel and established methods for cell-type specific perturbation to ask: (a) whether Ataxin-2 controls mRNA granule assembly in cell types beyond the few that have been examined; and (b) whether it functions not only in LTH, but also for long-term olfactory associative memory (LTM). We show that Ataxin-2 controls mRNP granule assembly in additional neuronal types, namely Kenyon Cells that encode associative memory, as well as more broadly in non-neuronal cells, e.g. in nurse cells in the egg chamber. Furthermore, selective knockdown of Atx2 in alpha/beta and alpha' / beta' KCs blocks appetitive long-term but not short-term associative memories. Taken together these observations support a hypothesis that Ataxin-2 dependent translational control is widely required across different mnemonic circuits for consolidation of respective forms of long-term memories.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

L.; Martin, A.", "abstract": "Organisms mold their tissues into increasingly more complicated shapes during development using a set of deformation motifs. One set of motifs are tissue hinges and creases which are created through cell-level shape changes. Hinges and creases are often made from active, anisotropic cell constriction at the hinge, which can help drive tissue folding. This contractile hinge model is observed in a variety of developmental tissue folding contexts, like during neural tube closure (NTC) of commonly studied species. However, patterns of cells constriction are inconsistent with this model, in the mouse brain. Additionally, formation of the midline neural tube hinge and crease are insensitive to the molecular machinery needed to induce cell shape changes. Here, we test if a contractile hinge is the driving mechanism for mouse cranial NTC. Through targeted laser ablations, we infer tissue tension in the folding mouse cranial neural tube. In contrast to predications of the contractile hinge model, we find the midline hinge has relatively low and isotropic tension, the lateral neural folds have higher anisotropic tension. We also show that regional patterns of tension vary by sex. We propose a lateral tension model for mouse cranial NTC and theorize on the connection between tissue mechanics and sex in NTC defects.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}

However, the potency of individual in vitro SOX2+TBXT+ cells is unclear, confounding comparisons with in vivo data. To address this, we developed a dual Sox2/Tbxt reporter mouse ESC line and demonstrate that single in vitro derived Sox2/Tbxt-expressing cells are bipotent NMPs. In vitro derived NMPs also exhibit lateral plate mesoderm potency when cultured in inductive conditions. Surprisingly, we identified two successively higher Tbxt threshold expression levels that correspond to mesoderm bias and specification, respectively. Moreover, clonally plated Sox2+/Tbxt+ cells self-propagate. Media and substrate composition alter the specification thresholds and consequent differentiation outcomes of in vitro derived mouse NMPs. Using this live reporter line, we uncover rapid inhibition of axis elongation following TBXT downregulation in response to WNT or NOTCH inhibition. In summary, this tractable cell line provides evidence supporting a key role for TBXT in tuning cell fate to drive axis elongation.", "date": "2025-05-15", "journal": ""}
