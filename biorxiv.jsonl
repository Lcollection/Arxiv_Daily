F.; Rufo, G.; Winawer, J.; Simoncelli, E.", "abstract": "The ability of humans to discriminate and identify spatial patterns varies across the visual field, and is generally worse in the periphery than in the fovea. This decline in performance is revealed in many kinds of tasks, from detection to recognition. A parsimonious hypothesis is that the representation of any visual feature is blurred (spatially averaged) by an amount that differs for each feature, but that in all cases increases with eccentricity. Here, we examine models for two such features: local luminance and spectral energy. Each model averages the corresponding feature in pooling windows whose diameters scale linearly with eccentricity. We performed perceptual experiments with synthetic stimuli to determine the largest window scaling for which human and model discrimination abilities match (the \"critical\" scaling). We used much larger stimuli than those of previous studies, subtending 53.6 by 42.2 degrees of visual angle. We found that the critical scaling for the luminance model was approximately one-fourth that of the energy model and, consistent with earlier studies, that the estimated critical scaling value was smaller when discriminating a synthesized stimulus from a natural image than when discriminating two synthesized stimuli. Moreover, we found that initializing the generation of the synthesized images with natural images reduced the critical scaling value when discriminating two synthesized stimuli, but not when discriminating a synthesized from a natural image stimulus. Together, the results show that critical scaling is strongly affected by the image statistic (pooled luminance vs. spectral energy), the comparison type (synthesized vs. synthesized or synthesized vs. natural), and the initialization image for synthesis (white noise vs natural image). We offer a coherent explanation for these results in terms of alignments and misalignments of the models with human perceptual representations.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

This study aims to analyze the spatial flowering pattern of the plant species -Bombax ceiba, Butea monosperma and Cassia fistula across India, through images uploaded on public media repositories like citizen science portals and social media. Citizen science is rapidly emerging as a reliable source of supplementary scientific information, and can be utilized to understand broad patterns of tree behavior. We found that for all three species, flowering period is longer, and begins earlier in southern latitudes as compared to the northern latitudes.

However, the molecular interplay between oncogenic KrasG12D/+(Kras*) and transcription factor CREB in promoting pancreatic cancer progression under chronic inflammation remains poorly understood. METHODS: Experimental alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (ACP) induction was established in multiple mouse models, with euthanasia during the recovery stage to evaluate tumor latency. CREB was selectively deleted (Crebfl/fl) in Ptf1aCreERTM/+;LSL-KrasG12D+/-(KC) genetic mouse (KCC-/-). Pancreata from Ptf1aCreERTM+/-, KC and KCC-/-  mice were analyzed using histological profiling, western blotting, phosphokinase array, and quantitative PCR. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed in ACP-induced KC mice. Lineage tracing analysis using YFP reporter mice and acinar cell explant cultures analysis were also conducted. RESULTS: ACP induction in KC mice significantly impaired the pancreas repair mechanism. Acinar cell-derived ductal lesions demonstrated sustained CREB hyperactivation in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM)/pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions associated with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Persistent CREB activity reprogrammed acinar cells and increased profibrotic inflammation. Notably, acinar-specific Creb deletion in ACP induced models suppressed high-grade PanIN development, restrained tumor progression, and improved acinar cell function. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that CREB cooperates with Kras* to promote irreversible ADM, accelerating pancreatic cancer progression with ACP. Targeting CREB may present a promising strategy to mitigate inflammation-driven pancreatic tumorigenesis.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Recently developed machine learning methods, such as deep learning and gradient boosting, are transforming the real world. These methods could advance QTL mapping methodologies because of their high capability for capturing complex relationships among features. One problem with applying such complex models to QTL mapping is the evaluation of feature importance. In this study, XGBoost, a popular gradient tree boosting algorithm, was applied for QTL mapping in biparental populations with Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs). SHAP is a local (i.e., instance-wise) importance index with the desired properties as feature importance indices. The SHAP-assisted XGBoost (SHAP-XGB) was compared with conventional methods, including composite interval mapping (CIM), multiple interval mapping (MIM), inclusive CIM (ICIM), and BayesC, using simulations and rice heading date data. SHAP-XGB performed comparablely to CIM, MIM, ICIM, and BayesC in mapping main QTL effects and was superior to MIM, ICIM, and BayesC in mapping QTL interaction effects. As SHAP can evaluate local importance, interactions between markers can be visualized by plotting SHAP interaction values for each instance (plant/line). These results illustrated the strength of SHAP-XGB in detecting and interpreting epistatic QTLs and suggest the possibility that SHAP-XGB complements conventional methods.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Active, hardware-mediated solutions are often infeasible or prohibitively costly to build and run across arbitrary collections of input systems. The Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) framework offers a software-based approach to synchronizing data streams based on per-sample time stamps and time synchronization across a common local area netowrk (LAN). Built from the ground up for neurophysiological applications and designed for reliability, LSL offers zero-configuration functionality and accounts for network delays and jitters, making connection recovery, offset correction, and jitter compensation possible. These features can ensure continuous, millisecond-precise data recording, even in the face of interruptions. In this paper, we present an overview of LSL architecture, core features, and performance in common experimental contexts. We also highlight practical considerations and known pitfalls when using LSL, including the need to take into account input device throughput delays that LSL cannot itself measure or correct. The LSL ecosystem has grown to support over 150 data acquisition device classes and to establish interoperability between client software written in several programming languages including C/C++, Python, MATLAB, Java, C#, JavaScript, Rust, and Julia. The resilience and versatility of LSL have made it a major data synchronization platform for multimodal human neurobehavioral recording, now supported by a wide range of software packages including major stimulus presentation tools, real-time analysis envirnoments, and brain-computer interface applications. Beyond basic science, research, and development, LSL has been used as a resilient and transparent back-end in deployment scenarios including interactive art installations, stage performances, and commercial products. In neurobehavioral studies and other neuroscience applications, LSL facilitates the complex task of capturing organismal dynamics and environmental changes occurring within and across multiple data streams on a common timeline.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

First, in the UK Biobank (n=53,026) and Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring (n=3,460) cohorts, plasma GDF15 levels were elevated in individuals with symptoms of depression and anxiety. In the FHS cohort, GDF15 was also higher in participants exposed to chronic psychosocial stressors, including lower educational attainment, lower family income, and higher job strain. Second, plasma GDF15 levels in the FHS cohort correlated positively with epigenetic clocks measuring biological aging and effect sizes of GDF15 associations with psychosocial stressors were comparable to those observed for the clocks. Third, in a two-participant intensive-sampling study (n=112 days), saliva GDF15 showed a robust awakening response similar to established stress-related hormones. However, it exhibited a distinct negative pattern, peaking at waking and declining by 42-92% within 30-45 minutes. Finally, in two laboratory experiments (n=148), acute social-evaluative stress significant increased GDF15 levels in plasma and saliva within minutes.

To identify novel targets for drug development that accommodate the genomic diversity of M. avium-intracellulare, we subjected eight clinical MAC-PD isolates and the type strain ATCC13950 to genome-wide profiling to comprehensively identify universally essential functions. Among these strains, we identified 131 shared essential or growth-defect-associated genes. Unlike the type strain, the clinical strains showed an increased requirement for genes involved in gluconeogenesis and the type VII secretion system under standard growth conditions, the same genes required for hypoxic pellicle-type biofilm formation in ATCC13950. Consistent with the central role of hypoxia in the evolution of M. intracellulare, the clinical MAC-PD strains showed more rapid adaptation to hypoxic growth than the type strain. Importantly, the increased essentiality of hypoxic fitness genes was confirmed in a mouse lung infection model.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which EVs respond to mechanical cues remain poorly understood. Here, we identify caveolin-1 (Cav1), a core structural component of caveolae, specialized membrane invaginations that act as mechanosensors, as a key regulator of EV release and composition under mechanical stress. We demonstrate that both 2D osmotic shock and 3D mechanical compression significantly enhance EV secretion from cancer cells in a Cav1-dependent manner. These EVs exhibit a distinct lipid profile and are selectively enriched in proteins involved in cell adhesion, motility, wound healing and extracellular matrix remodeling, cargo that is lost upon Cav1 deletion. Functionally, EVs secreted from mechanically stressed cells preferentially accumulate in the liver in vivo and promote breast cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro, effects abolished in the absence of Cav1. Together, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for Cav1 in coupling mechanical stress to EV biogenesis and cargo loading, thereby promoting metastatic traits. This study underscores a novel mechanism by which mechanical cues within tumor environment regulate EV-mediated communication and suggests that Cav1-enriched EVs may contribute to pre-metastatic niche formation.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce CoPISA workflow (Proteome Integral Solubility/Stability Alteration Analysis for Combinations), a high-throughput proteomics workflow that delineates drug-protein interactions unique to combinatorial treatments. CoPISA detects protein solubility/stability shifts that emerge only in the presence of two drugs, revealing emergent mechanisms inaccessible to single-agent profiling. Applying CoPISA to two rationally designed AML drug pairs, LY3009120-sapanisertib (LS) and ruxolitinib-ulixertinib (RU), we mapped primary (lysate) and secondary (living cell) target landscapes. Notably, our analysis uncovered a novel mechanistic principle, conjunctional inhibition, wherein cooperative drug actions induce cellular effects not achievable individually, analogous to an AND-gate logic model. LS-specific AND-gate proteins converged on SUMOylation, chromatin condensation, and VEGF-linked adhesion, while RU-specific targets disrupted DNA-damage checkpoints, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and RNA-splicing machinery, collectively implicating synthetic-lethal vulnerabilities. Network interrogation of AML-associated genes showed that a high percentage of perturbed genes are unique to the combinations, including frequently mutated drivers DNMT3A, NPM1, and TP53.

Despite its significance, the mechanisms driving A{beta} deposition in PVS and the resulting vascular pathology remain poorly understood. Growing evidence suggests that fibrinogen, the main component in blood clots, interacts with A{beta} and exacerbates inflammation in AD. Fibrinogen also co-deposits with A{beta} in the PVS of CAA-positive vessels in the brains of hereditary CAA patients. However, the mechanisms by which fibrinogen contributes to cerebrovascular impairment remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we used TgSwDI transgenic mice, which develop robust CAA pathology, and observed a significant increase in fibrin(ogen) extravasation and colocalization with A{beta} in the PVS. Moreover, we observed a significant aquaporin-4 (AQP4) depolarization in CAA-laden blood vessels of TgSwDI mice, which correlated with fibrin(ogen)-A{beta} colocalization. Given AQP4 crucial role in A{beta} clearance through glymphatic pathway, its depolarization may disrupt critical A{beta} clearance, thereby exacerbating CAA pathology. Additionally, Caveolin-1, a protein involved in non-specific transcytosis across the endothelium, significantly increased with age in TgSwDI mice and correlated with fibrin(ogen) extravasation. To further explore the relationship between fibrin(ogen) and these cerebrovascular alterations, we depleted fibrinogen in TgSwDI mice using siRNA approach. This intervention resulted in decreased CAA, restored polarized expression of AQP4, reduced caveolin-1 levels, attenuated microglial activation, and improved spatial memory in fibrinogen-depleted TgSwDI mice.

In the field experiment, ticks survived over 50% longer in areas dominated by the invasive plant compared to those with only native plant species. Invaded areas had lower temperatures and higher relative humidity that likely reduced tick desiccation. The observational study showed greater average tick abundance in native plant communities and no difference in wildlife host (white-tailed deer) activity between plant communities. There was also a positive relationship between tick abundance and white-tailed deer activity, but only in native areas. Together, these results suggest that more favorable microclimate conditions resulting in greater tick longevity are the dominant driver of tick abundance in invaded areas, while tick abundance in native-dominated areas may be promoted, at least in part, by white-tailed deer activity.

This grouping, for which we name the new clade Parapleurota, replaces previous phylogenetic paradigms by rendering the group Parareptilia as a polyphyletic assemblage of stem reptiles, of which millerettids are the most crownward. Our analysis presents hypotheses that resolve long-standing issues in Paleozoic reptile evolution, including the placement of captorhinids on the amniote stem lineage and firm support for varanopids as synapsids, which taken together provide a greatly improved fit to the observed stratigraphic record. Optimizations of character evolution on our phylogenetic hypothesis reveals gradual assembly of crown reptile anatomy, including a Permian origin of tympanic hearing, the presence of a lower temporal fenestra in the amniote common ancestor, with subsequent modifications on the reptile stem lineage, leading to the loss of the lower temporal bar. This evolutionary framework provides a platform for investigating the subsequent radiations of the reptile crown group in the Early Triassic, including the lines leading to dinosaurs (including birds), crocodilians, lepidosaurs, and extinct marine reptiles.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

D.; Lambert, A. V.; White, M. A.", "abstract": "Sex chromosomes often evolve unique patterns of gene expression during spermatogenesis. In many species, sex-linked genes are downregulated during meiosis in response to asynapsis of the heterogametic sex chromosome pair (meiotic sex chromosome inactivation; MSCI). This process has evolved convergently across many taxa with independently derived sex chromosomes. Our understanding how quickly MSCI can evolve and whether it is connected to the degree of sequence degeneration remains limited. Teleost fish are a noteworthy group to investigate MSCI because sex chromosomes have evolved repeatedly across species, often over short evolutionary timescales. Here, we investigate whether MSCI occurs in the threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus), which have an X and Y chromosome that evolved less than 26 million years ago. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found that the X and Y chromosomes do not have a signature of MSCI, maintaining gene expression across meiosis. Using immunofluorescence, we also show the threespine stickleback do not form a condensed sex body around the X and Y, a feature of MSCI in many species. We did not see patterns of gene content evolution documented in other species with MSCI. Y-linked ampliconic gene families were expressed across multiple stages of spermatogenesis, rather than being restricted to post-meiotic stages, like in mammals. Our work shows MSCI does not occur in the threespine stickleback fish and has not shaped the evolution of the Y chromosome. In addition, the absence of MSCI in the threespine stickleback suggests this process may not be a conserved feature of teleost fish, despite overall sequence degeneration and structural evolution of the Y chromosome, and argues for additional investigation in other species. We also observed testis-dependent differences in coding and expression evolution for X-linked genes, revealing evidence of testis specific faster-X effect and gene-by-gene dosage compensation.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

However, it requires access to complex and expensive instrumentation, typically a 300 kV electron cryomicroscope equipped with an energy filter. Simpler and cheaper 200 and 100 kV instruments have been successfully used for single particle cryoEM analyses, which has helped to democratize the technique and broaden access. It has not been systematically studied if 200 kV electron cryomicroscopes can deliver meaningful and interpretable data with respect to electron cryotomography applications. Methods Here, we set out to investigate if a 200 kV electron cryomicroscope without an energy filter can be utilized for in situ structural studies of mammalian cells by electron cryotomography of thin cell edges followed by extensive image analysis including segmentations, subtomogram averaging and molecular sociology studies of lipid droplets. Results We demonstrate that the resulting tomograms of thin edges of U2OS cells are of sufficient quality to annotate the contents of the cell and observe spatial inter-relationships among macromolecules. In particular, we undertook a molecular sociology analysis of lipid droplets and addressed their subcellular distribution and interactions with other organelles. Additionally, we performed subtomogram averaging of purified 70S ribosomes that resulted in ~15 A resolution 3D reconstruction. Finally, we examined geographical distribution and scientific output of the two most common electron cryomicroscopy platforms and deduced that 200 kV instruments are heavily underutilized with respect to electron cryotomography applications.

G.", "abstract": "Variation in the structure and composition of host-associated microbial communities often parallels patterns of phylogenetic divergence between hosts. This pattern is generally known as phylosymbiosis and there is great interest in understanding how such patterns emerge from fundamental ecological and evolutionary processes. Understanding of this phenomenon relies initially on quantifying phylosymbiotic signals from across a broad range of host taxa. Quantifying signals of phylosymbiosis is typically achieved by calculating how congruent a host's phylogenetic tree is with a dendrogram that represents patterns of dissimilarity in their associated microbial communities. To statistically assess the degree of congruence, several studies have constructed null models using a Monte Carlo approach to randomly sample trees. Although this approach is becoming more common, it has several features that warrant benchmarking to advise its further use. This approach relies on quantification of congruence between a host's phylogenetic tree its microbial community dendrogram. Therefore, it is important to establish how choice of congruence metric influence null model-based inferences. Furthermore, phylosymbiotic signals may manifest at different scales of host divergence, and it is important to establish the extent of host phylogenetic breadth needed to reliably detect a phylosymbiotic signal. To help improve our study of phylosymbiosis, here I examine how power and type 1 error (false positive) rates associated with this approach varies with choice of congruence metric and host phylogenetic coverage. I generally found that model performance increased rapidly with increasing tree sizes, suggesting lower limits on the host phylogenetic breadth needed to reliably detect phylosymbiotic signals with this approach. Furthermore, I found minor but notable variations in performance between several congruence metrics, which translated into different inferences regarding signal detection. Overall, these findings suggest this approach is effective and highlight several considerations for its implementation.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

We used contextual word embeddings from a large language model to quantify the linguistic coupling between production and comprehension systems within and across individual brains. We found a highly overlapping network of regions involved in both production and comprehension spanning much of the cortical language network.

Most evidence collated so far has focused in exploring these two phenomena on isolation. Currently, the combined effects of climate change and urbanisation remain underexplored, despite being among the greatest challenges faced by biodiversity. Here, we use a decade-long, individual-based study of urban and forest great tits (Parus major) to analyse urbanisation, climate and their interactive effects on yellow breast colouration, a carotenoid-based trait. We find that urban birds exhibit duller colourations than forest counterparts, being 10-20% less chromatic, with first-year birds and males being more negatively impacted in cities. Additionally, birds in the city are more sexually dichromatic than in the forest. Over the decade, colouration differences between habitats remain stable, following a similar quadratic temporal pattern. Finally, while climate has a weak effect on colouration, urban birds appear more sensitive to its influence than forest birds. Our results indicate urbanisation has a stronger impact than climate on great tit colouration, though both factors may interact. The heightened sensitivity of first-year birds and increased sexual dichromatism in cities may alter the strength of natural and sexual selection on this trait in urban environments.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

A.; Mideo, N.", "abstract": "The timing of investment into reproduction is a key determinant of lifetime reproductive success (fitness). Many organisms exhibit plastic, i.e., environmentally-responsive, investment strategies, raising the questions of what environmental cues trigger responses and why organisms have evolved to respond to those particular cues. For malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.), investment into the production of specialized transmission stages (versus stages that replicate asexually within the host) is synonymous with reproductive investment and also plastic, responding to host- and parasite-derived factors. Previous theory has identified optimal plastic transmission investment strategies for the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium chabaudi, as a function of the time since infection, implicitly assuming that parasites have perfect information about the within-host environment and how it is changing. We extend that theory to ask which cue(s) should parasites use? Put another way, which cue(s) maximize parasite fitness, quantified as host infectiousness during acute infection? Our results show that sensing a parasite-associated cue, e.g., the abundance of infected red blood cells or transmission stages, allows parasites to achieve fitness approaching that of the optimal time-varying strategy, but only when parasites perceive the cue non-linearly, responding more sensitively to changes at low densities. However, no single cue can recreate the best time-varying strategy or allow parasites to adopt terminal investment as the infection ends, a classic expectation for reproductive investment. Sensing two cues--log-transformed infected and uninfected red blood cell abundance--enables parasites to accurately track the progression of the infection, permits terminal investment, and recovers the fitness of the optimal time-varying investment strategy. Importantly, parasites that detect two cues more efficiently exploit hosts, resulting in higher virulence compared with those sensing only one cue. Finally, our results suggest a potential tradeoff between achieving an optimal transmission investment strategy in a given host environment and robustness in the face of environmental or developmental fluctuations.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

One promising approach draws on the concept of critical slowing down (CSD)-a phenomenon in which complex systems lose resilience before tipping points-detected using resilience indicators (RIs) derived from the statistical properties of time series. While disease outbreaks may exhibit such early warning signals of critical transitions, most prior applications of CSD theory to global health have been limited to single diseases or locations, without broad assessments of predictive accuracy or lead time-the interval between the detection of warning signals and the onset of an outbreak. To address these limitations, we integrate CSD theory with time-to-event analyses to evaluate the predictive performance of 17 RIs across 31 infectious diseases in 134 regions worldwide. We find that both RIs and time-to-event analyses provide ample time to implement control measures, reliably anticipating outbreaks with a mean lead time of 17-21 days. Lead time was greater for pathogens with longer incubation periods and in regions with higher Human Development Index. Additionally, temperature and precipitation exhibited unimodal effects on lead time predictions for vector-borne and viral diseases.

Since salt is essential for many physiological processes in insects, rising environmental sodium concentrations may drive behavioral changes, where insects select environments and food sources with suitable sodium levels, or evolutionary changes in constitutive or plastic physiological mechanisms to process salt, potentially altering ecological dynamics and species interactions. Numerous hematophagous (blood feeding) insects such as the yellow-fever mosquito Aedes aeqypti are known to be able to breed in relatively saline environments. Among phytophagous (plant feeding) insects, grasshoppers can be important herbivores in arid and coastal salt-affected regions, whereas the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) appears to perform relatively well on milkweed host plants growing in roadsides influenced by salt runoff. Several of these insects share a common trait: amino acid substitutions in the first extracellular loop of the Na/K-ATPase (NKA), a sodium pump crucial for maintaining ion balance. For the monarch these substitutions confer resistance to toxic cardenolides from milkweeds, but it is unclear whether NKA substitutions may influence salt tolerance. Here, we investigate whether the NKA substitutions found in these insects may contribute to salt tolerance using gene-edited Drosophila melanogaster mutant strains as models. We show that flies with substitution Q111L (found in Aedes mosquitoes) or a combination of Q111L and A119S (found in grasshoppers) exhibited greater salt tolerance, whereas flies carrying the combination of substitutions found in the monarch (Q111V, A119S, and N122H) did not. Our results suggest that the monarch may rely on alternate mechanisms for salt tolerance and that its NKA substitutions are important primarily for cardenolide resistance. However, substitution Q111L and the combination of Q111L and A119S may be relevant for salt tolerance in a variety of insects.

To validate and apply the genetically encoded sensor iGABASnFR2 for wide-field imaging of extracellular GABA, and to characterize how cortical inhibition reorganizes across brain states, sensory modalities, and after GABA transporter blockade. We performed mesoscale imaging in head-fixed C57BL/6 mice systemically expressing iGABASnFR2. Recordings were conducted under isoflurane anesthesia, during quiet wakefulness, natural sleep (NREM and REM), and after administration of the GAT-1 inhibitor Tiagabine. We analyzed both sensory-evoked and spontaneous GABA signals using time-series, spectral, and seed-pixel correlation analyses. iGABASnFR2 demonstrated strong and modality-specific GABAergic responses to sensory stimulation, with faster and stronger activation in the contralateral cortex. Although the general spatial patterns of sensory-evoked GABA responses were consistent across anesthesia and quiet wakefulness, the amplitude, timing, and spread of these responses were significantly greater during wakefulness. During spontaneous activity, cortical GABA levels and connectivity modulated by brain state: GABA amplitude and interhemispheric synchrony were highest during quiet wakefulness but reduced during NREM sleep. Tiagabine elevated baseline GABA levels, abolished stimulus-evoked responses, and enhanced local and long-range inhibitory synchrony. iGABASnFR2 enables reliable, high-resolution imaging of cortical GABA dynamics in vivo. These results demonstrate that inhibitory signaling is dynamically structured across brain states and can be pharmacologically modulated. This tool offers new opportunities to explore the role of inhibition in health and disease at the mesoscale level.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

To develop more effective therapies, we intended to identify the potential therapeutic tumor suppressor microRNAs in OSCC. Previously, a microRNA microarray analysis of 5-Azacytidine treated SCC131 cells had identified 50 upregulated miRs. Of these, miR-631 that had no previously known roles in OSCC was selected for further analysis in the present study. We show that miR-631 binds directly to the oncogene RAB11A and reduces its transcript and protein levels. The upregulation of miR-631 occurs due to its gene promoter demethylation after 5-Azacytidine treatment. We demonstrate that miR-631 reduces proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of OSCC cells in soft agar and promotes apoptosis, in part, via targeting RAB11A. An inverse relationship between miR-631 and RAB11A levels observed across multiple cancer cell lines and in 58.33% of OSCC patient samples highlights the biological significance of their interaction. Further, miR-631 and RAB11A interaction reduces the Wnt signaling in OSCC. Additionally, the nude mice OSCC xenograft study proves the tumor suppressive nature of miR-631. Based on our results, we propose that miR-631 holds promise as a potential therapeutic agent for treating OSCC.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

While long-read sequencing technologies promise to resolve complex genomic regions and improve variant detection, their application in complex genomes has not been well validated. Here, we systematically investigate the factors influencing variant calling accuracy using accurate long reads. Using human trio data with known variants to simulate variable ploidy levels (diploid, tetraploid, hexaploid), we demonstrate that while variant sites can often be identified accurately, genotyping accuracy decreases with increasing ploidy due to allelic dosage uncertainty. This highlights a specific challenge in assigning correct allele counts in polyploids even with high depth, separate from the initial variant discovery. We then assessed genotyping and variant detection performance in real genomes with varying complexity: the relatively simple diploid Fragaria vesca, the tetraploid Solanum tuberosum, and the highly repetitive diploid Zea mays. Our results reveal that overall variant calling accuracy is influenced strongly by inherent genome complexity (e.g., repeat content). Furthermore, we identify a critical mechanism impacting variant discovery: structural variations between the reference and sample genomes, particularly those containing repetitive elements, can induce spurious read mapping. This effect is likely exacerbated by the length and accuracy of long reads. This leads to false variant calls, constituting a distinct and more dominant source of error than allelic-dosage uncertainty. Our findings underscore the multifaceted challenges in long-read variant analysis and highlight the need for ploidy-aware genotypers and bias-aware mapping strategies to fully realize the potential of long reads in diverse organisms.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

In humans, SETD2 is the only known enzyme that catalyzes H3K36me3 in somatic cells and is implicated in tumor suppression across multiple cancer types. While there is considerable crosstalk between the SETD2-H3K36me3 axis and other epigenetic modifications, much remains to be understood. Here, we show that SETD2 functions as a potent tumor suppressor in a KRASG12C-driven lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) mouse model, and that acetylation enhances SETD2 in vitro methylation of H3K36 on nucleosome substrates. In vivo, SETD2 ablation accelerates lethality in an autochthonous KRASG12C-driven LUAD mouse tumor model. Biochemical analyses reveal that polyacetylation of histone tails in a nucleosome context promote H3K36 methylation by SETD2. In addition, monoacetylation exerts position-specific effects to stimulate SETD2 methylation activity. In contrast, mono-ubiquitination at various histone sites, including at H2AK119 and H2BK120, does not affect SETD2 methylation of nucleosomes. Together, these findings provide insight into how SETD2 integrates histone modification signals to regulate H3K36 methylation and highlights the potential role of SETD2-associated epigenetic crosstalk in cancer pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

We find that predictive information decomposition naturally aligns with important social concepts, such as mirroring and dominance. At contest end, we find asymmetries in self-unique and redundant information that reflect the emergent dominance relationship. Applied to mecp2 zebrafish mutants, an autism model, we find that predictive information is reduced overall, but especially for synergistic flows, which is indicative of difficulties in more complex social dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

However, selecting the most effective method for identifying drivers of population change can be challenging, given the wide range of models available for this purpose. In this study, we employed a virtual ecologist approach to compare three methods: time-series (TS), species distribution model (SDM), and process-oriented model (POM), in terms of their ability to correctly identify factors contributing to population changes. While the first two approaches are commonly used in ecological studies in the presented context, the process-oriented method is a novel approach that integrates mechanistic components with correlative approach to identify drivers of population changes. We show that POM outperforms the other methods on all performance measures used, as it has the highest accuracy (0.88), sensitivity (0.84), and specificity (0.93). SDM has the medium (0.68), while TS has the lowest accuracy (0.50). Moreover, our results suggest that variable selection slightly improve the performance of suboptimal models (TS), while it significantly reduces the accuracy of other approaches (SDM and POM).

Despite decades of investigation into the structure and function of heme-based O2 sensors, the molecular mechanisms that enable the tuning of O2 affinity to match specific physiological roles remain unclear. Here, we utilize the O2 sensing mycobacterial DosS protein as a model system to explore the role of tertiary coordination sphere of heme iron in controlling its O2 affinity. By rationally and systematically modifying the tertiary coordination sphere to promote the formation of a Trp-Tyr-Asn H-bond triad within the heme distal pocket, we have enhanced the O2 affinity of WT DosS by over 150-fold. The rationally designed DosS exhibited a Kd value of 3{+/-}1 nM, compared to 460{+/-}80 nM for WT DosS. Employing a combination of structural, biochemical, spectroscopic, and computational studies, our analysis of WT and designed DosS variants highlights how the interplay between distal H-bond networks and heme-pocket electrostatics drives large differences in their O2 sensing capabilities.

While its prognostic significance remains debated, we demonstrate that HDAC6 loss significantly impairs myeloid leukemia progression in vivo, despite having no functional impact on leukemia cell proliferation in vitro. Global proteome and secretome profiling of HDAC6-knockout (KO) cells revealed upregulation of several immune-related modulators, including RNase T2, a tumor suppressor known to modulate the tumor microenvironment. Notably, RNase T2 upregulation upon HDAC6 loss was restricted to myeloid but not B-ALL cells. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of HDAC6 recapitulated this phenotype, leading to RNase T2 upregulation in myeloid leukemia cells. ATAC-seq revealed increased chromatin accessibility of RNase T2 following HDAC6 loss, highlighting a functionally epigenetic regulatory contribution. Further functional assays conducted in an immunocompetent setting both ex vivo and in vivo demonstrated that HDAC6 inhibition sensitized murine myeloid leukemia cells to broad CD8+ T cell activation as evidenced by increased TNF and CD107a expression.\n\nConsistently, in a syngeneic model, HDAC6 inhibition restricted growth myeloid leukemia cells. Moreover, an extended drug screening analysis identified Cytarabine and Clofarabine as significantly synergizing with HDAC6 inhibitor (Ricolinostat) in myeloid leukemia cell lines and in patient derived xenograft (PDX) cells, while showing limited synergy in lymphoid leukemia cell lines, PDX or healthy control cells.

Rigorous reanalysis of our single-cell transcriptomic data, applying stringent quality control measures, validated the quality of TCP cells and their classification as a transcriptionally distinct population. Multiple orthogonal validations of TCP signature genes (SOX11 and HNRNPH1) using RNAscope in situ hybridization, Xenium-based spatial transcriptomics, and immunohistochemistry on additional fetal cerebellar samples across different stages demonstrated the consistent presence of TCPs in the rhombic lip, transitioning from PRTG stem-like zones in the ventricular zone at early developmental stages to the subventricular zone overlapping with EOMES unipolar brush cell precursors at later stages.

A.; Lefebvre, J.", "abstract": "Diversity exists throughout biology, playing an important role in maintaining robustness and stability. The same is true of the brain, as has become increasingly apparent in recent years with the accumulation of datasets of unparalleled resolution. These datasets show widespread neural heterogeneity, spanning cells, circuits and system dynamics, marking it as an unavoidable component of the brain's composition. Recent experiments found declines in heterogeneity amongst neurons may accompany pathological states. While heterogeneity has been linked to stability, robustness and increased computational potential, the loss of biophysical diversity was found conducive to the onset of seizure-like activity, suggesting an important functional role. Despite this, how changes in heterogeneity arise remains unknown. Oftentimes considered a static metaparameter resulting from solely genetic disposition, heterogeneity is, in fact, a highly dynamic property of biological networks arising from various sources. Here, we consider this through the lens of intrinsic plasticity, the activity-dependent modulation of neuron biophysical properties, which we propose allows the degree of biophysical diversity to fluctuate in time. Using a network of Poisson neurons endowed with intrinsic plasticity, we combine analytical and numerical approaches to measure the effect of input statistics on the excitability of individual cells, and how this translates into changes in network heterogeneity at the population scale. Our results indicate that, through intrinsic plasticity, diversity in synaptic inputs promotes heterogeneity in cell-to-cell excitability due to changes in the statistics of presynaptic firing rates, and network topology. In contrast, whenever the statistics of synaptic input between cells were too similar, intrinsic plasticity promoted the decline in heterogeneity. Further, we show that changes in heterogeneity can coexist with degeneracy in the firing rate between neurons. Taken together, understanding how input statistics affect neuronal network heterogeneity may provide key insights into brain function resilience and the manipulability of neural diversity through intrinsic plasticity.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

First, many countries have strict privacy and data protection guidelines for human sequence data, so microbiome data containing partly human data cannot be easily further processed or published. Second, human contamination may cause problems in downstream analysis steps, such as genome assembly and binning. For large-scale metagenomics projects, fast and accurate removal of human contamination is hence critical. Results: We introduce Cleanifier, a fast and memory frugal alignment-free tool for detecting and removing human contamination based on gapped k-mers, or spaced seeds. Cleanifier uses a pangenome index of all human gapped k-mers, but the creation and use of alternative references is also possible. Reads are filtered based on the gapped k-mers present in the index. Cleanifier supports two filtering modes: one that queries all gapped k-mers and one that queries only a sample of them. A comparison of Cleanifier with other state-of-the-art tools shows that our sampling mode makes Cleanifier the fastest method with comparable accuracy. Because we store the gapped k-mers in a probabilistic Cuckoo filter, Cleanifier has similar memory requirements to methods that use a minimizer index. At the same time, Cleanifier is more flexible, because it can use different sampling methods on the same index. Availability and Implementation: The Cleanifier tool is available via gitlab (https://gitlab.com/rahmannlab/cleanifier), PyPi (https://pypi.org/project/cleanifier/) and Bioconda (https://anaconda.org/bioconda/cleanifier).

This study aims to assess the sensitivity of key factors governing the ecology of mosquitoes, using a deterministic, compartmental model developed for the transmission of RVFV in Kenya. Specifically, we investigate the influence of four model parameters on mosquito abundance, focusing on the proportion of water body area utilized for oviposition. A literature review was conducted to establish parameter ranges and distributions. The Sobol method of global sensitivity analysis was then applied to a simplified model environment, firstly with constant temperature and water body area and secondly with periodic temperature and water body area. The indices calculated were used to rank the parameters based on their influence on mosquito abundance. The analysis showed that there is a need to reduce uncertainty in the area scanned by Culex and identified the proportion of water body area used for oviposition as a highly influential parameter.

Despite their known roles in energy supply, calcium homeostasis, and proteostasis, our understanding of how the anabolism-linked organelles are structurally arranged within neurons remains incomplete. Due to the tremendous complexity in the morphologies and fine structural features and interwoven nature of these intracellular organelles, particularly the ER, our understanding of their structural organization is limited, particularly, with regard to quantitative assessments of their sites of interaction and accurate measures of their volumetric proportions inside of a single large neuron. To approach this challenge, we used serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBEM) to generate large-scale 3D EM volumes and electron tomography on high-pressure frozen tissue of the rodent cerebellum, including the largest cells in the vertebrate brain, the cerebellar Purkinje neuron as well as the most abundant cell type in the vertebrate brain, the much smaller cerebellar granule neuron. We reconstructed the neuronal ultrastructure of these different cell types, focusing on the ER, mitochondria and membrane contact sites, to then characterize intracellular motifs and organization principles in detail, providing a first full map to quantitatively describe a neuronal endoarchitectome. At the gross level organization, we found that the intracellular composite of organelles are cell type specific features, with specific differences between Purkinje neurons and Granule cells. At the level of fine structure, we mapped ultrastructural domains within Purkinje neurons where ER and mitochondria associate directly. In addition to cell type specific differences, we observed significant subcellular regional variation, particularly within the axon initial segment (AIS) of Purkinje neurons, where we identified ultrastructural domains with sharply contrasting distributions of ER and mitochondria. These findings suggest a finely tuned spatial organization of organelles that may underpin the distinct functional demands along the axon.

Common techniques for microbial mutation rate estimation fall into 2 camps; rapid, locus specific, generally liquid-culture based fluctuation assays; and slow, genome-wide, generally solid-culture based mutation accumulation experiments. This constrains the hypotheses which can be tested, notably the mutagenic effects of liquid environments cannot be rapidly quantified at a genome-wide scale. One example of such effect is the negative association previously observed between population density and mutation rates at many marker loci using the fluctuation assay. Because homogeneous population density is specifically relevant in liquid culture, this association has not been tested at a truly genome-wide scale. We fill this methodological gap by developing a novel pipeline that relies on population sequencing to capture how mutation rates are affected by population density in liquid cultures. We simulate expected mutation counts in a growing population along with random sampling during sequencing to estimate the necessary sequencing coverage as [&ge;]1,000-fold. We then carry out PCR-free sequencing of 95 wildtype E. coli populations at this coverage, calling rare variants with both reference-based and reference-free methods. These variant-calling methods are prone to different sources of error which can be minimised by considering only mutations called by both pipelines. This approach identifies 119 mutations across all cultures, with (non)coding/(non)synonymous and mutational spectrum profiles consistent with being samples of spontaneous mutation unbiased by selection. The distribution of these mutations also supports the motivating hypothesis, finding that mutation counts across the genome are strongly negatively associated with population density.

However, growing evidence indicates that its physiological activities extend far beyond p53.

The attenuation of CRL4Cdt2 activity by Mdm2 stabilizes its cell cycle-specific substrates including p21, Set8, and Cdt1, at the G2/M phase following their proteasomal degradation in the S phase. Furthermore, the delay in cell cycle progression at the G2/M phase and the decreased cell proliferation observed in the absence of Mdm2 are largely caused by an increase in Cdt2 and a subsequent decrease in p21. Collectively, our data illustrate a previously unexplored mechanism by which Mdm2 regulates the cell cycle and promotes cellular proliferation by neutralising the CR4Cdt2 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and subsequently stabilizing p21.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "IntroductionAngelman Syndrome (AS) is characterized in large part by the loss of functional UBE3A protein in mature neurons. A majority of AS etiologies is linked to deletion of the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene and epigenetic silencing of the paternal copy. A common therapeutic strategy is to unsilence the intact paternal copy thereby restoring UBE3A levels. Identifying novel therapies has been aided by a UBE3A-YFP reporter mouse model. This study presents an analogous fluorescent UBE3A reporter system in human cells.\n\nMethodsPreviously derived induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) with a Class II large deletion at the UBE3A locus are used in this study. mGL and eGFP are integrated downstream of the endogenous UBE3A using CRISPR/Cas9. These reporter iPSCs are differentiated into 2D and 3D neural cultures to monitor long-term neuronal maturation. Green fluorescence dynamics are analyzed by immunostaining and flow cytometry.\n\nResultsThe reporter is successfully integrated into the genome and reports paternal UBE3A expression. Fluorescence expression gradually reduces with UBE3A silencing in neurons as they mature. Expression patterns also reflect expected responses to molecules known to reactivate paternal UBE3A.\n\nDiscussionThis human-cell-based model can be used to screen novel therapeutic candidates, facilitate tracking of UBE3A expression in time and space, and study human-specific responses. However, its ability to restore UBE3A function cannot be studied using this model. Further research in human cells is needed to engineer systems with functional UBE3A to fully capture the therapeutic capabilities of novel candidates.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Such adaptability is governed by complex gene-diet interactions, yet the molecular circuits integrating microbe-derived metabolites with host metabolic and stress response pathways remain less explored. Here, we identify the conserved mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) component, RICTOR, as a critical regulator of dietary plasticity in Caenorhabditis elegans, specifically in response to bacterially derived vitamin B12 (B12). Loss of rict-1, the C. elegans ortholog of RICTOR, confers enhanced osmotic stress tolerance and longevity on B12-rich bacterial diets. These phenotypic adaptations require two B12-dependent enzymes: methionine synthase (METR-1), functioning in the folate-methionine cycle (Met-C), and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMCM-1), a mitochondrial enzyme essential for propionate catabolism. The latter catalyzes the formation of succinyl-CoA, subsequently converted to succinate via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Elevated succinate levels were found to induce mitochondrial fragmentation, thereby activating mitophagy, an autophagic process indispensable for the increased stress resilience and longevity observed in the rict-1 mutants. Crucially, this Met-C-mitophagy axis is modulated by microbial inputs, with B12 and methionine acting as proximal dietary signals. Our findings delineate a mechanistic framework through which RICTOR restrains host sensitivity to microbial-derived metabolites, thus maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and regulating lifespan. This work reveals a pivotal role for RICTOR in insulating host physiology from environmental nutrient-driven perturbations by modulating organellar quality control pathways.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

The effector SteE, which polarises macrophages into an anti-inflammatory state, is critical during invasive disease. SteE operates via an unprecedented mechanism, reprogramming the host serine/threonine kinase GSK3 to perform tyrosyl-directed phosphorylation of neosubstrates, including the immune transcription factors STAT1 and STAT3. Here, we demonstrate that SteE-driven transcriptional reprogramming relies critically and specifically on STAT3 phosphorylation and DNA binding. By activating STAT3 via a non-canonical pathway, bypassing endogenous negative feedback mechanisms, SteE drives hyperactivation of STAT3 target genes, surpassing the effects of canonical IL10 signalling. Hyperactivation correlates with elevated phosphorylated STAT3 in the macrophage nucleus, facilitating opening of chromatin regions not accessible during endogenous cytokine signalling. Overall, our study illustrates how hijacking of a signalling pathway by SteE dramatically reshapes the macrophage gene regulatory network to enhance Salmonella immune evasion.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we establish a fluid shear stress-dependent mechanism of Notch1 activation that is distinct from canonical ligand trans-endocytosis. Application of laminar flow triggers the rapid spatial polarization of full-length Notch1 heterodimers into downstream membrane microdomains. Unlike canonical transactivation, this response occurs independently of ligand redistribution, and Notch1 receptors are cis-endocytosed into the receptor-bearing cell within polarized microdomains prior to proteolytic activation. We discover that the Notch1 intracellular domain (ICD) critically orchestrates receptor polarization and proteolytic activation in response to flow but is dispensable for canonical ligand transactivation. Shear stress increases ICD interaction with annexin A2 and caveolar proteins which control Notch1 endocytosis and proteolytic membrane compartmentalization. These findings define a flow-specific Notch1 mechanotransduction pathway linking receptor polarization and endocytosis with proteolytic activation and establish new mechanisms regulating Notch receptor activation.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

The choroid is thought to play a crucial role in relaying signals from the retina to the sclera to modulate eye growth, but which cells are targeted and how they interact is not known. Using primary cultures of pediatric and adult human choroid and sclera stromal fibroblasts, we investigated the effect of choroid-conditioned medium (CCM) on scleral fibroblasts contractile activity. We show that CCM activates pediatric scleral fibroblast contraction, with age and antero-posterior location differences. Upon exposure to dopamine, a known negative regulator of eye growth, pediatric - but not adult - choroid cells lose their ability to stimulate scleral fibroblasts. Using RNA-Sequencing, we show that dopamine stimulates pathways linked to ribosomal activation, translation and exosome release exclusively in pediatric choroid cells. Removing exosomes from the CCM rescued the ability of dopamine-treated choroid cells to stimulate scleral fibroblasts. We further identify retinoic acid as the active exosome-associated compound preventing scleral fibroblast activation. Mechanistically, we show that CCM stimulates actomyosin-mediated protrusive activity in scleral fibroblasts. This is prevented when scleral cells are exposed to dopamine-CCM, and fully rescued upon exosome removal or ALDH1 inhibition. We thus propose that pediatric choroid stromal cells specifically relay dopamine-mediated retinal signals to the sclera during post-natal eye growth, operating through changes in secretome - including the production of exosome-associated retinoic acid - rather than gene expression changes.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

In parallel, we made diphtheria toxin-mediated cell type ablation compatible with human cells, thereby enabling in-depth interrogation of the sequence of events during depletion and reappearance of stem cells. Following LGR5+ stem cell depletion, most of the remaining epithelial cells entered a regenerative state characterized by fetal-like expression programs. Strikingly, this regenerative response was already initiated before stem cell loss, indicative of active communication between functional stem cells and progeny during homeostasis. We identified inactivation of retinoid X receptor (RXR) as a crucial trigger to initiate the regenerative response in colonocytes, with human colon stem cells being the producer of the RXR stimulus retinoic acid. Thus, stem cell-derived retinoic acid actively suppresses the regenerative state in colonocytes, explaining how surviving cells sense stem cell loss.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Individual clones isolated from a common population exhibit consistent spatial propensities for anterior or posterior fates. While pure clones generate elongated structures less frequently than a polyclonal population, mixing clones restores proper axial elongation. Spatial transcriptomics reveals that pure clones show disrupted gene expression with inappropriate coexpression of anterior and posterior markers, while clone combinations restore proper spatial organization.

To maintain genome integrity, cells activate DNA repair pathways that prevent harmful outcomes such as cancer or immune dysfunction. In this study, we uncover a novel role for DNA damage during the terminal differentiation of multiciliated cells (MCCs). MCCs, which line the airways, reproductive tracts, and brain ventricles, produce hundreds of motile cilia, each anchored by a centriole. Therefore, MCCs must generate hundreds of centrioles during differentiation. Normally, centriole duplication is tightly linked to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, raising questions about how MCCs override numerical and temporal restrictions on centriole duplication. We find that differentiating MCCs accumulate extensive double-stranded DNA breaks during centriole amplification, with damage levels correlating with centriole number. DNA damage response (DDR) kinases are essential for supporting centriole biogenesis and ciliogenesis. We also observe that transcriptional activity, required for the expression of centriole and cilia genes, produces RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) that co-localize with DNA damage. This suggests that transcription-coupled DNA damage helps initiate a pseudo cell cycle program, permitting centriole amplification without triggering full S/G2 phase processes. Our findings indicate that MCCs harness DDR signaling as part of their developmental program, revealing a broader principle in which the canonical cell cycle is adaptively rewired during differentiation.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

By optimizing substrate concentrations, we increased assay sensitivity >10-fold in tomato leaf tissue. We further adapted this protocol for Nicotiana benthamiana, a model plant widely used for transient recombinant protein expression. Expression of epitope-tagged ADCs in this system revealed a direct correlation between protein abundance and enzymatic activity, demonstrating that ADC activity can infer its protein abundance in native tissues. Proof-of-principle experiments with the N. benthamiana expression system, confirm substrate specificity of tomato ADC and ODC enzymes and essential catalytic residues of tomato ADCs. Beyond enzymatic activities, our LCMS-based method also permits quantification of 11 PA network metabolite concentrations from the same LCMS sample. Visualizing this data as a heatmap pathway diagram, alongside ADC/ODC activities provides a comprehensive overview of PA metabolism in plant tissues. We also studied tomato CRISPR-Cas9-induced mutants deficient in ADC or ODC, complemented by phenotypic analysis. LC-MS analysis of an adc1/adc2 double mutant - an embryo lethal genotype in Arabidopsis - had no detectable agmatine, the product of ADCs.

The glycoside hydrolase SiGH11 cleaves the xylan backbone and releases O-acetylated oligosaccharides, which are subsequently deacetylated by the XynE-like esterase SiAXE. These enzymes are co-expressed within a monocot-specific transcriptional program that is enriched in carbohydrate-active enzymes and sugar transporters. Their combined activity enhances enzymatic degradation and facilitates downstream hydrolysis by exo-xylanases, which reduces the production of apoplastic reactive oxygen species triggered by damage-associated molecular patterns.

Spectral notches can be added to the stimulus spectrum due to filtering by the outer ear, and can be used as monaural cues related to head or pinna position for localizing sound sources. In addition, broadband sounds with spectral notch are known to produce auditory enhancement, a perceptual phenomenon in which a target within a spectrally notched masker can become salient if preceded by a copy of the masker. Notched noise can also produce an auditory illusion, called Zwicker Tone (ZT), which is perceived immediately after stimulation and whose pitch corresponds to the spectral notch. The present study aimed to further investigate the mechanisms of auditory enhancement, including those of ZT, in the inferior colliculus of awake mice. We show that neural activity can be strongly suppressed during NN stimulation and enhanced immediately after NN stimulation. These effects depend on notch center frequency relative to the best frequency of neurons, stimulus level and notch width. Our results are consistent with the mechanisms described for post-inhibitory rebound in the central auditory system: NN could hyperpolarize the membrane potential, which can then activate several cationic conductances, leading to a rebound of neural activity.

Although various brain structures exhibit masculine or feminine characteristics, no strictly binary anatomical feature, such as those seen in genitalia, has been identified. In this study, we identified a dense, sexually dimorphic cluster of neurons in the posterodorsal medial amygdala (MeApd), which we named DIMPLE, that exhibited a remarkable binary pattern of cFos activation. Using the TRAP2 (Targeted Recombination in Active Populations) transgenic mouse model, we found that it was consistently labeled in all females, regardless of age or sexual experience. In males, however, DIMPLE was not labeled in any of the adult virgins but was evident pre-weaning and following mating. Surgical removal of gonads (ovariectomy or orchiectomy) did not alter the labeling pattern of DIMPLE in either sex. Interestingly, a single intraperitoneal injection of prolactin, a hormone known to increase in males after mating, induced DIMPLE labeling in virgin males. However, treatment with cabergoline, a potent inhibitor of prolactin secretion, did not prevent DIMPLE labeling in females or in post-mating males. Given the established role of the MeApd in social and reproductive behaviors, we propose that DIMPLE may support neural mechanisms underlying female-typical behavior and potentially contribute to post-mating behavioral shifts in males.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

E.; Sze, S. K.", "abstract": "Brain aging is characterized by progressive breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which correlates with neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. Emerging evidence implicates degenerative modifications of the vascular proteins as a key driver of BBB dysfunction. In particular, spontaneous deamidation of Asp-Gly-Arg (NGR) motifs generates isoAsp-Gly-Arg (isoDGR) sequences that structurally mimic canonical Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin-binding ligands. Here, we show that age-associated accumulation of isoDGR in the brain cortex induces endothelial cytoskeletal collapse and tight junction disorganization, leading to BBB breakdown. Using mice lacking the L-isoaspartyl repair enzyme PCMT1 (which accelerates isoDGR accumulation) and wild type aged mice, we found markedly elevated isoDGR in brain tissues accompanied by focal microhemorrhages and increased BBB permeability. Recent whole-genome sequencing suggests that a common PCMT1 variant is linked to neurodegenerative disease risk, indicating potential clinical relevance in vascular aging. Remarkably, systemic treatment with an isoDGR-neutralizing antibody largely prevented capillary breaches and leakage, and even restored barrier integrity in aged wild-type mice. To uncover the molecular mechanism, we exposed brain endothelial cells to synthetic isoDGR-peptides, which recapitulated these effects. Unbiased RNA-sequencing reinforced these findings, revealing broad transcriptomic reprogramming of cytoskeletal, cell-cell junction, inflammatory, and stress-response pathways. Functional studies demonstrated that isoDGR triggered collapse of F-actin stress fibers, disrupted junctional ZO-1 and VE-cadherin, increased monolayer permeability to macromolecules, and impaired endothelial cell migration and proliferation. IsoDGR-treated endothelial cells exhibited increased oxidative stress, upregulation of ICAM-1/VCAM-1/CCL-2, and adopted a senescent phenotype. Our results suggest that isoDGR hijacks endothelial integrin signaling to destabilize the actin cytoskeleton and tight junctions, a process that breaches the BBB and subsequently activates inflammatory and senescence programs. In summary, we identify BBB disruption via isoDGR-induced cytoskeletal dysfunction as a central pathology of vascular aging, and demonstrate that targeting isoDGR damage preserves BBB integrity and attenuates neuroinflammation.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

We expressed in mice of both sexes an AppNL-G-F allele, harboring familial AD mutations, specifically in cholinergic medial septum (MS) neurons, and compared the phenotype to mice with global AppNL-G-F expression. Over the course of 14 months, as mice reached late middle age, targeted expression led to the loss of about one-third of MS cholinergic neurons and widespread amyloid deposition in their terminal fields, especially in the hippocampus and, to a lesser extent, on blood vessels. This selective vulnerability of ageing cholinergic cells to amyloid, markedly reduced REM sleep and caused cognitive and emotional alterations resembling those in mice with the mutation expressed throughout the brain. Mice with global AppNL-G-F expression also had a previously unreported selective death of about 20% of their medial septal cholinergic cells. Although the broadcasting of amyloid by medial septal cholinergic cells is a notable feature, and potentially important in human pathology, selective genetic lesioning of about one third of the medial septal cholinergic cells, independently of amyloid, gave the same REM sleep, cognitive and emotional phenotypes. Thus, it is the killing of the cholinergic cells by amyloid, and therefore the missing acetylcholine, and not the secreted/deposited amyloid in the hippocampus and other areas that is the critical feature. These findings underscore the interest in revitalizing the classic cholinergic hypothesis of AD. Restricting pathological amyloid expression to MS cholinergic neurons, so that their health is compromised by amyloid, is sufficient to reproduce many AD-like symptoms, highlighting the critical role of these cells in early AD pathogenesis, REM sleep regulation, emotion and cognition.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Starting from a laminar neural mass framework, where each mass comprises distinct slow (alpha-band) and fast (gamma-band) oscillatory pyramidal subpopulations (P1 and P2), we show how laminar-specific long-range excitatory projections across neural mass parcels can give rise to both cooperation and competition via cross-frequency envelope coupling. We demonstrate that homologous connections across parcels (e.g., P1[-&gt;]P1 or P2[-&gt;]P2) induce positive correlations between the infra-slow amplitude fluctuations of alpha band envelopes in each parcel, as well as in the simulated fMRI BOLD signals. Conversely, heterologous connections (P1[-&gt;]P2) induce negative correlations. We tested this mechanism by building personalized whole-brain models for a cohort of 60 subjects in two steps. First, we inferred signed inter-parcel generative effective connectivity directly from resting-state fMRI using regularized maximum-entropy (Ising) models. Then we connected laminar neural masses to simulate BOLD dynamics by implementing positive and negative Ising connections via homologous and heterologous projections, respectively. Ising-derived cooperative/competitive connectivity modeling faithfully reproduced both static and dynamic functional connectivity patterns, as well as gamma power-BOLD correlation and partial alpha power-BOLD anticorrelation-outperforming structurally constrained and cooperative-only variants. This further demonstrates that functional data alone suffices to infer individualized connectivity. Together, these results provide a biologically grounded mechanistic model on how long-range excitatory circuits and local cross-frequency interactions shape the balance of cooperation and competition in large-scale brain dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

A fundamental assumption in the field is that the functional specialization of a brain region arises from its connections to the rest of the brain, but limitations in the amount of data that can be feasibly collected in a single individual, leaves open the question: Is the association between task activation and connectivity consistent across the brain and many cognitive tasks? To answer this question, we fit ridge regressions models to activation maps from 33 cognitive domains (generated with NeuroQuery) using resting-state functional connectivity data from the Human Connectome Project as the predictor. We examine how well functional connectivity fits activation and find that all regions and all cognitive domains have a very robust relationship between brain activity and connectivity. The tightest relationship exists for higher-order, domain-general cognitive functions.

Despite these limitations, phytoplasmas, which are parasitic, insect-transmitted plant pathogens maintain a diverse arsenal of secreted effectors that manipulate both plant and insect hosts to promote infection and transmission. These effectors can suppress immunity and reprogram plant development, including witch's broom and leaf-like flowers, through ubiquitin-independent degradation of key transcription factors. However, how phytoplasmas diversify and maintain these effectors in the absence of frequent genetic exchange remains unclear. To address this, we analysed the effectoromes of 239 phytoplasma genomes and identified a diverse set of secreted proteins, which we designated as Phytoplasma-Associated Molecular Effectors (PhAMEs). We found that PhAMEs targeting evolutionarily conserved and structurally constrained surfaces of host proteins are widespread across phytoplasmas. These effectors adopt compact, efficient folds. They often function as molecular scaffolds with dual interaction surfaces capable of linking host proteins or integrating signalling pathways. Such scaffolding PhAMEs have evolved multiple times independently, providing clear evidence of convergent evolution. Despite severe genomic constrains imposed by genome reduction and limited HGT, gene duplications, interface variations, domain fusions, and repeat expansions have helped the shaping effector fold and diversity. While the overall effector repertoire of phytoplasmas appeared largely unique, some PhAME domains share similarities with proteins from other mollicutes and pathogens. Collectively, our findings shed light on how genome-reduced bacteria innovate molecular functions and offer insights into phytoplasma biology, effector evolution, and host-pathogen dynamics.

J.; Cetkovic, H.; Jeffery, W. R.", "abstract": "The loss of pigmentation is a hallmark adaptation of cave-dwelling animals but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study investigates the cellular and biochemical basis of albinism, the loss of melanin pigment, which convergently evolved across a wide range of cave animals. Is albinism caused by the interruption of pigment synthesis or elimination of the pigment cell lineage? The results suggest that albinism evolved by a common mechanism, a block in the first step of the melanin biosynthesis pathway, the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA, in diverse albino cave animals ranging from annelids and mollusks to vertebrates. Pigment cells are conserved in all tested albino cave species and distributed in patterns resembling pigmentation in their close surface relatives. The cells capable of melanin synthesis when provided with L-DOPA substrate were detected at the sites of injuries in a cave annelid, cave mollusk, and cave teleost, suggesting roles in innate immunity during tissue repair, which may explain why pigment cells are conserved despite the loss of pigment production. Next, we focused on the longstanding issue of the evolutionary forces involved in the regression of pigmentation in cave animals and explored hypotheses of why losing pigmentation might be adaptive in cave environments. First, we tested the hypothesis that pigment regression may conserve energy, which is important for survival in the food-limited cave environment. Our results indicate that melanin synthesis has a marked energetic cost in the cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus. Lastly, we show that the disruption of melanin synthesis at its first biosynthetic step is correlated with increased dopamine levels in multiple depigmented cavefish populations, including populations that evolved albinism independently. This result supports a widespread tradeoff between the melanin and catecholamine synthesis pathways in A. mexicanus. We conclude that the interruption of the conversion of L-tyrosine to L-DOPA in the synthesis of melanin confers multiple advantages that could serve as targets of natural selection, supporting an adaptive hypothesis for the evolution of albinism in cave animals.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Here, we address this gap by performing a comprehensive cross-study analysis of 2,356 sequencing samples from 17 published studies and an in-house generated dataset, applying a uniform bioinformatics pipeline to enable a controlled comparison of experimental workflows. Our analysis reveals that the vast majority of transcriptomic variation is explained not by biology, but by inter-laboratory batch effects. The main determinants of these effects are technical, principally genomic DNA contamination levels and library diversity.

As genomic datasets grow in scale, the efficiency of these data structures increasingly depends on how well they leverage the inherent patterns in the data. One recent and effective approach is the use of learned indexes that approximate the rank function of a multiset using a piecewise linear function with very few segments. However, theoretical worst-case analysis struggles to predict the practical performance of these indexes. We address this limitation by developing a novel measure of piecewise-linear approximability of the data, called CaPLa (Canonical Piecewise Linear approximability). CaPLa builds on the empirical observation that a power-law model often serves as a reasonable proxy for piecewise linear-approximability, while explicitly accounting for deviations from a true power-law fit. We prove basic properties of CaPLa and present an efficient algorithm to compute it. We then demonstrate that CaPLa can accurately predict space bounds for data structures on real data. Empirically, we analyze over 500 genomes through the lens of CaPLa, revealing that it varies widely across the tree of life and even within individual genomes.

Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of the plant microbiome in enhancing plant resilience to heat stress. However, our understanding of the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying root-microbiome interactions under heat stress remains limited. To elucidate the role of native soil microbes in the heat tolerance of soybean genotypes, we analyzed rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities via 16S rRNA and ITS sequencing, and characterized root metabolites and anatomical traits in response to microbiome composition and heat stress. Soybean plants were grown under controlled conditions in either natural soil containing native microbiota or in microbiome-disturbed soil (via 3-hour autoclaving), under both optimal and elevated temperature regimes. Alpha and beta diversity analyses revealed significant microbial shifts between treatments. Distinct clustering of bacterial, fungal, and metabolite profiles was observed under high temperature and microbial disturbance. Nodule-forming bacteria such as Rhizobium and Janthinobacterium were markedly suppressed, and belowground traits exhibited sensitivity, with significantly reduced nodule numbers and nodulation efficiency under high temperature and soil microbial perturbation. Non-targeted root metabolomics identified 372 differentially accumulated metabolites. Integrative multi-omics analysis revealed associations between metagenomic profiles, metabolite levels, and nitrogen-fixation traits, implying a coordinated modulation of root physiological processes.

Harpins are secreted by many gram-negative phytopathogens via the type III secretion system and are known for their ability to trigger hypersensitive response followed by induction of systemic acquired resistance in non-host plants. However, there is lack of studies on exploring the mechanism of action of harpins. In this study, we report cloning of a novel harpin gene (HrpZ2) from Pseudomonas syringae strain MTCC-11950, belonging to harpin superfamily. In silico analysis revealed that about 50.29% of the protein consists of alpha-helices, 48.53% are random coils, and only 1.16% are beta-sheets, and nearly half (42%) of the protein consists of intrinsically disordered regions. Based on a prokaryotic predictive model and the presence of a signal peptide on its N-terminus, the subcellular localization of harpin is predicted as extracellular. Determination of protein sequence and structure are fundamental to understanding its biological function. To date, no experimentally determined crystal structure of any harpin protein is available. Using this information, we built and validated an ab initio model (with 99% of residues in allowed/additionally allowed regions and a Z-score of -5.3) of harpin. Phylogenetic analysis and functional domain studies revealed that this novel harpin belongs to the harpin superfamily. Infiltration of harpin in tobacco leaves resulted in hypersensitive response, which was associated with oxidative burst, callose deposition, localized cell death, and increased activity of defense-related enzymes such as phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and polyphenol oxidase. Furthermore, infiltration of harpin in non-host plants from different angiosperm families induced hypersensitive response, indicating broad-spectrum agricultural applicability of this novel harpin protein.

The pid mutants fail to initiate flowers on inflorescences, a phenotype that is mimicked by disrupting either the NAKED PINS IN YUC MUTANTS (NPY) gene family or PIN FORMED 1 (PIN1). Both PID and NPY1 have been reported to positively modulate PIN-mediated polar auxin transport. Here, we show that overexpression of NPY1 (NPY1 OE) completely suppressed pid null mutants, demonstrating that NPY1 functions downstream of PID. NPY1 OE triggered phosphorylation of PIN proteins at multiple sites that are mostly different from the previously characterized phosphorylation sites regardless of the presence of PID. Phosphorylation of the newly identified PIN sites in NPY1 OE plants likely leads to the inhibition of PIN functions, as we previously showed that pid is suppressed by decreasing PIN1 gene dosage or decreasing PIN1 activity. Furthermore, we show that the Ser/Thr rich C-terminal motif in NPY1 is phosphorylated and is required for pid suppression by NPY1 OE. Overexpression of NPY1 that lacked the C-terminal motif (NPY1{Delta}C) failed to rescue pid, but overexpression of NPY1{Delta}C was still able to trigger phosphorylation of PIN proteins including PIN2, which is known to cause agravitropic roots when mutated. NPY1{Delta}C overexpression plants displayed a complete loss of root gravitropic response, likely caused by PIN2 phosphorylation. Our results suggest a pathway for auxin mediated-flower initiation, in which PID regulates NPY1 accumulation and/or activity, and subsequently, NPY1 triggers phosphorylation of PIN proteins and inhibition of PIN functions.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

We developed a comprehensive quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) model of mitochondrial metabolism to interrogate specific pathways hypothesized to contribute to reductions in reserve cardiac power output in heart failure. The aim of this work was to understand how changes in mitochondrial function and cardiac energetics associated with heart failure may affect exercise capacity. To accomplish this task, we coupled published in silico models of oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid cycle with a model of {beta}-oxidation and extended the model to incorporate an updated representation of the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) to account for the role of PDH in substrate selection. We tested several hypotheses to determine how metabolic dysfunction, such as a decrease in PDH activity or altered mitochondrial volume, could lead to marked changes in energetic biomarkers, such as myocardial phosphocreatine-ATP ratio (PCr/ATP). The model predicts expected changes in fuel selection and also demonstrates PDH activity is responsible for substrate-dependent switch driven by feedback from NAD, NADH, ATP, ADP, CoASH, Acetyl-CoA and pyruvate in healthy and simulated HF conditions.

Mechanoreceptor properties, their change in the context of ageing and the somatotopically organized supraspinal connections between sensory and motor systems provide a neuroanatomical basis for the prediction that cortical structures are involved in the control of passive movements. Previous electromyographic evidence indeed show movement speed and -type-dependent changes in muscle activity. This study aimed to provide electrophysiological evidence for the involvement of frontal cortex inhibition and corticomotor interactions in the control of passive movements. Methods: Continuous and discontinuous passive elbow movements were performed in healthy younger (n = 20, 22.5 +/- 2.31 y) and older (n = 20, 72.7 +/- 5.73 y) adults at three movement speeds (20, 60, and 100 bpm) while electro-encephalographic (EEG) and electromyographic (EMG) data were acquired. Alpha power and beta corticomuscular connectivity were used as measures of frontal cortex inhibition and brain-muscle connectivity, respectively. Results: Frontal cortex inhibition decreased (p = 0.036) and brain-muscle connectivity increased (p < 0.001) with increasing movement speeds. In addition, frontal cortex inhibition was 17% higher in the discontinuous condition as compared to the continuous condition (p = 0.005) while corticomuscular coherence was 25.9% higher in the continuous vs. the discontinuous condition (p < 0.001). These effects were independent of age. Conclusion: The present results provide insights into the control of passive movements and show that frontal cortex inhibition and brain-muscle interactions depend on movement speed and movement type.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Nanopore sequencing has the potential to serve as a rapid diagnostic method for sepsis. However, extracting bacterial DNA from blood samples is challenging due to the high content of host DNA. This study aimed to develop and optimize a method using saponin and SAN nucleases for effective host DNA depletion in blood cultures. Different concentrations of saponin, HL-SAN, and M-SAN nucleases, combined with various salt conditions (NaCl and MgCl2), were tested for their ability to deplete host DNA in blood cultures spiked with E. coli and S. aureus. The impact of different bead beating durations on DNA fragment sizes was also examined. The efficiency of host DNA depletion and bacterial DNA extraction was assessed using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and nanopore sequencing. Results indicated that 4% of saponin effectively lysed host cells, releasing DNA while preserving bacterial cells. The host DNA is then efficiently depleted using 250 units (10 L) of HL-SAN and M-SAN nucleases. Although SAN in combination with higher salt concentrations (2.5 M NaCl and 50 mM MgCl2) showed somewhat better host DNA removal, the difference was not statistically significant. Reducing bead beating time to 6 minutes improved the recovery of longer DNA fragments compared to 10 minutes.

W.; Goloborodko, A.", "abstract": "DNA replication creates two sister chromatids that must acquire specific three-dimensional conformations to support genome function and stability. This organization is largely mediated by cohesin complexes, which extrude intra-chromosomal loops and link two chromatids, thus forming \"chromatid cohesion\". Although sister chromatids are genetically identical, the replication process is intrinsically asymmetric: each chromatid inherits a different parental DNA strand, while the new strands are synthesized using distinct \"leading\" and \"lagging\" mechanisms of the replication fork. Whether and how this molecular asymmetry impacts higher-order chromatin organization remains unknown. Using sister-chromatid-sensitive Hi-C, strand-specific FISH, and polymer modeling, we reveal a consistent, genome-wide shift in sister chromatid alignment, biased along the 5->3 direction of the inherited strands. This shift persists without loop extrusion but is lost upon disruption of cohesion, implicating cohesive cohesins in maintaining the displacement. Polymer simulations indicate that a modest (~100 kb) misalignment of \"cohesive\" cohesins is responsible for the observed asymmetry. We propose two mechanistic models that explain how this displacement arises from replication fork asymmetry: either through the dislocation of cohesin during replication or through the asymmetric anchoring and subsequent random sliding of cohesin pairs. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized chromosome-scale asymmetry in sister chromatid organization, which has implications for homology search during DNA repair.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

To model the interactions between the amnion and epiblast, we differentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to amnion-like cells (AMLCs) and juxtaposed them in a controlled manner with undifferentiated hPSCs, which represent the epiblast. We found that juxtaposition between these cell types is sufficient to initiate a range of cell behaviors associated with gastrulation including organized differentiation to primitive streak and downstream mesendodermal cell fates and directed cell migration out of the primitive streak region. Performing knockout experiments specifically in either the epiblast or amnion compartment revealed intricate crosstalk that is required to properly initiate gastrulation. In particularly, using knockouts of NODAL we show that Nodal signaling in both the amnion and epiblast is required for gastrulation patterning.

Prioritizing causal variants within these loci is critical for characterizing trait biology. Statistical fine mapping identifies causal variants at trait-associated loci, but linkage disequilibrium (LD) and limited GWAS sample sizes prevent the resolution of many associations. Functionally informed approaches augment fine mapping by estimating variant prior causal probabilities based on overlap with trait-relevant functional annotations. However, functional enrichment provides only an indirect proxy for variant functional impact. Sequence-to-function models directly estimate variant effects on molecular phenotypes from underlying sequence context. Borzoi is a long-context model that predicts sequence determinants of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation across diverse tissues and cell types. Here we present Sniff, a Borzoi-informed fine-mapping approach that integrates broad genomic functional annotations with Borzoi-predicted variant effects via PolyFun to estimate variant prior causal probabilities. Applied to 15 UK Biobank traits, Sniff identifies 9.45% additional fine-mapped variants compared to PolyFun-Baseline at posterior inclusion probability (PIP) > 0.8. Sniff-prioritized variants exhibit allele-specific activity in reporter assays and are predicted to have tissue-specific activity in trait-relevant tissues. For most traits, genes nominated by Sniff receive higher scores from the orthogonal gene prioritization method PoPS compared to genes nominated using functional annotations alone.

We introduce a probabilistic framework that adapts expectation maximization to the fluorosequencing measurement process, estimating relative protein abundances with peptide inference results delivered by previously developed peptide-classification tools. The algorithm iteratively updates protein abundances, maximising the likelihood of the observed reads by obtaining more accurate protein abundance estimations. We first assess performance on simulated five-protein mixtures that reflect realistic labelling and system errors. A simple Python implementation processes one million reads in under ten seconds on a standard workstation and lowers the mean absolute error in relative abundance by more than an order of magnitude compared with a uniform-abundance guess, demonstrating robustness in protein inference for small-scale settings. Scalability is then evaluated with simulations of the complete human proteome (20 642 proteins). Ten million reads are processed in less than four hours on a NVIDIA DGX system using one Tesla V100 GPU, confirming that the method remains tractable at proteome scale. Using error rates characteristic of current fluorosequencing, the algorithm produces marginal improvements in relative abundance accuracy. However, when error rates were artificially lowered, estimation error decreased significantly. This result suggests that improvements in fluorosequencing chemistry could directly translate into substantially more accurate quantitative proteomics with this computational framework. Together, these results establish EM-based inference as a scalable model-driven bridge between peptide-level classification and protein-level quantification in fluorosequencing, laying computational groundwork for high-throughput single-molecule proteomics.

This approach explores the relationship between simulated structural dynamics and FRET-relevant observables, providing a framework for further studies that integrate computational models with experimental conformational analysis.

Indeed, models such as AlphaFold, which extracts features from sequence homologs, generally produce more accurate protein structures compared to single sequence-based methods like ESMfold. In contrast, features from sequence homologs are seldom employed for deep learning-based protein function prediction. Although a small number of models also incorporate function labels from sequence homologs, they cannot utilize features extracted from sequence homologs that lack function labels. To address this gap, we propose EZpred, which is the first deep learning model to use unlabeled sequence homologs for protein function prediction. Starting with the target sequence and homologs identified by MMseqs2, EZpred extracts sequence features using the ESMC protein language model. These features are then fed into a deep learning model to predict the Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers of the target protein. For 753 enzymes, the F1-score of EZpred EC number prediction is 4% higher than a similar model that does not use sequence homologs and at least 10% higher that state-of-the-art EC number prediction models. These results demonstrate the strong positive impact of sequence homologs in deep learning-based enzyme function prediction.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

We performed a head-to-head comparison of the adiponectin KO mice that were generated in Dallas, Houston and Osaka.

A complete adiponectin KO model, such as the Dallas KO mouse, exhibits a lower body weight, the highest adipocyte mitochondrial function and displays a susceptibility to DNA damage-mediated lung fibrosis. The reconstitution of globular adiponectin into the Dallas KO mice prompted an increase in body weight and a partial recapitulation of the Osaka KO model transcriptome signature.

Here, we investigate how a large language model (LLM) can leverage such contextuality to capture the dynamics of cellular differentiation. Using single-cell RNA activity data from developing zebrafish embryos, we train a domain-specific LLM, Zebraformer. We demonstrate that the gene and cell embeddings, numerical representations encoding biological meaning, produced by Zebraformer reflect the progression of zebrafish organismal formation, including the emergence of major anatomical domains and cell types. Furthermore, by using the model's attention matrices, which capture how strongly genes influence each other, we observe patterns consistent with the developmental hourglass framework. This framework proposes that the middle phase of embryogenesis is more conserved across species than the early or late phases. At this phylotypic stage, the attention matrices reveal a rise in gene regulatory network complexity, reflected in increased node and edge counts and a narrowing-then-broadening network topology. This stage also shows greater sensitivity to genetic perturbations, as indicated by shifts in gene embeddings, pointing to heightened constraint consistent with the hourglass assumption.

However, few synaptic proteins have been identified that regulate AMPAR plasticity through interactions with AMPAR NTDs. Moreover, the scope of AMPAR NTD interactors that are important for synaptic plasticity remains unknown. Here, we present the dynamic, extracellular interactome for AMPARs during synaptic plasticity.

However, the molecular mechanisms that prevent premature effector T cell programming in humans remain incompletely defined. Signal regulatory protein gamma (SIRP{lambda}) is selectively expressed on T-cells in the human immune system. Notably, genetic variants associated with reduced SIRP{lambda} expression have been linked to increased risk of immune-mediated diseases, including type one diabetes and multiple sclerosis, but the contribution of SIRP{lambda} to CD8 T-cell dysregulation in these contexts remains unclear. Objective: To determine how inter-individual variation in SIRP{lambda} expression influences immune homeostasis and CD8 T-cell effector programming. Methods: Peripheral blood CD8 T-cells from healthy donors were analyzed for SIRP{lambda} expression and associated differentiation phenotypes. Naive CD8 T-cells were purified and subjected to siRNA-mediated knockdown of SIRPG, followed by suboptimal TCR stimulation. Differentiation status, transcription factor expression, and effector cytokine production were measured using flow cytometry. CD47 blockade was used to assess ligand dependency. Results: Low SIRP{lambda} expression on CD8 T-cells was associated with increased frequencies of CD27-CD45ROpositive effector-like and CD27-CD45RO- terminally differentiated CD8 T-cells. SIRPG knockdown induced effector-like differentiation, with increased CD45RO and T-bet expression and elevated TNF- IFN-{gamma}, and Granzyme B production. This effect was not recapitulated by CD47 blockade, suggesting a CD47-independent regulatory mechanism. Conclusion: SIRP{lambda} serves as a negative regulator of CD8 T-cell effector differentiation under suboptimal stimulation.

Depleting B cells through anti-CD20 antibody treatment diminished M2-like macrophage accumulation in inflamed mouse WAT. Mechanistically, we found that the B cell/adipocyte co-cultures led to elevated secretion of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) by primary adipocytes, in part due to TNF-a secretion by activated B cells. Adipocyte-derived MCP-1 resulted in enhanced macrophage migration.

Epetraborole (EBO), a leucyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitor, represents a novel therapeutic approach with a distinct mechanism of action compared to standard-of-care antibiotics. Preclinical studies included MIC determination, pharmacokinetic (PK) profiling, dose range and fractionation studies, and efficacy assessments in a 24-hour post-bacterial challenge model of a murine B. pseudomallei lung infection. EBO demonstrated a clear dose-dependent reduction in lung bacterial burden. Doses [&ge;] 200 mg/kg (achieving AUC0-24 ~110 g{middle dot}h/mL) produced > 1.6 log 10 CFU decreases from the start-of-therapy baseline across all ten B. pseudomalleistrains.

When EBO doses of 600, 300 and 100 mg/kg SC were fractionated by once, twice and three times a day against the B. pseudomallei strain NCTC7383, which represents the MIC100 strain, the efficacy indicated that the pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) driver of epetraborole is total drug exposure (AUC) rather than peak concentration (Cmax) or time above MIC. The inhibition of leucyl-tRNA synthetase represents a unique molecular target, reducing cross-resistance potential with existing {beta}-lactam antibiotics and enabling combination therapy strategies. These findings substantiate EBO as a promising therapeutic option for clinical melioidosis to improve treatment outcomes. Notably, this study represents the first demonstration of in vivo efficacy against a panel of ten genetically and geographically diverse B. pseudomallei strains in a murine model. This unprecedented breadth of strain coverage provides strong evidence of EBOs robust and strain-independent therapeutic potential.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

CSP extracellular domain (ECD) interactions control organ development and physiology and are perturbed in disease states. However, because they cannot be accurately assessed using standard high-throughput screening techniques, they are underrepresented in protein interaction databases. Many ECD interactions are of low affinity, and their detection in vitro requires taking advantage of avidity effects, typically by multimerization of fusion proteins. Assays that test only one or a few interactions in each binding reaction are inadequate for global interactome screening. Here we describe a new multiplex method that uses purified dimeric ECD fusion proteins coupled to 60-mer nanoparticles as soluble prey, and the same dimers coupled to spectrally distinguishable fluorescent microspheres (beads) as bait. We add one prey to a mixture of up to 500 baits in a single well, then use a Luminex FLEXMAP 3D (FM3D) instrument to read out bait identity and prey binding. The FM3D measures the fluorescent dye ratio for each bead and simultaneously determines the amount of epitope-tagged prey bound to that bead. We use the method, denoted as the Multiplex Interactome Assay (MPIA), to analyze a proof-of-concept (PoC) set of 41 CSPs and secreted protens that is derived from larger collections examined in two interactome screens that used ELISA-based binding assays. By analyzing interactions among PoC proteins, we compared the MPIA with earlier screening methods. The MPIA has a dynamic range that is at least 30-fold greater than ELISA-based assays and appears to be more sensitive.

Methods Vastus lateralis muscle biopsy samples were obtained from n=10 people with CKD and n=9 healthy controls matched for age, sex, ethnicity and physical activity. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on all samples. Differential gene expression was assessed using DESeq2 and pathway enrichments analyses were conducted using Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG databases. Results A total of 76 genes were differentially expressed in CKD muscle (FDR < 0.05, |log2, FC| [&ge;] 1), with 62 downregulated and 14 upregulated. Transcriptomic analysis revealed suppression of immune-related pathways, including leukocyte chemotaxis and macrophage-associated signalling (e.g., CD163, CXCL14, MPEG1). GO and KEGG analyses further supported downregulation of immune surveillance and inflammatory pathways. Several genes implicated in muscle regeneration (e.g., MEGF10, PODN, SOX4) were also differentially expressed, suggesting impaired regenerative signalling. Classical markers of myogenesis and protein degradation were unchanged, indicating a blunted rather than overtly inflammatory or catabolic muscle environment.

To understand how this robust coordination occurs, we use the loss of robustness mutant development related myb-like1 (drmy1), which exhibits variable sepal initiation and growth, causing failure of the sepals to close the flower bud. Specifically, drmy1 has overgrown outer (abaxial) sepals and undergrown inner (adaxial) sepals, leading to a large discrepancy in the sizes of different sepals within individual flower buds. Using single cell and spatial RNA-seq, we found changes in expression of key genes related to brassinosteroid (BR) signaling in drmy1, particularly in cell types important to young flower bud development such as epidermal cells, boundary cells, and meristematic cells. Confocal imaging of a BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR1 (BES1) ratiometric reporter confirms that BR signaling is upregulated and more variable in young drmy1 sepals. Subsequently, we found that altering BR signaling in drmy1 by crossing with BR mutants or adding brassinolide (a potent brassinosteroid) or brassinazole (a brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor) can partially rescue this elongation defect by differentially altering the relative growth of the inner and outer sepals. Increasing BR signaling rescues by increasing the growth of the inner sepal but not the outer sepal, while decreasing BR signaling rescues by decreasing the growth of the outer sepal but not the inner sepal. These results suggest that brassinosteroids mediate the robust coordination of the growth rates between inner and outer sepals during early development, ensuring proper flower bud closure.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

To distinguish progressive differentiation from cell type differences, we developed the L-metric, a parameter-free quantification of mutually exclusive gene expression. This analysis revealed spatial organization without explicit encoding, recapitulated known cell type relationships, and identified novel gene expression states and spatial subclusters within cell types. We confirmed that in gastruloids, NMP differentiation occurred through a continuous, spatially coordinated process. We also showed that endothelial precursors exhibited unique spatial organization and had distinct gene expression profiles dependent on their association with anterior somitic or posterior endodermal tissues.

In this study, we develop a conditional knock-in mouse model expressing a mitochondrially targeted variant of the bacterial toxin DarT (mitoAtDarT), which induces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage without affecting the nuclear genome. Ubiquitous expression of mitoAtDarT leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, evidenced by reduced membrane potential and mitochondrial mass, resulting in early embryonic lethality. Employing high-resolution microCT and molecular markers, we demonstrate that mitoAtDarT-expressing embryos fail to undergo normal gastrulation, exhibiting disrupted mesodermal patterning and a complete absence of allantois formation. Surprisingly, defects in lineage specification were evident even earlier, during preimplantation development. Blastocysts expressing mitoAtDarT exhibited reduced total cell numbers, altered trophectoderm-to-inner cell mass ratios, and a striking increase in cells co-expressing lineage markers, indicating a failure in the first cell fate decision.

While generally thought to be a vertebrate-specific innovation, homologous placodes are proposed to exist in non-vertebrate chordates as well. In Ciona robusta, a solitary tunicate, the adult mouth (the oral siphon) is derived from one such \"cranial-like\" placode in the larva, which we term the oral siphon placode (OSP). At embryonic and larval stages, the OSP consists of a small rosette of cells that forms from the neuropore at the anteriormost extent of neural tube closure. While the morphogenesis of the OSP and its physical separation from other surface ectoderm structures have been described in detail, how this is regulated at the molecular level is currently unknown. Here we show the involvement of protocadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in the segregation and structural cohesiveness of the OSP. Protocadherin.e (Pcdhe.e) is expressed specifically in the OSP but not in other surface ectoderm cells. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of Pcdh.e in these cells results in loss of OSP structural integrity and ability to physically separate from other structures derived from the same cell lineage. Overexpression of Pcdh.e throughout the anterior surface ectoderm results in similar loss of a physically separate and distinct OSP territory. Furthermore, we show that Pcdh.e expession in the OSP depends on oral placode-specific transcription factors such as Six1/2 and Pitx.

This process is tightly regulated by cis elements within the pre-mRNA and trans-acting RNA binding proteins that recognize and bind to these elements, thus influencing the spliceosome assembly at adjacent splice sites. Thus, chemical modifications in either the cis-elements or trans factors or both can significantly alter splicing patterns and, thereby, the cellular proteome. Recent studies highlight that many RNA binding proteins (RBPs) are modified at multiple lysine side chains via acetylation, which neutralizes the formal positive charge and disrupts RPBs' ability to participate in RNA recognition, binding and protein-protein interactions. This suggests that lysine acetylation of RPBs may be a novel mode of eukaryotic gene regulation during pre-mRNA processing. To test this, we used the well-characterized polypyrimidine tract binding protein (which is acetylated at several lysine side chains) as a model system to investigate the role of reversible RBP acetylation in regulating alternative-pre mRNA splicing. Using multiple sequence analysis, structure-based electrostatic modeling of RNA-protein interactions, and multi-site glutamine (acetyllysine mimic) and arginine (deacetyllysine mimic) mutants, we show for the first time that for a subset of PTBP1-regulated exons, acetylation at RNA-interacting lysine side chains significantly alters PTBP1 splicing activity.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

We present a scalable, bioinstructive platform based on polylactic acid microparticles with controlled dimpled surface features that direct mesenchymal stem cell differentiation through endogenous topography-mediated mechanotransduction, establishing a mechanistically validated, additive-free platform. These 3D topographical cues drive cytoskeletal reorganisation and induce osteogenesis via canonical Hedgehog signalling. RNA-Seq revealed early significant upregulation of cytoskeletal components and osteochondral transcription factors, including runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and SRY-box transcription factor 9 (SOX9), followed by activation of the insulin growth factor-II pathway and osteogenic commitment. To demonstrate translational potential, two-photon polymerisation lithography was employed to engineer precisely-patterned 3D topographies, inducing graded GLI1 expression without added soluble cues. This establishes a modular, versatile platform for stem cell engineering, offering a topography-driven, non-genetic analogue to mechanogenetics with broad utility for regenerative medicine and human-relevant development of bone models.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

While AlphaFold2-based methods have advanced static structure prediction, modeling multiple conformation states with both accuracy and efficiency remains challenging. We present AlphaFlex, an innovative framework that integrates flexible residue prediction with a directed masking strategy for multiple sequence alignments. By selectively relaxing co-evolutionary constraints in dynamic regions, AlphaFlex enables accurate prediction of biologically relevant states while preserving structural fidelity. Benchmarking on 69 apo-holo pairs from the CoDNaS dataset, including enzymes, binding proteins, and chaperones, reveals AlphaFlex's superior performance in both flexible residue identification and multiple conformation prediction. Comparative analysis against AF-Cluster, AF2-conformations, and AlphaFlow demonstrates AlphaFlex's significant advantage, achieving the highest success rate (42%) in accurately predicting apo/holo structures (TM-score >0.95 for both states) while consistently outperforming these methods in reproducing both apo and holo conformations. Notably, AlphaFlex maintains robust performance for membrane proteins, resolving inward- and outward-facing conformations with equal fidelity. Case studies further reveal its unique ability to sample physically plausible intermediate states along transition pathways. These results establish AlphaFlex as a pivotal computational tool for mapping protein conformational landscapes, with promising potential to accelerate structure-based therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Results We present an enhanced version of souporcell capable of demultiplexing up to 64 donors. The method uses 10x merge for initialization, K-Harmonic Means for robust clustering, and iterative refinement with reinitialization of low-quality clusters and locking of high-quality ones.

Our findings suggest that the 40S subunit regulates DHX29's NTPase activity through an activation mechanism resembling the G-patch protein regulation of DEAH helicases. Moreover, our model supports a 3' to 5' translocase mechanism, in which DHX29 transiently pulls the mRNA opposite to the scanning direction, destabilizing stable stem-loops trapped in the mRNA channel and allowing scanning to resume.

Using differential gene expression profiles, we identified three criteria to suspect bistability: two potential attractors, a hysteresis behavior between their transitions, and the presence of potential modules of coregulated genes. This was further confirmed by proteomics data pointing to mutually exclusive and time-dependent profiles of gene expression. By network simplification and creation of a novel pipeline for parameter estimation in bistable models, we obtained a minimal model of inflammatory transitions in which we identified ultrasensitivity and hysteresis.

To address this, we compared the response of lymphoid tissue (LT) Th2 cells from helminth parasite-infected mice to stimulation by IL-33 versus through the T cell receptor via anti-CD3/CD28.

Most bacteria synthesize isoprenoids through either the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway or the mevalonate (MEV) pathway, while a small subset encodes both pathways, including the pathogen Mycobacterium marinum (Mm). It is unclear whether the MEV pathway is functional in Mm, or why Mm encodes seemingly redundant metabolic pathways. Here we show that the MEP pathway is essential in Mm while the MEV pathway is dispensable in culture, with the {Delta}MEV mutant having no growth defect in axenic culture but a competitive growth defect compared to WT Mm. We found that the MEV pathway does not play a role in ex vivo or in vivo infection but does play a role in survival of peroxide stress. Metabolite profiling revealed that modulation of the MEV pathway causes compensatory changes in the concentration of MEP intermediates DOXP and CDP-ME, suggesting that the MEV pathway is functional and that the pathways interact at the metabolic level. Finally, the MEV pathway is upregulated early in the shift down to hypoxia, suggesting that it may provide metabolic flexibility to this bacterium. Interestingly we found that our complemented strains, which vary in copy number of the polyprenyl synthetase idsB2, responded differently to peroxide and UV stresses, suggesting a role for this gene as a determinant of downstream prenyl phosphate metabolism. Together, these findings suggest that MEV may serve as an anaplerotic pathway to make isoprenoids under stress conditions.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

We found that macropinocytosis is increased in human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) derived from IPF patients. The inhibition of macropinocytosis with 5-(n-ethyl-n-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA) significantly inhibited profibrotic responses in IPF-derived and TGF-beta1-stimulated HLFs.

Temperature (between +1.0oC and +1.7oC) and mosquito abundance (between +5% and +10%) were predicted to increase during the transmission season across the scenarios.

These effects were most pronounced early in the season and in scenarios characterised by a high temperature increase and little concern about environmental change. Changes in outbreak risk differed between locations due to spatial variation in changes in host and vector abundance Conclusions Across a range of possible future scenarios, USUV and WNV outbreaks are expected to become larger, grow faster, and last longer.

Among insects, cold-adapted ants, which are successful terrestrial insects in temperate and boreal ecosystems, rely on complex circannual life cycles to survive multiple consecutive winters. Following winter reactivation, colonies enter a fixed developmental phase whose duration is controlled by Kipyatkov's sand-glass device, an endogenous programmed timer that ultimately enforces a new dormancy period for colonies after a set period, even under permissive light or temperature cues. Here, using five temperate ant species, we leveraged this system to tease apart the contribution of intrinsic seasonal programming and extrinsic thermal cues on worker cold tolerance, metabolic rates, and metabolomic profiles. We show that obligate colony-level dormancy alone is sufficient to modulate both the critical thermal minimum (CTmin) and the temperature causing 50% mortality during acute cold exposure (LTe50), and further interacts with cold acclimation to shape worker phenotypic cold tolerance. While colony-level dormancy was only associated with limited metabolomic reorganization, cold acclimation triggered the accumulation of metabolites potentially involved in osmotic balance and membrane reorganization. Our results highlight a circannual cycle of endogenous cold hardening that operates independently of environmental exposure in temperate ants, providing new insight into the physiological adaptations underpinning the evolutionary success of this insect family in highly seasonal climates.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

New long-read sequencing provides opportunities to develop telomere-to-telomere resources to detect cryptic variation, including CNVs, which are currently missed in traditional analyses. Integrating this information can improve genomic prediction for breeding and provide insights into the evolutionary basis of important traits. Results Our analysis of 78 telomere-to-telomere long-read haplotypes identified more than twice as many KCS genes as previously reported, along with numerous intragenic non-synonymous substitutions. Random forest predictive models highlighted the importance of Potri.010G079500 in producing very long chain alkenes; however, its absence did not predict previously reported alkene-deficient phenotypes. Instead, alkene levels are best predicted by the combinations of KCS copies. Amino acid substitutions clustered around ligand and donor binding pockets, suggesting they contribute to differing wax cuticle composition. Finally, each KCS gene and copy was linked to a helitron transposon. A phylogenetic analysis indicates they are the evolutionary mechanism for generating KCS tandem arrays.

Strikingly, this finding is specific to the cytochrome bc1 and cytochrome c pathway and does not extend to other branches of the electron transport chain.

Besides, also as a nutritional supplement, CUR enables inflammatory prevention and enhance the combined efficacy of it with chemotherapy. Such characteristic of safeguarding normal organisms while treating or alleviating diseases is manifested as a common bidirectional regulation and its hormetin effect of phenolic compounds, particularly in response to stress. In this redox process, two antioxidant transcription factors Nrf1 and Nrf2 (encoded by Nfe2l1 and Nfe2l2, respectively) play distinct and crucial roles. Thereby, we investigated their expression profiles of genes regulated by Nrf1 and Nrf2 in different signaling responses modulated by CUR. The resulting evidence has been provided, demonstrating that distinctive cellular metabolisms, molecular pathways, and signaling mechanisms account for Nrf1 and Nrf2, as drug targets. Both factors also play diverse roles in the anticancer effects of CUR on HepG2 cells and xenograft mice. However, the effect of CUR on xenograft tumors in vivo is not entirely satisfactory, although such anti-cancer effect was achieved by promoting Nrf1 expression, it appeared more reliant on Nrf2 (particularly in the absence of Nrf1). As such, we unexpectedly discovered there is not a simple regulatory relationship between CUR and Nrf2. This is supported by substantial inhibition of Nrf2 by CUR in the aberrantly proliferating Nrf1-/- cells, even albeit this chemical stimulates the expression of Nrf1 and Nrf2 in wild-type cells.

We review evidence for the evolution of arboreality within lineages of early mammals and their stem relatives (Synapsida) while also emphasizing the uncertainty of locomotor inferences of fossil lineages. An improved understanding of the evolutionary origins and prevalence of arboreality in early mammals requires robust links between morphological traits and locomotor behaviors that can be applied to fossils. To this end, we use a large comparative dataset of linear measurements taken on extant mammalian postcranial specimens to evaluate the skeletal proxies that best differentiate arboreality from other locomotor modes. Consistent with previous research, we find that measures of digit length and elbow proportions are especially powerful predictors of climbing. Locomotor predictions based on single measurements or ratios are improved when phylogeny is incorporated into models. Nonetheless, combining multiple functionally relevant traits into our models yields robust predictions of locomotor mode even without incorporating phylogenetic information--this is especially encouraging for fossil groups with unstable phylogenies. We test these locomotor proxies in three early-mammalian case studies--Multituberculata, Plesiadapiformes, and early Theria. We find that multituberculates had a wide locomotor breadth whereas plesiadapiforms all had a high probability of climbing, consistent with previous studies. However, some Mesozoic therians in our sample are predicted to be ground-dwellers, conflicting with the hypothesis that the ancestral therian was scansorial or arboreal. The predictive tools presented here will improve locomotor inferences for small mammals, further illuminating the prevalence and importance of arboreality in early mammalian evolution.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

We explore how folding of T1, an intersubunit recognition domain that ensures correct isoform assembly, is modulated by molecular determinants in the Kv subunit. Specifically, we focus on the T1-S1 linker and its highly conserved C-terminal sequence, S0. Using pegylation, a mass-tagging strategy, inter- and intrasubunit crosslinking, we define the molecular determinants of T1-S1 linker accessibility and location. Our findings show that i) dynamic protein-lipid and protein-protein linker interfaces exist, ii) the presence of a T1 domain and its conformation (monomer versus tetramer) impact linker properties, iii) helical formation of S0 occurs in early biogenic stages and does not require the presence of membranes, iv) a core recognition domain (T2) increases T1 dimerization efficiency and promotes tetramer formation, and v) as few as 12 native linker residues enable T1 tetramerization. These findings differ from canonical models and suggest that domain plasticity for Kv1.3 contributes to biogenesis and may underlie domain-domain communication in Kv function.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Despite a surge of new functional information about EVs, we still lack a basic understanding of how endogenous EV levels are controlled to regulate inter-organ signaling. New flow cytometry technology has allowed us to study the regulation of circulating, endogenous EVs from metabolically relevant cell types like adipocytes. From this, we provide evidence for a paradigm of EV regulation where tissue resident immune cells, predominantly macrophages, clear EVs released by local tissue cells or EVs entering the tissue from circulation, an activity that determines circulating EV levels. In obesity, EV uptake by adipose tissue immune cells is reduced, concomitant with increased circulating adipocyte-specific EVs (adipoEVs) and reduced EV clearance rates. AdipoEVs are significantly elevated in mouse circulation from one day to 20 weeks of high-fat feeding. In humans we found that adipocyte EV levels negatively correlate with whole-body and liver insulin sensitivity and are not associated with adipose mass. This work suggests that tissue resident immune cells act as a gatekeeper for tissue EV entry into circulation and are thereby a major regulator of inter-organ EV signaling.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

I.; Cox, A.; Grazioso, K.; Killen, S.

Little is known about the patterns of physiological traits among fishes within social groups and the mechanisms that promote these patterns, which could elucidate the drivers of group composition and their downstream ecological and evolutionary impacts. Here, in the gregarious damselfish species Chromic viridis, we examined inter-group differences in whole-animal physiological traits and the tendency for fish to move either within sites (i.e., sections of continuous reef) or among habitats (i.e., reefs separated by sandy substratum) to a new social group. Using oxygen uptake as a proxy for aerobic metabolic rate, we found significant differences in maximum metabolic rate (MMR) and aerobic scope (AS) among schools from different habitats, with these traits higher in habitats with faster water flow rates. However, we found no differences in any metabolic traits (standard metabolic rate, SMR, MMR, AS) between groups from the same site. These trends could stem from a range of mechanisms, as mark-recapture studies of this species indicated a willingness to migrate to a new social group in over 30% of recollected fish. However, there were no effects of either body size or perceived habitat risk on the distance moved or movement type (i.e., over coral or sand). Our results indicate that, in social species, a combination of mechanisms may influence phenotypic differences among groups over different spatial scales.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

The CCM consumes 15-30% of photosynthetically-generated ATP, making its regulation critical for cellular energy balance. Here, we identify a nuclear repressor of the CCM in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. A pull-down screen for interacting partners of the master activator CCM1/CIA5 revealed an uncharacterized protein that co-purifies with CCM1 even after high-salt washes. This protein, designated CCM1-binding protein 1 (CBP1), combines a CobW/CobW_C GTP-binding metallochaperone module with a WW domain characteristic of protein-protein interactions. CBP1 colocalizes with CCM1 in the nucleus regardless of CO2 conditions, and the two proteins interact in vivo. CRISPR/Cas9-based disruption of CBP1 does not affect growth or CCM induction under CO2 limitation but derepresses 27 of 41 CCM1-dependent low-CO2 inducible genes under high-CO2 conditions. These include the periplasmic and intracellular carbonic anhydrases (CAH1, LCIB) and inorganic carbon transporters/channels (LCIA, LCI1, BST1, BST3). Consistently, cbp1 mutants accumulate higher levels of CAH1 and LCIB proteins and exhibit a 40% increase in inorganic carbon affinity under high-CO2 conditions; this phenotype is rescued by CBP1 complementation or by acetazolamide treatment. These results demonstrate that CBP1 prevents unnecessary CCM activity when CO2 is abundant, acting upstream of both transporter/channel and carbonic anhydrase modules. Our findings suggest a regulatory mechanism potentially linking zinc-dependent protein chemistry to CCM gene repression, providing insights into energy-efficient CO2 sensing in aquatic photosynthetic organisms.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Here we compared predictions for how sediment chemistry and microbial communities influenced methane emissions from 19 littoral sites in the UK varying in organic matter sources and microbial composition. Our approach was to compare multiple predictions to explain methane fluxes from sediment chemistry and microbial composition using path analysis. We found that the prediction that organic matter composition, namely the concentration of polyphenolics, controls methane emissions by changing electrochemical conditions to favour certain methanogen taxa was hundreds of times better supported than predictions involving abundances of all methanogens and methanotrophic bacteria, methanogen diversity, or other physicochemical conditions. Diffusive CH4 fluxes were estimated to increase by 3.1- to 16.6-times (95% confidence interval) with increasing polyphenolic concentrations, almost entirely because they lower reduction-oxidation potentials that shift methanogen composition towards widespread taxa positively associated with methanogenesis. Rather than strongly inhibiting methane-producing microorganisms, our results suggest polyphenolics change reduction-oxidation potentials to favour acetoclastic and methylotrophic methanogens.

In this study, we use a mathematical model of the muscle-tendon-skeleton interface to design a biohybrid muscle-tendon unit composed of tissue engineered muscle coupled to adhesive tough hydrogel tendons. We show how tuning tendon stiffness and pre-tension modulates actuator performance, measure fatigue characteristics of our actuators over >7000 cycles, and tune skeleton stiffness to increase force transmission muscles to skeletons by ~29X. Furthermore, we demonstrate an ~11X improvement in power-to-weight ratio of muscle-tendon units as compared to previous demonstrations of robots powered by muscles alone.

Here, we present a 3D multicellular spheroid-based model of the human hepatobiliary junction, the interface between hepatocytes and cholangiocytes often disrupted in liver disease that is required for directing bile excreted by hepatocytes into the biliary ductal system. Building on advances in organoid and spheroid engineering, we co-aggregate primary human hepatocytes and intrahepatic cholangiocytes into adult hepatobiliary organoids (aHBOs) that structurally connect and functionally transport bile. aHBOs directionally transport bile from hepatocyte bile canaliculi to cholangiocyte-lined ductules, which we visualize through a high-throughput imaging assay. Hepatobiliary junction formation and bile flow dynamics are quantified over time using fluorescent bile acid analogs and AI-assisted image analysis. When subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation, aHBOs recapitulate features of biliary dysfunction that mimics the cholestasis and ischemia-reperfusion injury that complicates liver transplant. Our findings suggest that 1) a reversible reduction in hepatocyte canalicular function under hypoxia, followed by 2) selective cholangiocyte death upon reoxygenation, are processes that potentially contribute to biliary dysfunction upon ischemic injury.

Actomyosin bundles exhibit diverse mechano-adaptive responses to external mechanical cues. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such adaptability remain poorly understood. In this study, we employed experiments and agent-based simulations to illuminate how actomyosin bundles adapt to complex mechanical perturbations. Our experiments revealed that individual stress fibers isolated from cells, and thus operating independently of cellular regulation, exhibited buckling in response to rapid compressions following stretch, accompanied by gradual recovery to a straight configuration. Such buckling was not observed under slow compression, indicating that the bundles exhibit rate-dependent adaptive responses. These findings demonstrate that mechano-adaptive behavior is an intrinsic property of actomyosin bundles. Simulations successfully reproduced these rate-dependent behaviors intrinsic to actomyosin bundles and identified key factors determining the dependence. Bundle stiffness influenced the buckling-induced curvature but had little effect on the time required for recovery to straight configuration. Motor density did not alter the recovery time but significantly influenced the magnitude of tensile forces developed after full recovery. The recovery time was primarily governed by the motor walking rate and the applied compressive strain rate.

Our results demonstrated that granulin (GRN) positive macrophages facilitated the transition from adenocarcinoma to a multilineage state with mesenchymal and stem-like traits by activating intra-tumoral NF-{kappa}B signaling. Subsequently, the multilineage clones induced macrophages to highly express granulin through the secretion of CSF1, forming a positive feedback cell communication loop. Next, we validated the biological function of granulin in mediating epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro. Additionally, organoids drug resistance assay demonstrated that granulin drove resistance to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted drug (enzalutamide). Moreover, pharmacologic blockade of the CSF-1/CSF-1R axis in TRAMP mouse models reduced the expression of GRN in macrophages and suppressed the formation of multilineage subclones in prostate malignant cells.

Mitochondrial oxidative stress (mtOS) has been implicated in these changes. We previously demonstrated that NOX4 expression and activity increase with age in cardiovascular cells, promoting mtOS and vascular dysfunction. This study investigates whether NOX4-driven mtOS and DNA damage promote AAA development through vascular cell reprogramming. Methods: We used mitochondria-targeted Nox4-overexpressing (Nox4TG) mice with an Apoe-/- background to model Angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced AAA. AAA incidence, aortic morphology, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, DNA damage markers, and wall remodeling parameters were assessed in Apoe-/-, Apoe-/-/Nox4TG, and Apoe-/-/Nox4-/- mice. Vascular cell populations were analyzed by spectral flow cytometry and gene expression profiling. In vitro, Ang II-treated SMCs from wild-type, Nox4TG, and Nox4-/- mice were evaluated for mtROS, DNA damage, and activation of inflammatory pathways. Results: Apoe-/-/Nox4TG mice exhibited the highest AAA incidence, aortic dilation, ROS levels, DNA damage, and inflammation, while Apoe-/-/Nox4-/- mice were most protected. Macrophage-like SMCs increased, while contractile SMCs decreased in Nox4TG aortas. Ang II-treated Nox4TG SMCs showed elevated mtROS, DNA damage, and cGAS-STING activation.

Decidual cells play a crucial role by secreting various factors that support essential events in forming a functional placenta, including uterine angiogenesis and the differentiation and development of trophoblasts. We previously reported that the conditional ablation of the transcription factor RUNX1 in the mouse uterus leads to subfertility due to insufficient maternal angiogenesis and impaired trophoblast differentiation. In this study, we examined the role of RUNX1 in facilitating communication mechanisms among human decidual cells and other cell types present in the pregnant uterus. We demonstrated that RUNX1 regulates the conserved HIF2-RAB27B pathway in primary human endometrial stromal cells (HESC) during decidualization, which promotes the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by these cells. Consequently, the depletion of RUNX1 in HESC led to reduced EV secretion. Mass spectrometry identified several cargo proteins in decidual EVs, including ANGPTL2 and IGF2, which could regulate angiogenesis or trophoblast differentiation. We found that RUNX1 directly regulates their expression, resulting in partial changes to these cargoes when it is absent. We observed that delivering EVs lacking ANGPTL2 or IGF2 to human endothelial cells significantly decreased the formation of vascular networks compared to introducing control EVs carrying these factors. Furthermore, adding IGF2-depleted EVs to human trophoblast cells inhibited their differentiation into the extravillous trophoblast lineage.

However, it does not address the subjective nature of temporal perception and leads to inconsistencies in complex systems. This paper introduces the Recursive Entropic Time framework, a theory proposing that subjective time is not fixed but instead emerges from neural systems involved in interpretation and association. We hypothesize that the brain uses a divided system for processing time. Primary sensory cortices handle objective clock-based time, while higher-order associative cortices construct subjective time through a mechanism in which the rate of temporal flow is inversely influenced by the amount of information being processed. To test this theory, we conducted a two-part investigation. In the first part, we used a public dataset involving brain scans of subjects under the influence of a hallucinogenic substance. This revealed that the Recursive Entropic Time model had greater effectiveness in associative regions of the brain compared to primary sensory areas. This finding suggested a region-specific effect rather than a global one. In the second part, we examined brain activity during a temporal reproduction task and analyzed two trials where participants produced nearly identical time durations. Despite the behavioral similarity, the information processing differed between the trials. The Recursive Entropic Time model accurately predicted these outcomes by reflecting internal durations derived from the information load. These findings support Recursive Entropic Time as a falsifiable and mechanistic explanation of how the brain constructs subjective time. We argue that time, as it is experienced, is not a simple reflection of external reality but a mental construction shaped by higher cognition. This framework provides a measurable and testable method for understanding subjective time and may lead to applications such as brain-based time atlases and insights into cognitive disorders.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Yet evidence of cross-species differences in neural coding continues to mount. Our ability to reconcile these similarities and differences has been inherently limited by the qualitative nature of our cross-species comparisons. To overcome this limitation, here we combine recent technical and theoretical advances to characterize the representational geometry of human spatial memory during a diverse set of environmental deformations and compare this geometry to that of mouse CA1. Across three untethered immersive virtual reality experiments (n > 100 participants per experiment), we find that deformations induce compounding local distortions in human spatial memory. These distortions yield a representational geometry which closely resembles a change-resistant version of that of mouse hippocampal CA1 during analogous deformations. The geometries of mouse CA1 subpopulations with higher firing rates, spatial tuning stability, and spatial tuning specificity all better resembled that of human spatial memory. The precision, but not accuracy, of human spatial memory also modulated cross-species resemblance. The local impact of deformations scaled up when humans navigated a larger environment, preserving representational geometry and cross-species resemblance. Neither geometry nor cross-species resemblance depended on the human visual advantage during retrieval. Together, these results establish a common cross-species resemblance in the representational geometry of mouse CA1 and human spatial memory during environmental deformations, with a notable difference in the resistance to change between these assays.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

We used untargeted serum metabolomics to profile the immunometabolic landscape of ferrets after SARS-CoV-2 infection and DNA-/protein-based vaccination. Ferrets were vaccinated with either a multigenic DNA vaccine encoding SARS-CoV-2 RBD, M, and N (OC2), an N-only DNA vaccine (OC12), a recombinant spike protein with QS-21 adjuvant (S+QS21), or a hepatitis B/D control construct (Hep-B/D), and subsequently challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Serum was analyzed longitudinally at baseline, post-vaccination, and post-challenge. SARS-CoV-2 infection induced broad metabolic reprogramming, involving TCA cycle, glutathione metabolism, and nucleotide turnover, reflecting inflammation and cellular activation. OC2 vaccination induced strong metabolic shifts in amino acid and mitochondrial pathways despite low pre-challenge anti-S antibodies. Post-challenge, these shifts extended to redox and nucleotide pathways, correlating with robust anti-S and very strong anti-N antibody responses and complete viral clearance in BAL, but with marked airway pathology, consistent with T cell-mediated clearance of infected cells. S+QS21 and OC12 induced distinct, immunogen-specific signatures with partial protection, while Hep-B/D showed minimal systemic engagement. Metabolite-antibody correlations revealed vaccine-specific associations, highlighting lipid and amino acid pathways as potential immunogenicity biomarkers. Overlap and heatmap analyses showed that metabolic trajectories reflect both the magnitude and quality of immune training. These findings underscore the value of systems vaccinology in resolving mechanistic differences in vaccine responses and support metabolic profiling as a tool for evaluating immune efficacy in preclinical vaccine studies.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

J.", "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of pneumonia. Importantly, the extent and impact of changes in the infected airway on bacterial nutrient availability and gene expression are not known. Utilizing untargeted UPLC-ESI-MS/MS metabolomics, we comprehensively characterized the metabolic landscape in the airway across early, mid, and severe stages of pneumococcal pneumonia. This revealed that dynamic shifts in metabolites occurred during pneumonia, with an initial influx of metabolites at the early stage, followed by declines as the disease progressed. Specific host metabolic perturbations were indicative of purine dysregulation, cellular stress, and outright tissue injury. Levels of glucose, a known modulator of pneumococcal capsule production, were highest at early disease stage, and then declined as the disease progressed, overlaying general metabolite trends. Concurrent bacterial transcriptome profiling was performed using a NanoString nCounter custom panel of 66 genes selected for their importance to metabolism, virulence, and stress response; 9% of which had disease-stage significant differences in gene expression. This analysis revealed remarkably high expression of spxB, the gene encoding pyruvate oxidase, at the severe stage of pneumonia compared to the mid-stage pneumonia, consistent with a drop in glucose levels and indicative of a shift towards mixed fermentation and the increased production of hydrogen peroxide. Our study improves our understanding of how pneumococcal infection alters the lung environment, driving profound metabolic shifts that, in turn, influence bacterial phenotypes. This detailed understanding of host-pathogen metabolic interactions offers valuable insights into novel therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

R.; Tran, A. K.; Gieske, M. F.; Kinkel, L. L.", "abstract": "Competition for limited carbon resources in the soil can drive complex microbe-microbe dynamics including selection for antagonistic resource competitors. Lignin, one of the main components of plant residue, is one source of carbon input into soil. However, the highly recalcitrant nature of lignin requires degrading organisms to invest in extracellular enzymes, whose breakdown products are susceptible to poaching by opportunistic competitors. Here, we tested two hypotheses: 1) lignin-degrading Streptomyces are more inhibitory than non-degrading isolates, and 2) competition for lignin contributes to the frequency and intensity of antagonistic phenotypes. We collected 133 Streptomyces from the soil of 55-year corn monocultures that had been managed in a +/- fertilizer by +/- residue removal factorial design. Using a subset of 24 lignin-utilizing and 24 non-utilizing isolates we measured the inhibition of each isolate against ten Streptomyces standards. Lignin-degrading Streptomyces had larger mean zones of inhibition than non-lignin-degrading populations, but only in plots where residue was retained. Among non-lignin-degrading Streptomyces, there was no difference in the frequency or intensity of antagonistic phenotypes with fertilizer or residue practices. Our results suggest that competition for byproducts of lignin degradation by lignin-degrading Streptomyces imposes selection for antagonistic phenotypes in habitats with regular residue inputs, but not in non-lignin-enriched soils. This work has potential implications for the development of antibiotic-mediated disease suppressive soils, the survival of plant pathogens within residue, and the structure and function of the soil microbial community.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Consequently, clinicians usually prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics, promoting the selection of multidrug-resistant bacteria. In this study, we investigate the application of machine learning techniques to detect ampicillin susceptibility directly from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. This technique could enable an earlier optimised treatment in infections with ampicillin-susceptible E. faecium. Methods Two datasets of clinical E. faecium MALDI-TOF spectra and their resistance phenotype were analysed: our own Technical University of Munich (TUM) dataset and the publicly available MS-UMG dataset. We tested logistic regression and LightGBM models on each datasets via nested cross-validation and explored transferability on the respective other dataset. Results LightGBM demonstrated slightly better performance than logistic regression in identifying susceptible isolates in the TUM dataset (area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) 0.907 +/- 0.016 vs 0.902 +/- 0.030) as well as in the MS-UMG dataset (AUPRC 0.902 +/- 0.029 vs 0.899 +/- 0.054). External validation demonstrated good model transferability (AUPRC of 0.784 +/- 0.039 when trained on MS-UMG; 0.804 +/- 0.013 when trained on TUM). SHAP analysis consistently identified a top-ranked spectral feature corresponding to a peak at an m/z of 5091.66 in resistant isolate spectra. Conclusion This study demonstrates that logistic regression and LightGBM models can identify ampicillin-susceptible E. faecium isolates from MALDI-TOF spectra and generalise well to unseen datasets. While clinical implementation would currently still require confirmatory testing, the addition of larger datasets in the near future will support the development of more robust machine learning models.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

The combination of sertraline with frontline TB drugs has shown excellent promise in the murine models of infection in imparting better bacterial control and increasing host survival. We tested if the addition of sertraline worked to increase bacterial clearance in the random bred guinea pig model of TB infection that mimics the inter individual heterogeneity observed in the human response to infection. The combination of sertraline and frontline TB drugs effectively reduced bacterial burdens in the tissues of guinea pigs significantly better than the drugs alone with a marked betterment of lung histopathology. In order to evaluate the effect of sertraline on the pharmacodynamic properties of TB drugs, concentrations of the drugs were estimated in tissues at different time intervals over a period of 24h of administration to rats. Overall, addition of sertraline did not alter TB drug distribution or clearance from the animals, although enriching drug amounts transiently between 3-6 h in the different tissues. We thus highlight the advantage of an adjunct TB therapy with the inclusion of sertraline, an FDA approved antidepressant, in improving the PKPD of TB drugs and imparting better infection control in diverse models of infection.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

S.", "abstract": "Aspergillosis caused by Aspergillus fumigatus is a clinical issue of such severity that the World Health Organization has designated this organism as 1 of the 4 most critical fungi to study. Progress in A. fumigatus has been limited by the availability of genetic tools with which to study this filamentous fungus. Currently available means of altering the dosage of genes and gene products include construction of disruption mutants as well as regulated promoters. These are powerful techniques but somewhat limited for the analysis of essential genes. Here we describe a new method that permits regulated proteolysis of any A. fumigatus protein that can be made as a fusion protein to the well-described Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) of Aequorea victoria. A GFP fusion protein of interest can be targeted for degradation using a single-chain antibody called a nanobody that recognizes GFP (GFPNb). This GFPNb is in turn fused to an E3 ligase protein called Rnf4 from rat that efficiently ubiquitinates target proteins. A fusion gene was constructed under control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter that produced a GFPNb-Rnf4 fusion protein in A. fumigatus. Here we show that production of this GFPNb-Rnf4 protein led to the rapid proteolysis of a variety of GFP fusion proteins. Additionally, we found that some GFP fusion proteins triggered a corresponding genomic response when their degradation was induced while others were simply degraded. These studies provide a new means to directly regulate protein levels in A. fumigatus and generate new alleles of genes exposing the underlying regulatory circuitry.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Therefore, there is an urgent need for more accessible and rapid monitoring methods that will ultimately allow for restoration programmes to be implemented. In this study, we deployed environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding as a fish monitoring tool in the Mersey estuarine system (UK), where ecosystem productivity has been severely impacted by water quality degradation since the Industrial Revolution. Monthly water samples were collected over a year (2023-2024) throughout the estuary, covering saline, brackish and freshwater zones. Overall, 69 species of fish were detected, increasing the number of known species within the estuary in comparison to both historical and contemporary records (46 and 39, respectively), with a generally higher observed richness within the upper estuary sampled zones where the water chemistry is predominantly freshwater. Notably, we identified several species returning to the system for the first time since pre-industrial times. Peak species richness was recorded during the winter season (December-February). Species compositions varied significantly by month and spatially by zone within months, but not when grouped seasonally. Furthermore, around ~15% of the species detected were diadromous, with the endangered Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, for example, being frequently detected during its key migratory period. This study highlights the resurgence in fish diversity in a once biologically depleted estuarine ecosystem and demonstrates how eDNA metabarcoding can be implemented for detecting historically absent species, thereby enhancing restoration monitoring efforts globally.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Examples are given in 6 insect families: Culicidae, Glossinidae, Muscidae, Psychodidae, Reduviidae and Tabanidae.     We compared the classification accuracy of complete landmark configurations (from 10 to 22 landmarks) with smaller subsets of them. In all of these examples where landmark-based geometric morphometry was effective in separating morphologically close taxa, the total number of landmarks was not as effective as some significantly smaller subsets. To find such performing subsets, we used a random approach. Thus, for each number of landmarks (subsets), we examined a random sample of their many possible combinations. This random search was compared to a simpler approach, called the hierarchical method, based on the contribution of each landmark to the overall distance between shapes. Both procedures have been integrated into the XYOM online software, providing accessible tools for efficient landmark selection and improved morphometric analysis.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

This study aims to examine the role of function in determining skull shape in crocodyliformes, and assesses the difference in stress resistance between oreinirostral and platyrostral taxa. We hypothesise that in the absence of hydrodynamic constraints, oreinirostral taxa have skulls that are better suited for resisting feeding induced loads. Using finite element analysis (FEA), we evaluated biomechanical performance in oreinirostral notosuchian taxa Baurusuchus salgadoensis, Montealtosuchus arrudacamposi and Caipirasuchus paulistanus; compared to the extant platyrostral Alligator mississippiensis, Crocodylus niloticus, and Paleosuchus palpebrosus.

Diatoms, in particular, engage in diverse relationships with bacteria, ranging from mutualism to pathogenicity. However, the mechanisms governing the shift between these interactions and how they are shaped by host physiology and environmental context, remain unclear. To address this, we investigated how the diatom growth phase influences the interaction between a newly isolated Alteromonas macleodii strain from the Equatorial Pacific and the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. We demonstrated that A. macleodii algicidal activity depends on the diatoms growth phase, defensive capacity, and substrate availability. The algicidal effect manifests either during the diatoms stationary phase or with an external source of organic carbon, implicating organic matter availability as a key driver. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that A. macleodii shifts from motility-associated to growth-associated gene expression patterns in response to the diatoms growth phase and co-culture duration. Filtrate assays and fluorescence microscopy suggest a two-stage infection model: initial bacterial motility and exudate secretion induce diatom death, followed by bacterial aggregation around cellular debris. Comparative transcriptomics of A. macleodii with other algal hosts highlights host-specific bacterial responses, underscoring the context-dependent nature of these interactions.

This non-growing subpopulation exhibits greater tolerance to ethambutol. Clinical strains displayed higher proportions of growth-arrested cells under both neutral and acidic conditions, suggesting that growth arrest serves as a bet-hedging strategy during infection. Though the PhoPR two-component system contributes to regulating this non-growing state, we show that it is a partial regulator of the non-growing bacterial subpopulation and that additional transcriptional regulators are involved.

Here, we conduct a comprehensive phylogenomic analysis of 570 publicly available AAB genomes. We find that the ~170My evolutionary history of this group is concordant with the rise of angiosperms, corbiculate bees, and the consequential accelerated availability of environmental carbohydrates. Unlike other ferment-associated microbes, ferment-associated AAB have exclusively evolved from clades inhabiting flowers and fruits, but not insect hosts. Genomic features are similar in plant- and ferment-associated AAB, yet markers of early adaptation to ferments are also present. Conversely, social insect-associated AAB have reduced genome sizes, which may have limited their functional capability to disperse into ferments. Plant- and ferment-associated AAB coincide in the ability to metabolise diverse plant carbohydrates, though both have adapted to produce habitat-specific carbohydrate-active enzymes. In contrast, metabolic capacity is reduced in social insect-associated AAB.

We demonstrate that early pre-rRNA processing is particularly sensitive to stress induced by environmentally relevant heavy metals. Surprisingly, our analysis shows that 5' and 3' end processing can be uncoupled in human cells, with 3' end cleavage occurring independently of 5' end processing. We further show that classical inducers of endoplasmic reticulum stress suppress ribosomal protein synthesis without inhibiting rRNA transcription, leading to an imbalance between these essential components of ribosome assembly.

T.; Moayedi, M.", "abstract": "The neurobiology of adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), particularly functional brain network connectivity, remain poorly understood. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) can reveal frequency-specific network dynamics given its high temporal resolution. Here, we investigated intrinsic functional connectivity differences between adults with ADHD (n = 24) and healthy controls (n = 44) using MEG data from the Open MEG Archive (OMEGA) dataset. We employed source reconstruction (Destrieux atlas), weighted phase-lag index (wPLI) connectivity across six frequency bands, graph theory metrics (Characteristic Path Length (CPL), node strength, clustering coefficient), and network-based statistics (NBS). We observed widespread hypo-connectivity in the high-gamma band (50-150 Hz) in adults with ADHD compared to controls. NBS identified a significant high-gamma sub-network, predominantly involving dorsal and ventral attention networks (DAN/VAN) and default mode network (DMN) nodes centered around a left fusiform gyrus hub, where all constituent connections exhibited consistently lower connectivity in the ADHD group. Globally, this was reflected in reduced gamma network integration (longer CPL) within the DAN and VAN. Locally, reduced high-gamma clustering was observed in VAN nodes (e.g., insula) and reduced node strength in a DAN region (postcentral sulcus). Predictive modeling using ElasticNet regression confirmed the importance of high-gamma metrics, with CPL measures yielding moderate classification accuracy (AUC = 0.70-0.73). In contrast to high-gamma findings, the alpha band showed increased integration (shorter CPL) within the DMN and between the VAN and DAN in the ADHD group, alongside differences in alpha and beta band node properties in cingulate and somatomotor regions. Our findings reveal robust, frequency-dependent functional network alterations in adult ADHD, particularly highlighting disrupted high-frequency communication within and between key cognitive networks.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

A.; Krall, R. F.; Lam, S.; Arnold, M. P.; Williamson, R.

We used a combination of in vitro slice electrophysiology, optogenetics, and in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate layer 5 extratelencephalic (ET) and layer 6 corticothalamic (CT) neuronal plasticity in mice, following noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Thalamocortical (TC) input was initially balanced between CTs and ETs but shifted to CT-dominant one day post-NIHL and then normalized by day seven. This transient shift was accompanied by increased quantal size and suprathreshold excitability in CTs, with minimal changes in ETs. In vivo, CTs exhibited persistent elevation in sound intensity thresholds, while ETs showed a transient shift in frequency tuning and reduced high-frequency responsiveness that recovered within a week. These findings reveal distinct, cell-type-specific plasticity mechanisms in deep-layer ACtx neurons following peripheral damage and highlight potential targets for treating hearing loss-related disorders such as tinnitus and hyperacusis.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Chimeric Immunoglobulin and human Immunoglobulin M structures provide insights on joining-chain independent assembly and function", "doi": "10.1101/2025.07.09.663956", "authors": "Lyu, M.; Stadtmueller, B. M.", "abstract": "Polymeric (p) immunoglobulins (Igs) play critical roles in vertebrate immunity. IgM is the evolutionarily oldest pIg and functions both in circulation and in the mucosa. pIgM typically comprises between four and six IgM monomers and up to one joining chain (JC), which in mammals facilitates pIg assembly and promotes delivery to mucosal secretions. Bony fish (teleosts) lack JC and assemble tetrameric IgM whereas humans can express JC-containing pentamers and JC-free hexamers. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of two JC-free chimeric IgM, comprising bony fish and human sequences, and the structure of human hexameric IgM. Chimeric IgM structures adopted unique pentameric geometry distinct from both human and fish pIgM whereas the human hexameric IgM structure adopted hexagonal geometry similar to JC-containing pentameric IgM, albeit with structural differences in center of the molecule. Together results provide new insights on how IgM heavy chain motifs contribute to JC-free pIgM assembly and reveal plasticity of this process, which can be manipulated to create pIg structures not observed in nature. Moreover, we found that antigen-targeting chimeric IgM could neutralize C. difficile toxin cytotoxicity, indicating potential to engineer uniquely structured pIgs to prevent or treat disease.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "Neutrophils are short-lived cells that are produced by the billions every day to circulate throughout the body and surveil all tissues. They are a key component of the innate immune system that play essential roles in antimicrobial immunity, but can also instigate sterile inflammatory diseases like gout and cancer. Immunometabolic paradigms that were developed by studying T cells and macrophages establish that cellular metabolic programming dictates immune function. Neutrophils have long been known as glucose-reliant and highly glycolytic. But surprising neutrophil heterogeneity has recently been described, and roles for lipids have been reported in both granulopoiesis and mature neutrophil effector function. Therefore, we set out to uncover how neutrophils acquire lipids from their environment and how this influences their functionality in the context of lipotoxicity. We found that neutrophils take up both free fatty acids and complex lipoproteins, but that their uptake is regulated through different signaling pathways. Neutrophil lipoprotein uptake is inducible by certain TLR2 signals, and this causes neutrophils to depolymerize their actin fibers and stop moving. Using a mouse model of atherosclerosis, we show that neutrophils in the plaque are lipid-laden and that neutrophil-deficient mice are protected from atherosclerotic plaque growth. Lipoprotein uptake causes neutrophils to recruit macrophages, conditional ablation of TLR2 on neutrophils prevents their lipid uptake and storage, and these mice are also protected against atherosclerosis. Our work highlights an important understudied role for lipids in neutrophil biology, and the importance of studying different lipid classes and different signaling pathways in neutrophils as compared to other myeloid populations.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping generally relies on sexual recombination to break linkages between genes, yet bacteria rarely undergo sufficient homologous recombination to generate suitable mapping populations. In this work, we used iterative biparental genome shuffling by protoplast fusion in Bacillus subtilis to generate a population of bacteria with substantial random recombination throughout their genomes. Individual shuffled progeny were arrayed in well plates, resequenced, and characterized for a range of complex phenotypes including spore germination and swarming motility. Genetic mapping of the resulting phenotypes identified high-confidence QTLs of moderate size (~10 kb), and these associations were validated through targeted genetic swaps. This B. subtilis QTL population can easily be used to map additional phenotypes and the general approach for QTL mapping is applicable in a wide range of bacteria.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

L.; Robello, C.; Berna, L.; Cricco, J. A.", "abstract": "Heme is an essential molecule for most organisms, yet some parasites, like Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, cannot synthesize it. These parasites must acquire heme from their hosts, making this process critical for their survival. In the midgut of the insect vector, T. cruzi epimastigotes are exposed to both hemoglobin (Hb) and free heme resulting from its degradation. Despite the importance of this nutrient, how different heme sources influence parasite gene expression remains poorly understood. Here, we showed that heme restitution either as hemin or Hb to heme-starved parasites induces an early and distinct transcriptional response in T. cruzi epimastigotes. Using RNA sequencing at 4- and 24-hours post-supplementation, we identified gene subsets commonly or uniquely regulated by each heme source, including genes putatively linked to heme acquisition and metabolism. We also presented here the first studies focused on CRAL/TRIO domain-containing protein (TcCRAL/TRIO), a novel heme responsive hemoprotein identified from this study. Our results provide a more detailed picture of T. cruzi biology and highlights heme acquisition as a promising point of vulnerability. These findings may ultimately contribute to the identification of potential molecular targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies against Chagas disease.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Breast Cancer Susceptibility Gene 1 (BRCA1) codes for a DNA repair protein that facilitates the repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in human cells through the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Mutations of BRCA1 are highly associated with breast cancer; however, many variants remain unclassified with unknown cellular phenotypes. The DNA binding activity of BRCA1 is localized primarily to its central region, which can be divided into two distinct domains: DNA Binding Domain 1 (DBD1; amino acids (aa) 330-554) and 2 (DBD2; aa 894-1057). We previously proposed a model in which DBD1 targets BRCA1 to DSBs for the promotion of DNA end resection, while DBD2 targets BRCA1 to telomeres to function in chromatin remodeling and telomere regulation. In this study, we hypothesized that unknown DBD variants (T374I, K408E, N417S, N909I, M1008I, and R1028H) with similar properties to known disease-causing variants (Q356H, F461L, R496H, D940Y, S1027N, and E1038G) would also be pathogenic. The affinities of each variant for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and a G-quadruplex (G4) sequence were measured via biolayer interferometry. The DNA repair phenotypes of each variant were analyzed by overexpression in HEK cells to determine correlation between binding activity and DNA damage response. Altogether, these results provide insight into how missense mutations affect the ability of BRCA1 DBDs to facilitate the DNA damage response.", "date": "2025-07-14", "journal": ""}
