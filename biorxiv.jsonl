L.; Jacoby, N.", "abstract": "Pitch perception is central for both speech and music, and the representation of musical pitch has intrigued scholars for centuries. In his seminal work, Roger Shepard proposed a series of increasingly complex geometrical models to approximate the psychological representation of pitch, most famously the pitch helix which is often used in textbooks. The pitch helix represents the logarithmic scaling of the periodicity of tones and the similarity between tones separated by an octave. However, support for geometrical models of musical pitch derives from studies that are small-scale and sometimes contradictory. Moreover, research suggests that the representation of pitch is influenced by task context and expertise raising the question of whether any single integrated geometric approximation is sufficient. Using multi-dimensional scaling analysis, we revisit this problem through nine experiments involving participants with varied levels of musical expertise (N=592) and paradigms covering both perception and production, as well as implicit and explicit measures of perceptual similarity. We show that, depending on task and musical experience, the best geometrical approximation can exhibit an array of structures ranging from linear to double-helical structures, providing strong evidence that a simple helical model, or in fact any fixed geometrical model, cannot explain the data. To explain these large variations, we then show that they can be captured by different reweightings of a small set of perceptual factors suggesting a composite representation. These findings highlight the importance of examining diverse tasks and populations to address the classic question of how perceptual representations are organized.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

Stress-induced changes in pupil and eyelid size/shape have been used as a biomarker in several fMRI studies. However, there were limited knowledges regarding changes in behavior of pupil and eyelid dynamics, particularly on animal models. In the present study, the pupil and eyelid dynamics were carefully investigated and characterized in a newly developed awake rodent fMRI protocol. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the mouse pupil and eyelid diameters were extracted and analyzed during different training and imaging phases in the present project. Our findings demonstrate a consistent downwards trend in pupil and eyelid dynamics under a meticulously designed training protocol, suggesting that the behaviors of the pupil and eyelid can be served as reliable indicators of stress levels and motion artifacts in awake fMRI studies. The current recording platform not only enables the facilitation of awake animal MRI studies but also highlights its potential applications to numerous other research areas, owing to the non-invasive nature and straightforward implementation.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

V.; Zandawala, M.", "abstract": "Insects have evolved a variety of neurohormones that enable them to maintain their nutrient and osmotic homeostasis. While the identities and functions of various insect metabolic and diuretic hormones have been well-established, the characterization of an anti-diuretic signaling system that is conserved across most insects is still lacking. To address this, here we characterized the ion transport peptide (ITP) signaling system in Drosophila. The Drosophila ITP gene encodes five transcript variants which generate three different peptide isoforms: ITP amidated (ITPa) and two ITP-like (ITPL1 and ITPL2) isoforms. Using a combination of anatomical mapping and single-cell transcriptome analyses, we comprehensively characterized the expression of all three ITP isoforms in the nervous system and peripheral tissues. Our analyses reveal widespread expression of ITP isoforms. Moreover, we show that ITPa-producing neurons are activated and release ITPa during dehydration. Further, recombinant Drosophila ITPa inhibits diuretic peptide-induced renal tubule secretion ex vivo, thus confirming its role as an anti-diuretic hormone. Using a phylogenetic-driven approach, an ex vivo secretion assay and a heterologous mammalian cell-based assay, we identified and functionally characterized Gyc76C, a membrane guanylate cyclase, as a bona fide Drosophila ITPa receptor. Thus, recombinant ITPa application leads to increased cGMP production in HEK293T cells expressing Drosophila Gyc76C. Moreover, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules abolishes the inhibitory effect of ITPa on diuretic hormone stimulated secretion. Extensive anatomical mapping of Gyc76C reveals that it is highly expressed in larval and adult tissues associated with osmoregulation (renal tubules and rectum) and metabolic homeostasis (fat body). Consistent with this expression, knockdown of Gyc76C in renal tubules impacts tolerance to osmotic and ionic stresses, whereas knockdown specifically in the fat body impacts feeding, nutrient homeostasis and associated behaviors. We also complement receptor knockdown experiments with ITP knockdown and ITPa overexpression in ITPa-producing neurons. Interestingly, the ITPa-Gyc76C pathway examined here is reminiscent of the atrial natriuretic peptide signaling in mammals. Lastly, we utilized connectomics and single-cell transcriptomics to identify synaptic and paracrine pathways upstream and downstream of ITPa-expressing neurons. Our analysis identifies pathways via which ITP neurons integrate hygrosensory inputs and interact with other homeostatic hormonal pathways. Taken together, our systematic characterization of ITP signaling establishes a tractable system to decipher how a small set of neurons integrates diverse inputs to orchestrate systemic homeostasis in Drosophila.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

In adult mice, osteolineage PDPN-positive cells are associated with femoral microarchitecture. However, specific roles of PDPN in fetal bone development remain unclear. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics and physiological functions of PDPN-positive cells during fetal femur development. In the fetal femur, PDPN-positive cells first emerged in the primitive cortical bone, termed the bone collar, concurrently with primary ossification center initiation. Several PDPN-positive cells in the bone collar migrated to the marrow cavity and populated the metaphyseal trabecular bone. Most PDPN-positive cells in both the bone collar and trabeculae exhibited osteolineage features, such as osterix expression. Pdpn knockout fetuses exhibited abnormal recruitment of osterix-positive cells and mineral deposition in the dorsal bone collar.

Here, we present a scalable, genome-resolved framework that integrates population-specific metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) to discover novel species, strain diversity, and disease associations. From 1,878 deeply sequenced samples in the Estonian microbiome cohort (EstMB-deep), we reconstructed 84,762 MAGs representing 2,257 species, including 353 (15.6%) previously uncharacterized species reaching up to 30% relative abundances in some individuals. We integrated these MAGs with the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection to create an expanded reference (GUTrep), enabling profiling of 2,509 EstMB individuals and testing associations with 33 prevalent diseases. Of 25 diseases with significant associations, 8 involved newly identified species, underscoring the value of population-specific MAGs. To quantify within-species diversity, we developed the Strain Richness Index (SRI), a novel MAG-based metric that informed strain-level analyses. Based on SRI, we prioritized Odoribacter splanchnicus, a prevalent species with the lowest strain heterogeneity, yielding sufficient power for strain-level analysis. We identified two dominant strains, N1 and N2, with distinct gene repertoires and divergent disease associations. Notably, strain N1 was negatively associated with gastritis and duodenitis and hypertensive heart disease, associations undetected at the species level. Our study expands the human gut reference landscape, demonstrates the importance of population-specific MAGs for uncovering novel microbial diversity, and reveals strain-level disease associations obscured at higher taxonomic levels, highlighting the need for genome-resolved approaches in microbiome research.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

S.; Garay, J.", "abstract": "Microbial symbiosis is extremely common among metabolically coupled cells, and, presumably, gave rise to mitochondria. How such symbioses emerge, evolve and stabilize are unknown, especially in the prokaryotic domain, where endosymbioses are virtually nonexistent. Yet there is growing evidence suggesting that the eukaryotic cell emerged from such a prokaryotic partnership, where integration was not the result of phagocytotic inclusion (as in case of plastids) but of metabolic cooperation. While prokaryotes almost ubiquitously engage in metabolic syntrophy, it is unknown if such cooperation alone can enable stable, dependent ectosymbioses that could pave the road toward physical integration of parties. Here, we tested the hypothesis that free-living syntrophy can lead to stable ectosymbiosis between microbial partners, using an ecological mathematical model. Assuming an already syntrophic and asymmetric partnership of free-living hosts and symbionts, we investigated under what conditions obligate ectosymbiosis evolve. Our results show that reduced inhibition (of self-inhibiting metabolic products) over the contact surface of partners can stabilize the ectosymbiotic consortia against free-living forms. Furthermore, strong metabolic activity between the host and their ectosymbionts could facilitate obligacy in their physical association. The model points to the significance of the contact surface in the evolution of crucial endosymbiotic features. Our results support the hypothesis that cooperative, syntrophic microbes (especially prokaryotes) are capable of coevolving to form species-specific ectosymbiosis by means of reducing the inhibition of accumulating products, a necessary first step towards endosymbiotic integration. The model provides a plausible explanation on how common metabolic syntrophy can lead to physical integration of parties through gradual ectosymbiosis. Moreover, our work fills a gap between microbial cooperation models (assuming free-living species) and those that are concerned only with already concluded physical integration under a multilevel selection paradigm.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

We studied a 70-year nutrient-deficiency experiment in a managed grassland in central Austria, where aboveground biomass was harvested three times annually. N, P and K were fully, partially, or not replenished, causing long-term nutrient deficiencies and imbalances. We analysed AMF communities in soil and roots by DNA/RNA amplicon sequencing and fatty-acid biomarkers, alongside soil and plant community properties. Soil AMF communities were affected by N and P deficiencies, while root AMF communities were most susceptible to K deficiency, showing a 50% biomass reduction. We observed distinct guild- and family-specific responses: The edaphophilic guild declined with N deficiency, while the rhizophilic guild decreased with P and K deficiencies. Families within each guild, particularly in the ancestral guild, showed differential responses, indicating complementary nutrient specializations at the family level. Our findings underscore the previously unrecognized role of K deficiency in AMF symbiosis and suggest the existence of nutrient-related functional subgroups within exploration-based AMF guilds.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

C.; Cavanah, P. J.", "abstract": "Selective attention is the collection of mechanisms through which the brain preferentially processes behaviorally important information. Many everyday tasks, such as shopping for groceries, require selective sampling (i.e., attention-related sampling) of both external information (i.e., information from the environment) and internally stored information (i.e., information being maintained in working memory). While there is clear evidence that selective sampling of external information is influenced by internally stored information (and vice versa), the extent to which selective sampling of external and internal information share neural resources remains a focus of debate. Previous research has linked theta-rhythmic (3-8 Hz) neural activity in higher-order (e.g., frontal cortices) and sensory regions to theta-rhythmic changes in behavioral performance during selective sampling. Here, we used EEG and a dual-task design (i.e., a task that required both external and internal information), in male and female humans, to directly compare theta-dependent fluctuations in behavioral performance during external sampling with those during internal sampling. Our findings are consistent with a shared theta-rhythmic process for selectively sampling external information or internal information. This theta-rhythmic sampling is associated with both phase-dependent changes in sensory responses (i.e., as measured with the N1 component) and phase-dependent changes in interactions between external and internal information. The theta phase associated with weaker sensory responses and relatively worse behavioral performance (i.e., the bad phase) is also associated with a slowed perceptual decision-making process (as measured with the CPP component), specifically during dual-task trials when to-be-detected external information matches to-be-remembered internal information.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

We previously demonstrated that the overexpression of PA200 in NSCLC is associated with immune evasion and reduced responsiveness to immune checkpoint inhibitors. The cell autonomous function of PA200 in cancer growth, however, is not solved. We here demonstrate that deletion of PA200 in two distinct lung cancer cell lines induced cell-specific alterations in proteasome composition and activities with a minor direct impact on overall proteasome activity. Deficiency of PA200 in lung cancer cells did not consistently alter tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. However, we observed concerted inhibition of tumor cell migration and invasion with conserved downregulation of the integrin ITGB3 and transcriptional dysregulation of multiple cell adhesion and ECM regulators. Our transcriptome profiling revealed a striking disparity in the transcriptional response to PA200 deletion in the two lung cancer cell lines. Together with our PA200 interactome analysis that uncovered an unexpected cell-dependent profile of PA200-interacting proteins, our data indicate that the function of PA200 is cell-specific and depends on the cellular context. In conclusion, we here demonstrate that PA200 cell-autonomously regulates the invasive capacities of tumor cells thereby potentially promoting lung cancer spread and metastasis formation. This mechanism might add to PA200-related immune evasion and may contribute to the observed poor prognosis of PA200-overexpressing lung cancer patients.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

Although the corticospinal tract is critical for gait and postural control, its response to such instabilities remains unclear. To investigate if corticospinal excitability increases during laterally destabilised gait, single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulations were delivered over the primary motor cortex of 15 healthy individuals during steady-state and laterally destabilised treadmill gait. Full-body kinematics were recorded using an optoelectronic motion capture system. Stimulations with coil displacement >5 mm from the targeted location were excluded. Corticospinal excitability was quantified for four upper- and three lower-leg muscles by the motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and compared between steady-state and destabilised gait. Destabilisation resulted in a wider step width and shorter stride duration with increased variability and greater dynamic instability. Foot placement control was increased at mid-swing, along with greater average foot placement error. No differences in corticospinal excitability were observed in the lower-leg muscles. All upper-leg muscles demonstrated greater absolute MEPs in destabilised relative to steady-state gait. After normalising MEP to the pre-stimulus muscle activity, these periods became less pronounced, however, increases were observed in all but the gastrocnemius muscles. These findings suggest heightened readiness of the corticospinal tract projecting to upper-leg muscles during destabilised gait, which could reflect general stabilising strategies such as decreasing stride time and increasing step width.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

We addressed this question by implementing a mathematical model of the OB input-output transformation in which the output of each glomerulus is a function of its ORN input, local and lateral inhibition. The model produced outputs with concentration-response relationships that depended on the input ORN Hill coefficient and half-activation value. Some glomeruli responded with monotonic increases or decreases, while others responded with non-monotonic decreases then increases or increased then decreased. The model yielded several novel predictions that challenged recent findings in the field, including the existence of an abundance of non-monotonic responses and that inhibition across the interglomerular network should increase with excitation. We tested these predictions using single and dual-color in vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging from ORN and MTC glomeruli in awake mice. MTC glomeruli responded to odors with monotonic and non-monotonic concentration-response relationships in an odor-specific manner. Notably the mean excitation and suppression across the glomerular population were significantly correlated with one another and half of the MTC glomeruli exhibited some degree of non-monotonicity. The magnitude of non-monotonicity in MTC glomeruli was significantly correlated with the affinity of its ORN input and decreasing MTC glomeruli were innervated by low affinity or non-responsive ORN input.

We explore this possibility in carnivorous Caryophyllales, a morphologically and chromosomally diverse plant lineage encompassing sundews, Venus flytraps, and Nepenthes pitcher plants. Focusing on sundews (Drosera), we generated chromosome-scale assemblies of holocentric D. regia and monocentric D. capensis, which share an allohexaploid origin but have diverged dramatically in genome structure. D. regia retains ancestral chromosomal fusions, dispersed centromeric repeats, and conserved synteny, whereas D. capensis exhibits extensive chromosomal reorganization and regionally localized centromeres after a lineage-specific genome duplication. Phylogenomic evidence traces D. regia to an ancient hybridization between sundew- and Venus flytrap-like ancestors, setting it apart within its infrageneric context.

Here, we have processed the cecum from 232 mice from our recent aging colony across age (6-24 months), diet (chow or high fat), and genetics (43 BXD strains) and sequenced their metagenome, metatranscriptome, and cecal transcriptome. We quantify changes in over 300 species caused by interactions between diet, age, and genetic background. Traditional bioinformatics approaches linked particular microbes to observed phenotypes, while newer machine learning models based microbial clusters accurately predicted host outcomes, including individual body weight (AUC = 0.92) and chronological age (AUC = 0.84). This was further enhanced by a compact 10-feature multi-omics model, combining our microbiome data with prior liver expression data to increase chronological age AUC to 0.95. Mechanistically, integrative network analyses identified dozens of significant links between particular bacterial taxa and gene expression, such as a strong negative correlation between host Ido1 expression and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing Lachnospiraceae, indicating dietary fat can modulate host tryptophan metabolism via microbiota shifts. Moreover, as our study uses inbred mice sampled across time, we have identified signature sets of taxonomies that provide excellent predictive value for future metabolic outcomes driven by metabolic networks connecting the microbiome to the host organism's tissues (here, cecum and liver from the same mice). By better understanding the gut-liver axis, we can understand the cellular etiologies of metabolic disease and identify earlier, personalized diagnostic biomarkers attuned to the genetic background and environmental state of the individual.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

The Drosophila melanogaster Cyclin G gene (CycG) encodes a transcriptional cyclin that regulates growth and the cell cycle. Over-expression of a potentially more stable isoform of the protein (deleted of a PEST-rich domain, hereafter called CycG{Delta}P) induces extreme wing size and shape FA (i.e. high developmental noise), indicating a major disruption of developmental stability. Previous attempts to identify the genetic bases of FA have been impeded by the constitutively low level of developmental noise, strongly limiting the power to detect any effect. Here, we leverage the extreme developmental instability induced by overexpression of CycG{Delta}P to explore the genetic bases of FA: we perform a genome-wide screen for deficiencies that enhance or reduce CycG{Delta}P-induced wing FA. 499 deficiencies uncovering 90% of the euchromatic genome were combined with a recombinant chromosome expressing CycG{Delta}P. We identified 13 and 16 deficiencies that enhance and decrease FA, respectively. Analysis of mutants for some genes located in these deficiencies shows that Cyclin G ensures homogeneous growth of organs in synergy with the major morphogens of the wing, Dpp and Wg, as well as the Hippo and InR/TOR pathways. They also reveal that CycG{Delta}P-induced FA involves Larp, a potential direct interactor of Cyclin G, that regulates translation at the mitochondrial membrane. This opens up new research perspectives for understanding developmental stability, suggesting a significant role for mitochondrial activity.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce a novel algorithm to integrate independently recorded sessions into \"super-sessions\", validated using ground-truth synthetic data, enabling the reconstruction of simultaneous multi-area recordings aligned to matched gaze sequences. Applying Dynamic Bayesian Network analysis to these super-sessions, we uncover temporally structured, behavior-dependent causal interactions among the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and anterior cingulate cortex. When macaques were the targets of social gaze, the brain-behavior network exhibited positive temporal modulations, with the dmPFC emerging as the dominant source and the amygdala as a primary recipient of influence. When macaques directed their gaze toward their partners, the dmPFC and amygdala retained their respective roles. Prefrontal regions positively modulated one another, while the amygdala acted solely as a downstream target receiving exclusively negatively modulated prefrontal inputs. These findings reveal previously unknown directional interactions in the primate social brain and highlight distinct causal architectures underlying the bidirectional dynamics of social attention.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

The mode of cell communication used influences the signalling range. In many developing epithelia, contact-based Notch-Delta lateral inhibition signalling is used to pattern cell fates. While previous work revealed that cells can use protrusions to extend the range of Notch-Delta signalling to alter these patterns, this is not a general feature of epithelia. In addition, it is not known how the complex three-dimensional (3D) shapes of epithelial cells influence cell communication. In exploring this question, we show that epithelial cells at the Drosophila wing margin, which lack basal protrusions, contact different neighbours at different heights along their apico-basal axis, effectively increasing the number of neighbours each cell touches. To quantitatively assess this behaviour, we develop a novel mathematical modelling framework (Multi-layer Signalling Model) to simulate Notch-Delta signalling over data-derived 3D cell topologies. The model predicts that lateral cell surface signalling is essential to tune the spacing between SOPs. In agreement, we show that perturbing cortical stiffness and cell tortuosity in vivo modifies SOP spacing.

Changes in gene regulation make important contributions to this process. However, the degree to which admixture shapes gene regulatory variation in hybrid populations remains poorly understood. Here, we combine genome-wide resequencing and DNA methylation data from 295 hybrid baboons - members of a single, intensively studied natural population - to investigate how admixture affects the genetic architecture of this important epigenetic mark. Results: We find that local genetic ancestry frequently predicts DNA methylation levels and recapitulates differences between the parent species. By performing methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) mapping, we show that these differences predominantly arise due to evolved differences in allele frequencies. Thus, admixture in the hybrid population increases variance in DNA methylation, including by introducing meQTL that would otherwise be invariant. Finally, we integrate massively parallel reporter assay data to show that admixture-derived variation in DNA methylation alters enhancer activity and gene expression. Conclusions: Together, these results demonstrate how admixture can meaningfully alter the genetic architecture of gene regulatory traits in natural hybrid zones. They also suggest that the genetic architecture of DNA methylation is conserved across closely related primates, suggesting that genetic effects on gene regulation may remain stable over timescales that range into the millions of years.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

Using high-density EEG, we mapped gamma and alpha responses across a broad set of retinotopic, orientation, and motion conditions. Gamma was strongly retinotopically tuned, with linear summation of subfield responses accurately predicting full-field responses. In contrast, alpha showed little spatial tuning, substantial responses even in the absence of visual input (anticipatory suppression), and subadditive summation consistent with divisive normalization. Across most retinotopic configurations, higher gamma coincided with stronger alpha suppression, yet systematic dissociations emerged, with full-field and foveal-centered gratings evoking stronger than expected gamma relative to alpha suppression. Orientation tuning was robust for gamma but weak for alpha, with oblique gratings producing high gamma yet weak alpha suppression, reversing the usual inverse relationship. These patterns indicate that EEG gamma power primarily reflects large-scale synchronous activity that matches the global LFP observed in macaque V1, whose spatial and feature tuning properties are independent of both single-neuron selectivity and feedback-driven alpha dynamics.

This gap stems from the limitations of widely used single-cell RNA-sequencing protocols, which focus on polyadenylated transcripts and miss many short or non-polyadenylated RNAs. Here, we adapted single-cell RNA-sequencing on the 10x Genomics platform to capture a broad complement of coding and non-coding RNAs - including miRNAs, tRNAs, lncRNAs, histone RNAs, and non-adenylated viral transcripts. This approach enabled the discovery of rich, dynamic non-coding RNA programs across immune cells, virally infected hepatocytes, and the developing human brain. In dengue virus-infected hepatocytes, we detect non-adenylated viral transcripts and distinguish active from transcriptionally quiescent infected states, each with distinct host regulatory signatures. In brain tissue, we identify biotype-specific, cell-type-restricted non-coding RNAs, including miRNAs whose expression anticorrelates with predicted targets, consistent with post-transcriptional regulatory relationships. We show that MIR137, one of the strongest GWAS loci associated with schizophrenia and intellectual disability, is expressed specifically in Cajal-Retzius cells, an early-born but transient population that guides subsequent cortical neuron migration.

The YAP/TAZ transcriptional regulators are universal effectors of physical signals. Yet, the identity of proteins and subcellular structures serving as mechano-rheostats remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that perinuclear centrosome and microtubules' architecture act functionally downstream of F-actin as cornerstones of cellular mechanotransduction. The mechanism revolves around the stability of AMOT proteins, that act as cytoplasmic inhibitory sinks for YAP/TAZ. Being degraded in mechano-activated cells and stabilized in mechanically-inhibited cells, AMOT serves as primary mechanical rheostat. In mechanically inhibited cells, microtubules form a cage-like network surrounding the nucleus, but, in mechanically activated cells, switch their architecture with formation of the centrosome from which microtubules sprout toward the cell periphery. In these conditions, AMOT proteins bound to the Dynein/Dynactin complex are subject to fast retrograde transport through the microtubular aster toward the pericentrosomal proteasome for quantitative and timely degradation. Restoring centrosomal condensation in mechanically inhibited cells by NLP1 overexpression is sufficient to restore mechanosignaling and YAP activation. AMOT proteins serves as universal integrator of distinct physical inputs from the ECM and the cytoskeleton, and their ablation renders cells invariably mechano-insensitive. Our findings also provide a unifying model that mechanistically merges mechanosignaling with the Hippo cascade. The current model by which YAP/TAZ are regulated by Hippo kinases is through direct YAP/TAZ phosphorylation. Our data instead show that, at least in the context of mechanotransduction, Hippo signaling inhibits YAP/TAZ largely indirectly, through LATS phosphorylation of AMOT averting it from its degradation route. We further show that Ras/RTK oncogenes hijack the AMOT degradation route to promote YAP/TAZmediated tumorigenesis. The findings imply the AMOT stabilization machinery as novel target for YAP/TAZ therapeutic modulation.

In this study, we theoretically identify the evolutionary pressures that may have driven this divergence in genome size. We use a parameter-free model to study genome size evolution under selection pressure to minimize replication time and maximize information storage capacity. We substantiate this choice by demonstrating a correlation between replication time and genome size using literature data. We show that bacteria tend to reduce genome size, constrained by a single replication origin, while eukaryotes expand their genomes by incorporating multiple replication origins. We propose a connection between genome size and cellular energetics, suggesting that endosymbiotic organelles, mitochondria and chloroplasts, evolutionarily regulate the number of replication origins, thereby influencing genome size in eukaryotes. We substantiate this claim by showing a correlation between organelle count and genome size data. We argue that nucleotide skews, present in nearly all genomes studied, and are used to identify replication origins, directly influence DNA unzipping kinetics, and hence its replication time. This connection enables us to derive nearly universal observations, such as Chargaff's second parity rule and replichore symmetrization, as adaptive consequences. We argue that high skews lead to faster replication, and substantiate it by showing a correlation between skews and replication speed in bacteria. The model reproduces more evolutionary genomic observations, such as a general preference for deletions over insertions across domains, and elongation and high variance of genome size under reduced selection pressure for replication rate, an integral component of C-value paradox.

While these deep learning (DL) models excel at predicting well-ordered regions, accurate prediction of loop regions, which often are flexible and crucial for protein function, remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the Equivariant Loop Evaluation Network (ELEN), a local model quality assessment (MQA) method that is tailored towards evaluating the accuracy of protein loops at the per-residue level. ELEN jointly predicts three quality metrics, local Distance Difference Test (lDDT), Contact Area Difference Score (CAD-score), and Root Mean Squared Deviation (RMSD), by comparing predicted to experimental reference structures. Learning these metrics simultaneously enables ELEN to capture complementary structural insights, providing a richer assessment of model accuracy. The network operates at all-atom resolution and employs 3D equivariant group convolutions to learn the local geometric environment of each atom. By incorporating sequence embeddings from large language models (LLMs), such as SaProt, we enhance the sequence and evolutionary awareness of the model. Furthermore, by informing ELEN with per-residue physicochemical features, the model achieves competitive accuracy relative to state-of-the-art MQA methods on the Continuous Automated Model EvaluatiOn (CAMEO) benchmark. Although ELEN was primarily developed for assessing loop quality, its architecture also demonstrates strong potential for general MQA tasks. We used ELEN to perform detailed analysis, including identification of flexible or disordered regions and assessment of structural effects from single-residue mutations on three sets of redesigned enzymes.

The resulting RNA ESM (RESM) outperforms 12 existing RNA language models in zero-shot prediction, not only in sequence classification but also in RNA secondary structure and RNA-RNA interaction prediction. Further supervised fine-tuning demonstrates RESM's generalizability and superior performance over the existing models compared across multiple downstream tasks, including mRNA ribosome loading efficiency and gene expression prediction, despite RESM being trained exclusively on noncoding RNAs. Moreover, RESM can generalize to unseen sequences beyond its 1,024-nucleotide training limit, achieving 81.3% improvement over state-of-the-art methods in supervised secondary structure prediction for RNAs up to 4,000 nucleotides, limited only by the available GPU memory, while providing >1000-fold speedup compared to MSA-based approaches. RESM provides a robust foundation for deciphering RNA sequence-structure-function relationships, with broad implications for RNA biology.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "The unicellular malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum proliferates within the red blood cells of its human host, where it generates approximately 20 new parasites within an infection cycle of two days. Proliferation proceeds by nuclear divisions in a shared cytoplasm, followed by cellularization. In stark contrast to the highly synchronized nuclear division cycles in many eukaryotes, Plasmodium nuclear cycles desynchronize rapidly. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of desynchronization and study its impact on parasite fitness by combining live-cell imaging of DNA replication with biophysical modeling. We find that the standard model of independent nuclear cycles with transgenerational inheritance cannot account for the experimental data, and therefore desynchronization requires nuclear coupling. Competition for a limiting pool of a replication resource explains the data, provided that the resource is allocated sequentially to individual nuclei. Sequential allocation can be achieved by stable but reversible loading of a replication component to DNA, for example proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Remarkably, the resultant asynchronous nuclear cycles accelerate parasite proliferation by minimizing idling times of resources. Indeed, we predict theoretically that this mechanism maximizes overall proliferation rate with limited resource availability. Thus, our findings identify nuclear cycle asynchrony as a resource-efficient means to achieve rapid proliferation.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

Despite continuous efforts in understanding its pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms driving EwS metastasis remain poorly understood, thus limiting the potential for therapeutic progress. Here, we identify the tight junction component Coxsackievirus and Adenovirus receptor (CXADR) as a critical regulator of cancer progression and metastasis in EwS. Differential gene expression analysis of patient tumors from two independent cohorts revealed that elevated CXADR levels are associated with metastatic disease and poor overall survival. In functional experiments, conditional CXADR knockdown reduced the growth of EwS cell line models in vitro, and suppressed local tumorigenesis. Notably, CXADR knockdown completely abrogated metastasis formation in vivo. Integration of transcriptome profiling and mechanistic studies uncovered that CXADR promotes the activation of AKT signaling, likely through complex formation with PTEN. Consequently, pharmacological targeting of AKT using the FDA-approved pan-AKT inhibitor Capivasertib showed CXADR-dependent cytotoxicity, with enhanced efficacy if combined with the EwS standard-of-care chemotherapeutic agent Vincristine. Collectively, our findings establish CXADR as a prognostic and predictive biomarker in EwS, highlighting AKT inhibition combined with chemotherapy as a promising strategy for patients with high CXADR expression.

H. P.; Berthon, P.; Leonetti, M.", "abstract": "Background: Myeloid cells play a central role in cancer-associated immunosuppression. Indeed, their accumulation and functional reprogramming attenuate effective immune responses and may facilitate tumor progression. To modulate the activity of the myeloid subsets, we selected to target Fc gamma receptors (FcgRs), since all myeloid cell populations variably express FcgRs. As FcgRIIb provides an inhibitory signaling that might alter efficacy, we developed an immunotherapy, active at a dose low enough to limit binding via this low-affinity receptor while still interacting with higher-affinity FcgRs. We engineered a Fc-based fusion protein whose activity is potentialized by its ability to engage both FcgRs and a coreceptor, Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycan (HSPGs). We specifically designed and fused a HSPG-ligand, named T54, to a human IgG1-Fc molecule to produce the Fc-T54 fusion protein. Methods: Fc-T54 was produced using recombinant technologies. Binding characteristics were assessed using ELISA and flow-cytometric assays while activity was investigated using cell-culture experiments. Ability to affect tumor-growth was investigated using four syngeneic tumor models with low to high immunosuppressive characteristics. Tumor microenvironment (TME) was analysed by flow cytometry. Results: Fc-T54 demonstrates superior binding efficiency to low-affinity FcgRs compared to Fc. It interacts more effectively than Fc with human blood leukocytes, including monocytes, neutrophils, and B lymphocytes, as well as with dendritic cells (DCs) within peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Activation assays show that, relative to Fc, Fc-T54 increases the number of macrophages and B-lymphocytes, decreases neutrophil abundance, and enhances DC activation. Fc-T54 also interacts more efficiently with murine DCs through both FcgRs and its HSPG-binding region. Subcutaneous administration of 20 pmoles of Fc-T54, or a murine Fc-T54 surrogate, significantly reduces tumor growth across three syngeneic tumor models. TME analysis in the MB49 bladder cancer model reveals that this immunotherapy decreases the proportion of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells while increasing CD8+ T-cells and natural killer cells, thereby promoting a microenvironment more prone to tumor control. Conclusions This new FcgR/HSPG-engaging immunotherapy, administered via subcutaneous route, might be relevant to impact the myeloid compartment and thus tumor progression for cancers sensitive as well as resistant to current anti-immune checkpoint immunotherapies.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

Hep-Bmal1KO mice showed faster MASH progression with increased hepatic cholesterol, inflammation, and fibrosis. Transcriptomic and lipidomic analyses revealed dysregulated cholesterol metabolism in Hep-Bmal1KO mice, marked by reduced expression and disrupted rhythmicity of key cholesterol-related genes. Bioinformatic analyses identified Chrebp as a potential co-regulator of these transcriptional changes. In an in vitro model with palmitate exposure and gene silencing, we found that Bmal1, but not Chrebp, regulated cholesterol accumulation, indicating a Bmal1-specific role in hepatic cholesterol metabolism. Translating our findings to a human patient cohort revealed a significantly shifted circadian phase, despite no marked effect on hepatic cholesterol levels in the livers of patients with more advanced liver disease (i.e., MASH) compared to simple steatosis.

K.; Keane, J.; Leisching, G.", "abstract": "Background Sex differences in immune responses are well-documented, with females exhibiting more robust immunity against infections but higher susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, while males often demonstrate more severe inflammatory pathology. Neutrophils which are key players in the innate immune response, display sex-based functional differences, but whether these extend to metabolic programming, particularly in low-density neutrophils (LDNs), remains unknown. Methods We isolated LDNs and normal-density neutrophils (NDNs) from healthy human donors using density gradient centrifugation and negative selection. Cellular metabolism was assessed via Seahorse XF analysis (measuring oxygen consumption rate, OCR, and extracellular acidification rate, ECAR), alongside flow cytometry for maturity markers (CD16hi/lo). Results Male LDNs exhibited significantly higher basal OCR and ATP production than female LDNs, while no sex differences were observed in NDNs. Strikingly, male LDNs had higher OCR and glycolysis than their matched NDNs, whereas female NDNs were more oxidative than their LDNs. These metabolic differences were independent of neutrophil maturity, as CD16hi frequencies did not differ between subsets or sexes. Conclusions Our study reveals, for the first time, subset-specific sexual dimorphism in neutrophil metabolism whereby male LDNs adopt a hypermetabolic (oxidative/glycolytic) phenotype, while female NDNs retain higher oxidative capacity. This reprogramming occurs independently of developmental stage, suggesting sex hormones or epigenetic regulation may drive these differences. These findings provide a metabolic basis for sex-biased immune responses and highlight the need for sex-stratified approaches in neutrophil-targeted therapies.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

In contrast, recalcitrant substrates like cellulose are thought to support higher diversity through slower growth and increased niche partitioning. In previous work, we showed that compost-derived microbial communities propagated on cellulose maintained high diversity over nearly a year. To determine whether such diversity is specific to recalcitrant substrates or reflects more general features of assembly, we tracked community dynamics in three environments - cellulose paper, cellulose broth, and glucose - using daily 16S rRNA profiling over eight weeks. Communities were maintained through bi-weekly serial transfers, with five replicates per treatment, yielding a high-resolution dataset of over 800 samples. Despite originating from the same inoculum, communities diverged sharply in both taxonomic and functional composition. Cellulose environments yielded stable communities enriched in specialists, while glucose environments exhibited rapid succession and dominance by generalists. Surprisingly, all environments sustained comparably high levels of taxonomic diversity. Functional inference suggested extensive cross-feeding and resource salvaging in both cases. While the mechanisms maintaining diversity on glucose remain unresolved, our results reveal distinct assembly trajectories under simple carbon regimes and provide a foundation for future mechanistic study.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

Inversion studies in wild populations usually target rare cases of major trait polymorphisms or local adaptation whose genetic basis involves inversions, creating a strong impression that inversions in nature are generally maintained by natural selection through links to ecologically relevant phenotypes. By contrast, genome-wide studies in humans and model organisms suggest that inversion polymorphisms are common, subject to highly complex evolutionary processes, and generally difficult to link with clearly observable cases of phenotypic variation. Using a large comparative population genomic dataset generated from 35 codistributed species of birds, we tested the hypothesis that inversions are common even within populations that lack known phenotypic polymorphisms. We leveraged analytical methods suitable for low-coverage whole genome sequencing to reveal evidence for over 170 putative inversion polymorphisms within 28 species. We find that many polymorphisms are large and present at balanced frequencies, and some are shared across species boundaries. Yet, most polymorphisms do not deviate significantly from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, raising the possibility that many of these massive haploblocks could be segregating neutrally. Our results thereby reveal evidence that inversions show a variety of complex yet largely hidden patterns in natural populations, beyond cases where they contribute to known variation in ecologically relevant traits.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

Arthropod silk genes provide an excellent model for studying these processes due to their highly repetitive sequences and rapid evolutionary rates. In Lepidoptera, the Fibroin heavy chain (fibH) gene encodes the primary structural protein for silk fibers, contributing largely to their mechanical strength. This inner fibroin core is surrounded by an outer coating composed primarily of sericins. Sericins are a group of highly repetitive, serine-rich proteins that modulate silk fiber properties. Although sericins in the Domesticated silkworm (Bombyx mori) have been associated with life stage-specific variation in silk characteristics, their evolution and function across Lepidoptera remain poorly understood. Here, we provide a detailed molecular characterization of sericin genes in the Luna moth (Actias luna), a saturniid species known for forming dense, robust, silk-woven cocoons. We identified eight sericin genes that (1) are frequently arranged into clusters of closely related paralogs, (2) exhibit considerable variation in repeat number and amino acid composition, and (3) display distinct gene expression patterns across life stages. A comparison of sericin genes across Saturniidae and Bombycidae reveals evidence for convergent subfunctionalization. These findings suggest that sericin gene duplications enable dynamic shifts in silk composition both within and between species, potentially reflecting adaptive responses to ecological and functional demands.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

We previously reported that the accumulation of 27SA2 rRNA upon the loss of a particular subset of RPL proteins elicits nucleolar reshaping, resulting in the formation of nucleolar rings and vacuoles in C. elegans. Here, we systematically investigated the effects of pre-18S rRNA processing and rRNA transcription on nucleolar structure and reported that defects in these molecular events result in reorganization of the nucleolar architecture. In particular, the depletion of a special subset of small ribosomal subunit proteins (RPSs), namely, class I RPSs, induces a concentric three-layered nucleolar architecture; the inhibition of rRNA transcription induces another three-layered architecture, a sandwich-like nucleoli. Via fluorescence imaging, we found that nucleolar proteins undergo demixing and spatial redistribution into distinct subnucleolar regions during nucleolar structure reorganization. Tracking the subcellular localization of rDNA via a lacI::tagRFP/lacO system revealed that rDNA also redistributed upon nucleolar reorganization. We further identified the Ce.22S rRNA intermediate, which accumulates upon the loss of class I RPSs and regulates the reorganization of the nucleolar structure. Moreover, the conserved nucleolar protein NUCL-1/nucleolin is essential for nucleolar architecture reorganization and regulates the development of nematodes during impaired rRNA production. Together, these findings reveal that the nucleolar structure is orchestrated by the status of rRNA biogenesis and that the accumulation of particular rRNA intermediates can direct the organization of specific nucleolar architectures and the spatial mixing/demixing behavior of the nucleolar proteome.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

C. V.; Weltzin, M. M.", "abstract": "Drug delivery into the brain remains a critical barrier for the treatment of neurological diseases. While the brain is shielded from many toxins and viruses by the blood-brain barrier (BBB), therapeutics are being created that exploit natural bypass mechanisms by forming complexes with cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) derived from viruses. Neurological diseases often impact specific proteins in the brain; however, current CPPs lack the ability to selectively target precise cellular macromolecules. As a result, they are distributed broadly throughout the brain and cause off-target side effects. Neurotropic CPPs derived from the rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) can access the brain by binding to plasma membrane targets, including, but not exclusively, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). To overcome this barrier of minimal target selectivity, we designed several chimeric peptides composed of regions from the RVG and -bungarotoxin, an 7 subtype-selective protein. Using human nAChRs expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, we screened the selectivity of our peptides using two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology. We identified a peptide with improved 7 nAChR subtype selectivity and apparent potency compared to the control RVG peptide. Using mammalian Neuro-2a cells, we demonstrated that our peptide depends on 7 nAChR plasma membrane expression to internalize and carry small-molecule payloads into the neuronal-like cells, without significant cytotoxic effects.

IL4i1 metabolites (indole-3-pyruvate and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate) blocked ferroptosis in all human NB cell lines via a mechanism that depended on free radical scavenging and NRF2 activation but did not require the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.

Recent studies have revealed that monastrol also interacts with fascin, a protein implicated in tumor aggressiveness and metastasis, thereby disrupting microtubule dynamics and actin bundling, ultimately impairing cell migration. In this work, we developed a workflow to identify fascin-binding compounds based on a monastrol-derived pharmacophore model, integrating in silico predictions with in vitro validation. We performed ligand-based virtual screening using a pharmacophore model constructed from monastrol, applied to a high-throughput screening (HTS) library of 1.6 million compounds. The top-ranking candidates from the virtual screening were subsequently subjected to physicochemical characterization and cellular assays. Two compounds (designated Z118298144 and Z17544625) were identified that exhibited strong binding to fascin and inhibited actin bundling in physicochemical assays.

Manufacturers have taken steps to replace toxic long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) with short-chain PFAAs and perfluoroether acids (PFEAs). There is little to no toxicity data for many of these chemicals. Most of the data that are available are taken from studies that do not account for the pH of highly concentrated PFAS solutions, resulting in highly acidic conditions that do not accurately reflect real-world exposures. The goal of this study was to evaluate the lethality and developmental toxicity of 17 structurally diverse PFAS in zebrafish in a pH-neutral environment. We then compared results to determine the impacts of chain length, head group, and ether linkages on toxicity. The potency of PFAS to induce mortality and developmental toxicity endpoints increased with chain length, and sulfonic acids were more potent than carboxylic acids. The inclusion of ether oxygens was associated with reduced potency relative to PFAAs with equal chain length and head group. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was the most potent compound, followed by perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA). Short-chain compounds perfluoro-2-methoxyacetic acid (PFMOAA) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) were the least potent. These data were used to construct a multiple linear regression model for PFAS potency. Failed swim bladder inflation was the most sensitive developmental toxicity endpoint for all assessed chemicals.

Here, we integrate single-cell T cell receptor (TCR) profiling, HLA immunopeptidomics and functional antigen mapping to dissect the specificity landscape of bone marrow lymphocytes (BMLs) in multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We identify a rare subset of tumor-reactive T cells that exhibit a stereotyped transcriptional state distinct from bystander and virus-specific populations. Across both malignancies, immunopeptidomic profiling uncovers a partially conserved antigen repertoire enriched for noncanonical peptides, including products of novel or unannotated open reading frames (nuORFs), pseudogenes, and clonotypic immunoglobulin sequences. Several of these epitopes are recurrently presented and associated with convergent TCR responses across individuals. Based on this immune architecture, we develop a TCR-intrinsic fitness model that infers BML tumor specificity from transcriptional cues and stratifies immunotherapy response across three independent patient cohorts. Together, these findings map the latent potential of endogenous anti-tumor immunity in two biologically distinct diseases and provide a framework for decoding and restoring productive immune surveillance of hematological malignancies.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

Many tadpoles have been reported to exhibit kin recognition based on learned odour cues, potentially linked to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. However, genetic components vary among lineages and local populations, and admixture may further amplify genetic differences among siblings. Here, I compared the kin-biased associations of tadpoles from two local populations: a naturally homogeneous population consisting solely of the Eastern Japanese toad (Bufo japonicus formosus), and an artificially disturbed heterogeneous population containing both Eastern and Western Japanese toads (B. j. japonicus). Genetic analyses revealed higher MHC haplotype diversity in the heterogeneous population. To examine the effects of social experience and aquatic environment on kin discrimination, tadpoles from each population were raised under four rearing conditions (group or solitary, using tap or pond water) and subjected to two binary-choice tests. Results showed that only tadpoles from the heterogeneous population displayed phenotype matching based kin discrimination. However, pond water, with a greater microbial load, disrupted discrimination, indicating that microbiota can obscure odour cues. No kin-bias was detected in the homogeneous population. These findings highlight the interplay among population structure, social experience, and environmental conditions in shaping kin recognition.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

Their elusive behavior and high mobility make monitoring difficult, hindering conservation actions. Passive acoustic monitoring can greatly increase spatial and temporal survey coverage, though the identification of the species' vocalisations within large audio datasets remains challenging. We deployed automated recording units at 108 sites in Tasmania's native forests to collect a large and representative acoustic dataset. We trained a neural network model to automate call detection for both the Tasmanian masked owl and the swift parrot. Our model demonstrated high performance, with a sensitivity of 97.7% and specificity of 96.5% for the Tasmanian masked owl, and a sensitivity of 87.5% and specificity of 83.3% for the swift parrot. Through two real-world applications, we illustrated how our method provides detailed quantitative insights into habitat use patterns over extended spatial and temporal scales. This innovative approach enhances both site-specific and population monitoring, enabling more effective and targeted conservation actions for these endangered species.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

An experimental test using thermally adapted Tribolium castaneum lines", "doi": "10.1101/2025.08.07.669094", "authors": "West, G.; Pointer, M.; Nash, W.; Lewis, R.; Richardson, D. S.", "abstract": "Anthropogenic drivers are restricting many species to small, genetically isolated populations. These are prone to inbreeding depression and are at an increased risk of extinction. Genetic rescue, the controlled introduction of genetic variation from another population, can alleviate inbreeding effects. A major conservation concern, restricting the use of this technique, is that such augmented gene flow may disrupt local adaptation crucial to a populations persistence. Using populations of the red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum) experimentally adapted to reproduce at higher temperatures, we assess whether genetic rescue attempts disrupt thermal adaptation. Rescuers, drawn from populations adapted to either 30{degrees}C or 38{degrees}C, were introduced into populations adapted to 38{degrees}C, which had been inbred for two generations. We recorded population productivity for three generations post-rescue, in the adapted 38{degrees}C environment. Rescuers with and without local adaptation significantly increased the productivity of recipient inbred populations but, importantly, those sharing local adaptation to reproduction at 38{degrees}C provided greater increases in productivity. For the first time, we show that co-adaptation between rescuing individuals and rescuee population maybe an essential aspect of achieving desired conservation outcomes.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the use of prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted nanobubbles (PSMA-NBs) for contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in a rabbit model, aiming to enhance prostate cancer imaging and guide clinical translation. Materials and Methods: PSMA-NBs were formulated using lipid encapsulation and PSMAtargeting ligands. Human PSMA-positive PC3pip-GFP cells were injected into the prostates of immunosuppressed rabbits to establish tumors. Tumor growth was monitored via B-mode ultrasound (US) and MRI. CEUS was conducted with PSMA-NBs and commercial microbubbles (MBs). Time-intensity curve (TIC) analysis, parametric mapping, and post-mortem histological correlation were performed. Results: PSMA-NBs demonstrated 1.60-fold (p = 0.013) and 1.50-fold (p = 0.016) higher peak signal intensities in the tumor core and rim, respectively, compared to MBs, with significantly longer mean transit times (MTTs) in the core (4.20-fold; p = 0.001) and rim (4.50-fold; p < 0.001). At 10 minutes, PSMA-NBs retained detectable signals in tumor rim (7.0 +- 3.0 a.u.), core (3.0 +- 1.0 a.u.), and surrounding tissues (12.0 +- 5.0 a.u.), unlike MBs. Larger tumors showed prolonged MTTs in the rim (3.70 +- 0.50 min) and surrounding tissues (4.60 +- 0.50 min) compared to the core (2.10, +- 0.40 min, p < 0.001). TIC parameters (MTT, AUCwo) correlated with tumor viability, emphasizing PSMA-NBs ability to delineate viable regions. Conclusion: PSMA-NBs significantly enhanced prostate cancer imaging, correlating with tumor viability and outperforming MBs. These findings support their potential to improve diagnostic precision and guide targeted therapy in prostate cancer.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

This study explores the antinociceptive effects of two promising non psychoactive cannabinoids, cannabivarin (CBV) and tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), using Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a nematode model that expresses homologs of mammalian cannabinoid and vanilloid receptors. Thermotaxis assays were employed to quantify the antinociceptive effects of CBV and THCV in C. elegans. Wild type animals were exposed to increasing concentrations of each compound to establish dose-response relationships. To investigate potential molecular targets, additional experiments were performed using mutant strains deficient in vanilloid receptor homologs (OCR-2 and OSM-9) and cannabinoid receptor homologs (NPR-19 and NPR-32). Mass spectrometry-based proteomics combined with network biology analyses were used to identify the biological pathways associated with drug response. Results confirmed that both compounds elicit dose dependent antinociceptive effects. Mutant analyses support the involvement of vanilloid and cannabinoid signaling pathways in mediating these responses. These findings highlight the potential of CBV and THCV as non psychoactive analgesic agents and support further research into their mechanisms of action and translational relevance for mammalian pain management.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

These evoked responses are different when compared to those evoked by otherwise identical physical stimulation not associated with preceding actions (sensory attenuation). A common model suggests that sensory attenuations are caused by efference signals associated with the binding of actions with sensory outcomes. Nevertheless, the information encoded in such signals is debated, with some theories suggesting they convey predictive information while others suggest they convey global motor information regardless of specific outcome expectations. To address this debate, we recorded EEG data while participants (n=30) learned to associate motor or visual cues with corresponding tones. Following 8 repetitions of cue-tone learning, participants successfully learnt the association (>84% correct). At the neural level, the amplitude of auditory evoked responses (N100) decreased across repetitions, as the binding between cues and tones strengthened. In addition, N100 amplitude was attenuated when preceded by motor vs. visual cues. Most importantly, we did not find an interaction effect between repetition and cue type, suggesting a similar sensory attenuation effect across repetitions. Specifically, we show significant sensory attenuation even at the first repetition, when no expectation could be formed. Thus, our results suggest that the sensory attenuation effect does not change while forming experience with action-outcome contingency. These results have implications for contemporary models of sensorimotor control and predictive mechanisms.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

To further boost near-native identification, we introduce HomRank, a homogeneous RNA ranking method that directly optimizes the selection of near-native conformations from candidate sets, resembling expert evaluation strategies. HomRank achieves 95% and 100% top-1 and top-5 success rates, respectively, significantly outperforming ARES+.

Based on recent experimental and theoretical findings, we constructed a neural circuit model where dopamine neuronal populations receive differential inputs from individual rewards and encode heterogeneous reward prediction errors, which train cortical and striatal neurons to learn reward-associated state representation and value. Learning is achieved via simultaneous 'alignments' of the cortical and striatal downstream connections to the mesocorticolimbic dopamine projections, and inhibition-dominance in the cortical recurrent network is a key for successful learning. Excessive excitation, whether pre-existing or induced by manipulations, leads to aberrant activity, which disrupts the alignments and even causes anti-alignment. This impairs both reward-specific motivational control and credit assignment, potentially explaining the negative and positive symptoms of schizophrenia, respectively. Our model thus provides a mechanistic account for schizophrenia, integrating the different causes and symptoms, with testable predictions.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

B.", "abstract": "The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) has shown potential as a therapeutic target for several neuropsychiatric disorders including major depressive disorder, pain, and substance use disorder. In vivo signaling of G protein coupled receptors like the KOR is generally thought to change in magnitude but not sign in such behavior states. Here we investigated KOR modulation of ventral tegmental area (VTA) neurons following an acute, behaviorally aversive manipulation. We found this switches KOR signaling from inhibitory to excitatory in a subset of VTA dopamine neurons. Brief corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) exposure ex vivo rapidly induces a similar switch in KOR signaling, specifically in dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) projecting neurons, but not nucleus accumbens or basolateral amygdala projecting neurons. These KOR mediated excitations depend on G protein activation, but where somatodendritic VTA KORs activate a K+ conductance to hyperpolarize dopamine neurons in control conditions, depolarizations require HCN channel function. One behavioral impact of this change is a loss of the aversiveness of intra-VTA KOR activation, providing direct evidence that rapid changes in GPCR signaling pathways can be triggered by activity at other GPCRs and significantly alter behavioral responses driven by neuromodulators.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

V.; Ding, Y.; Fiebelkorn, I. C.", "abstract": "The Rhythmic Theory of Attention proposes that visual spatial attention is characterized by alternating states that promote either sampling at the present focus of attention or a higher likelihood of shifting attentional resources to another location. While theta-rhythmically (4-8 Hz) occurring windows of opportunity for shifting attentional resources might provide cognitive flexibility, these windows might also make us more susceptible to distractors. Here, we used EEG in humans to test how frequency-specific neural activity phasically influences behavioral performance and visual processing when high-contrast distractors co-occur with low-contrast targets. For trials with and without distractors, perceptual sensitivity at the cued target location depended on pre-stimulus theta phase (~7 Hz) recorded at central electrodes. For trials with distractors, there was a greater increase in false alarm rates at the same theta phase associated with lower hit rates (i.e., during the proposed 'shifting state'), confirming theta-rhythmically occurring windows of increased susceptibility to distractors. In addition to these phase-behavior effects at central electrodes, we observed phase-behavior effects at frontocentral and occipital electrodes that (i) only occurred on trials with distractors, (ii) peaked in the alpha-frequency range (~9-10 Hz) and (iii) were strongest at occipital electrodes that were contralateral to distractors. Alpha phase at these electrodes was also associated with fluctuations in the amplitude of distractor-evoked visual responses, consistent with an alpha-mediated gating of distractors. The present findings thus provide evidence for distinct theta- and alpha-mediated mechanisms of spatial attention that phasically modulate the influence of distractors on task performance.", "date": "2025-08-10", "journal": ""}

Here, we developed EpiPred, a gene specific machine learning classifier that predicts the pathogenicity of STXBP1 missense variants by integrating computational features with empirical evidence from cellular assays. Trained on a curated set of pathogenic and benign variants, EpiPred outperformed leading global prediction tools in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. We validated the model's predictions using functional assays that measure protein abundance, solubility, stability, and interaction with the SNARE complex partner syntaxin 1. These biochemical readouts aligned closely with model outputs and enabled reclassification of several likely misdiagnosed variants. We deployed EpiPred in an interactive web application that allows clinicians, researchers, and patients to explore predictions for all possible missense variants in STXBP1. Our approach illustrates the power of gene-specific predictive modeling combined with experimental validation to improve variant interpretation and diagnostic resolution.
