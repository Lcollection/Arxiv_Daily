W.; McGlothan, J. L.; Guilarte, T. R.; Allen, T. A.", "abstract": "Chronic early-life lead (Pb2+) exposure contributes to an array of cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions, including impaired attention, memory, and intellectual abilities, in addition to increased social delinquency. Notably, Pb2+ exposure is an environmental risk factor for adult psychopathologies, including schizophrenia and epilepsy. Neurobiologically, Pb2+ is a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, and exposure during early life elicits a cascade of cellular neurotoxic effects that alter neurodevelopmental trajectories. This includes reduced parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the hippocampus (HC) and altered synaptic transmission. Little is known, however, about the impact of chronic Pb2+ exposure on HC network dynamics, which link cellular-molecular effects with cognitive-behavioral consequences. Here, we tested the impact of chronic Pb2+ exposure on the HC local field potential (LFP) in freely behaving rats. We found that Pb2+ exposure (1) caused a striking level of theta rhythmic hypersynchrony, (2) amplified fast gamma synchronization, (3) disrupted behavioral modifications of theta and fast gamma, and (4) exacerbated absence seizures appearing in the LFP as spike-wave discharges (SWDs) at theta frequencies. Each of these rhythmic changes in the HC network was related to exploratory movements in the open field. HC network alterations like these have also been linked to impaired prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex (PPI). Thus, next, we tested the effect of Pb2+ exposure on PPI. We found that adult males (PN50 and 120), but neither females nor juvenile males, showed reduced PPI, recapitulating sex dependencies on PPI disruptions in schizophrenics. Altogether, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that chronic early-life Pb2+ exposure causes dysfunction in the rhythmic network coordination of the HC, limiting processing, and helping to account for cognitive deficits.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we combined mouse genetics and cryo-electron tomography to determine the 3D molecular architecture of fresh isolated and anatomically intact synapses in the adult forebrain. The native glutamatergic synapse did not consistently show a higher density of proteins at the postsynaptic membrane thought to be characteristic of the PSD. Instead, a  synaptoplasm consisting of cytoskeletal elements, macromolecular complexes and membrane-bound organelles extended throughout the pre- and post- synaptic compartments. Snapshots of active processes gave insights into membrane remodeling processes. Clusters of up to 60 ionotropic glutamate receptors were positioned inside and outside the synaptic cleft.

V.; An, W.; Turner, P.", "abstract": "A frequent goal of phage biology is to quantify how well a phage kills a population of host bacteria. Unfortunately, traditional methods to quantify phage success can be time-consuming, limiting the throughput of experiments. Here, we use theory to show how the effects of phages on their hosts can be quantified using bacterial population dynamics measured in a high-throughput microplate reader (automated spectrophotometer). We use mathematical models to simulate bacterial population dynamics where specific phage and bacterial traits are known a priori. We then test common metrics of those dynamics (e.g. growth rate, time and height of peak bacterial density, death rate, extinction time, area under the curve) to determine which best predict: 1) infectivity over the short-term, and 2) phage suppression over the long-term. We find that many metrics predict infectivity and are strongly correlated with one another. We also find that metrics can predict phage growth rate, providing an effective way to quantify the combined effects of multiple phage traits. Finally, we show that peak density, time of peak density, and extinction time are the best metrics when comparing across different bacterial hosts or over longer timescales where plasticity or evolution may play a role. In all, we establish a foundation for using bacterial population dynamics to quantify the effects of phages on their bacterial hosts, supporting the design of in vitro empirical experiments using microplate readers.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Objective Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disorder characterised by deficient hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase activity, leading to elevated phenylalanine levels. Despite adherence to a phenylalanine-restricted diet, many adult PKU patients continue to experience executive function deficits, likely linked to high cerebral phenylalanine concentrations and deficiencies in monoaminergic neurotransmitters. Given the complexity of the interaction between diet and brain neurotransmitter metabolism, we employed computational metabolic modelling alongside experimental data from dietary intervention studies in PKU mice to identify key metabolic drivers underlying these deficits. Our goal was to provide a mechanistic, model-based foundation to support and optimise dietary therapies in PKU. Method We developed a computational model simulating large neutral amino acid (LNAA) transport across the blood-brain barrier and the subsequent metabolism of cerebral amino acids and monoaminergic neurotransmitters. The model was validated using direct measurements of brain amino acid concentrations in PKU mice subjected to various dietary regimens. Results The model predicts that cerebral amino acid levels are primarily influenced by their plasma concentrations and, to a lesser extent, by competition among LNAAs for transport mechanisms. Notably, it suggests that cerebral monoaminergic neurotransmitter levels are more significantly affected by elevated phenylalanine levels, likely through non-competitive inhibition of hydroxylase enzymes, than by the availability of precursor amino acids. Consequently, the model indicates that reducing phenylalanine levels, in conjunction with supplementing tyrosine and tryptophan, is more effective in restoring neurotransmitter levels than precursor supplementation alone. Conclusion This study presents the first comprehensive model integrating LNAA transport and cerebral neurotransmitter metabolism in PKU. The model enhances our understanding of the disease's pathophysiology and highlights the importance of combined therapeutic strategies that target both phenylalanine reduction and precursor amino acid supplementation. Furthermore, it identifies knowledge gaps in LNAA transport mechanisms and offers a framework applicable to other neurological disorders involving diet-gene-neurotransmitter interactions.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

W. D.; Tromer, E. C.; Eme, L.", "abstract": "Chromosome organization ensures accurate DNA replication, segregation, gene regulation and DNA damage repair. Across the tree of life, protein assemblages termed Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes determine chromosome organization. Eukaryotes usually have four SMC complex types (condensin I, condensin II, cohesin, and SMC5/6), whereas prokaryotes mostly have one. The expanded set is probably needed to accommodate the considerably larger eukaryotic genomes. Despite their essential functions, SMC complexes exhibit notable variation among model organisms, suggesting underexplored diversity across eukaryotes. Here, we provide a thorough reconstruction of the evolution of SMC complex subunits and accessory proteins across eukaryotes. We show that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) had all four complete SMC complexes, supporting the notion that LECA was already a sophisticated cell. At later timepoints, condensin II was lost at least thirty times, rendering it one of the most frequently lost eukaryotic cellular machineries. We identify multiple components (e.g., Sororin, Securin, Nse5, and Nse6) as much more ancient and widespread than previously appreciated. Finally, we traced the prokaryotic origins of these complexes and propose an ancient SMC complex was already duplicated in the ancestor of TACK and Asgard archaea, suggesting a sophisticated chromosome organization in the archaeal ancestor of eukaryotes. The eukaryotic SMC complex inventory was further expanded through gene duplications, highlighting the importance of these events in the emergence of eukaryotic complexity. Altogether, our results address questions and raise new ones about how SMC complex evolution affected the genome organizations of ancestral and contemporary organisms.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

A first set of analysis indicated that only downy mildew (DM) significantly affects yield (mass of grape clusters harvested) in our experimental conditions. We then leverage this situation to model the relationship between DM severity (measured by standardized AUDPC) and yield losses at vine stock scale. For AUDPC ranging from 0 to 10%, an increase of the severity of DM of 1% on the clusters decrease yield by 2% regardless of years and sites. These values ranges from 1.1% to 9% when considering the severity of DM on the foliage, depending on sites and years. This variability was correlated with a moisture risk index calculated between crop stages inflorescences visibles to pre-ripening of the berries. An increase of the severity of DM of 1% on the foliage decreases yield by 1.2% during dry year (quantile 10% of the index), by 3.3% during intermediate year (median the index) and by 7.3% during wet year (quantile 90% of the index).

After prolonged genotoxin treatment, the checkpoint can be downregulated to allow cell cycle and growth resumption. In yeast, downregulation of the DNA damage checkpoint requires the Srs2 DNA helicase, which removes the ssDNA binding complex RPA and the associated Mec1 checkpoint kinase from DNA, thus dampening Mec1-mediated checkpoint. However, it is unclear whether the anti-checkpoint role of Srs2 is temporally and spatially regulated to allow timely checkpoint termination while preventing superfluous RPA removal. Here we address this question by examining regulatory elements of Srs2, such as its phosphorylation, sumoylation, and protein-interaction sites. Our genetic analyses and checkpoint level assessment suggest that the RPA countering role of Srs2 is promoted by Srs2 binding to PCNA, which recruits Srs2 to a subset of ssDNA containing regions. RPA antagonism is further fostered by Srs2 sumoylation, which we found depending on the Srs2-PCNA interaction and Mec1, and peaking after Mec1 activity reaches maximal levels. These data suggest that Srs2 recruitment to PCNA proximal ssDNA-RPA filaments followed by its sumoylation can promote checkpoint recovery, whereas Srs2 action is minimized at regions with no proximal PCNA to permit RPA-mediated ssDNA protection.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

P.; Pezzulo, G.", "abstract": "Decision-making is often conceptualized as a serial process, during which sensory evidence is accumulated for the choice alternatives until a certain threshold is reached, at which point a decision is made and an action is executed. This decide-then-act perspective has successfully explained various facets of perceptual and economic decisions in the laboratory, in which action dynamics are usually irrelevant to the choice. However, living organisms often face another class of decisions - called embodied decisions - that require selecting between potential courses of actions to be executed timely in a dynamic environment, e.g., for a lion, deciding which gazelle to chase and how fast to do so. Studies of embodied decisions reveal two aspects of goal-directed behavior in stark contrast to the serial view. First, that decision and action processes can unfold in parallel; second, that action-related components, such as the motor costs associated with selecting a particular choice alternative or required to \"change mind\" between choice alternatives, exert a feedback effect on the decision taken. Here, we show that these signatures of embodied decisions emerge naturally in active inference - a framework that simultaneously optimizes perception and action, according to the same (free energy minimization) imperative. We show that optimizing embodied choices requires a continuous feedback loop between motor planning (where beliefs about choice alternatives guide action dynamics) and motor inference (where action dynamics finesse beliefs about choice alternatives). Furthermore, our active inference simulations reveal the normative character of embodied decisions in ecological settings - namely, achieving an effective balance between a high accuracy and a low risk of missing valid opportunities.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Although supervised deep-learning-based models offer accurate segmentation, their performance degrades for unknown cell types. To address this problem, unsupervised domain adaptation methods based on adversarial training, self-training, or a combination of these approaches have been developed in recent years. These methods train the model using inference labels from the unknown domain as pseudo labels with reliability to resolve the discrepancy between the features of the unknown and known domains. However, conventional methods require a predefined threshold to calculate pseudo-labels reliability, leading to costly hyperparameter tuning. Here, we developed an unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic cell segmentation with cooperative self-learning (CULPICO: Cooperative Unsupervised Learning for PIxel-wise COloring) that does not require predefined threshold of the pseudo-labels reliability. The proposed method consists of two independent segmentation models and a mutual exchange mechanism of inference data. The models infer a label probability at each pixel and generate a pseudo-label as unsupervised learning. The pseudo-labels created by each model are mutually used as ground truth in the other model. Loss function is corrected by considering pixel-level discrepancies between the label probabilities inferred by the two models. The proposed method, despite being an unsupervised learning method, can segment efficiently the unknown cell types without labels with an accuracy comparable to supervised learning models.

Most important, individuals were given chances to learn each partners preference beforehand. As expected, individuals initially believed that partners would make relatively riskier choices than they would.

While many theoretical, computational, and statistical advances have been made in understanding the genomic signatures of selective sweeps in recombining populations, relatively less is understood in populations with little/no recombination, and arbitrary dominance and inbreeding. Using diffusion theory, we obtain the expected site frequency spectrum (SFS) at linked neutral sites immediately post and during the fixation of moderately or strongly beneficial mutations. We find that when a single hard sweep occurs, the SFS decays as 1/x for low derived allele frequencies (x), similar to the neutral SFS at equilibrium, whereas at higher derived allele frequencies, it follows a 1/x2 power law. These power laws are universal in the sense that they are independent of the dominance and inbreeding coefficients, and also characterize the SFS during the sweep. Additionally, we find that the derived allele frequency where the SFS shifts from the 1/x to 1/x2 power law is inversely proportional to the selection strength; thus under strong selection, the SFS follows the 1/x2 dependence for most allele frequencies, resembling a rapidly expanding neutral population. When clonal interference is pervasive, the SFS immediately post-fixation becomes U-shaped and can be approximated by the equilibrium SFS of selected sites. Our results will be important in developing statistical methods to infer the timing and strength of recent selective sweeps in asexual populations, genomic regions that lack recombination, and clonally propagating tumor populations.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Host jumps--defined as the process by which a pathogen establishes sustained transmission in novel hosts--are threats to human and animal welfare, but prediction of successful host jumps remains elusive. A spillover event must precede a host jump, and so spillover rate is thought to be related to risk. However, non-endemic pathogens that spill over frequently have demonstrated a poor ability to host jump from any given spillover. So which is riskier, pathogens that spill over rarely or commonly? Applying a Bayesian framework to a general model of host jump risk, we show that 1) the riskiest pathogens can be those that spill over at low, intermediate, or high rates, and 2) as the rate of spillover gets large, the information gained from past spillovers is exactly counterbalanced by the increased number of future spillovers. Taken together, this means that spillover rate has little to no value for explaining host jump risk. Rather, we show that novel pathogens (i.e. pathogens with a relatively short history of spilling over in their current form) are substantially more likely to result in host jumps than pathogens that have had long-associated opportunities for spillover into the novel host. Therefore novelty, but not spillover rate, is an important predictor of host jump risk.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

However, more flowers may also attract more pollinators to the area. Depending on which process dominates, one or both \"competitors\" may actually benefit from the other's presence: a phenomenon called \"pollination facilitation\" in plant ecology. For example, it has been argued that strips of wildflowers planted next to crops may attract pollinators who \"spill over\" into the crop. Here we mathematically examine the tradeoff between facilitation and competition in consumer attraction. We show that contrary to previous claims, no accelerating benefits of density per se are necessary for facilitation. Instead, under very general assumptions, an imbalance between local competition and joint attraction of consumers can generate a benefit to at least one \"competitor\". This typically leads to maximal benefit to the crop at a low presence of highly attractive \"wildflowers\" (i.e. plants that share pollinators with the crop). Our results generalize to many contexts where local competition may trade off with joint attraction of consumers.

We demonstrate that RIF1-Ex32 splice-in is mediated by an exonic splicing enhancer that is recognized by the splicing factor SRSF1 and antagonized by splicing inhibitors SRSF3 and SRSF7. Exposure to DNA damage inhibited Ex32 splice-in, potentiated the association of SRSF3 and SRSF7 with RIF1 pre-mRNA, and caused an increase in RIF1-S protein expression, which was also observed across a diverse set of primary cancers. Isoform-specific proteomic analyses revealed RIF1-L preferentially associated with mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and sustained MDC1 focus formation to a greater extent than RIF1-S. We further show that the S/K cassette stabilized a novel phase separation activity of the RIF1 CTD and enhanced RIF1-L chromatin retention, which was reversed by CDK1-dependent phosphorylation of the RIF1 CTD in response to G2 DNA damage checkpoint inhibition. These combined findings suggest DNA damage-dependent RIF1 AS contributes to RIF1 functional diversification in genome protection.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

A.; Kekenes-Huskey, P.", "abstract": "The heart adapts to cardiac demand through a variety of mechanisms. Some of these adaptations include chemical modifications of myofilament proteins responsible for cell contraction. Interestingly, many of these chemical modifications, such as phosphorylation, are found in unstructured, or intrinsically disordered, regions of proteins. For these myofilament assoiciated proteins with intrinsic disorder (MAPIDs), it has been difficult to determine how their disordered regions influence the function of the intact protein or the myofilament as a whole. Given that cardiac dysfunction can be accompanied by dramatic shifts in post-translational modifications (PTMs) of myofilament proteins, assessment of these impacts in intrinsically disordered regions is important. We hypothesized that regulation of the actin-binding myofilament protein LIM protein 1, ABLIM1, through its IDRs occurs because PTMs, namely phosphorylation, alter their conformation ensembles. The change in conformations thereby toggles their availability for binding protein partners. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used molecular dynamics to simulate ABLIM1 and thereby determine its conformation ensemble before and after phosphorylation. In accordance with published phosphorylation data in GSK3{beta} knockout models, our results indicate that local changes in the physicochemical properties of ABLIM1's IDRs via phosphorylation can influence its global ensemble properties, with the potential to impact its interaction with myofilament targets like titin.

This study combined EEG with multiple duration perception tasks to evaluate whether individual alpha frequency (IAF) is associated with sensitivity or bias in judging visual durations across a range of peri-second durations (spanning 100-1200ms). In a temporal estimation task, participants (n = 55; 38 female, 13 male, 4 non-binary) reported the duration of a single stimulus between 300-1200ms. In a temporal discrimination task, participants reported which of two stimuli was longer: a standard (100, 600, or 1200ms) or comparison (50-150% of the standard). Stimuli also varied in whether their luminance was static or dynamically varying over time. We found that IAF was significantly related to the variance of duration estimates, a precision measure, but not average duration estimates, a bias measure. Further supporting this relationship, psychometric function slopes obtained from the independent duration discrimination tasks were positively correlated with IAF, particularly for the static stimulus conditions. These individual differences effects held when controlling for participant age. We also explored trial-level variability in alpha frequency and found it was predictive of shifts in the point of subjective equality (PSE) during discrimination of very short (100ms). Taken together, these results suggest that IAF plays a role in shaping individual differences in the sensitivity of time perception and that spontaneous variations around one's IAF can lead to a bias in temporal representations.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Using metallomics and quantification of protein, carbohydrate, and lipid content, we show that infection alters host resource concentrations in ways that depend on parasite virulence. More virulent parasites led to increased protein levels and greater energy demands, evidenced by higher carbohydrate reserves. Additionally, infection with V. culicis impacted host metal content, particularly zinc and manganese, used by V. culicis independently of its evolutionary background. Iron availability, a key nutrient for parasite growth, enhanced spore production, with selected parasite lines better able to exploit host iron than unselected.

Without an empirical gold standard, new inference methods are typically validated using simulated data; however, these simulations may not accurately capture biological complexity and often embed the same assumptions used in the inference methods themselves. Here, we leverage the tendency of HGT events to involve multiple neighboring genes to assess the accuracy of diverse HGT inference methods.

Gene conversions are thought to occur within relatively short tracts of DNA.

In this study, we propose a statistical method to model the length distribution of gene conversion tracts in humans, using nearly one million gene conversion tracts detected from the UK Biobank whole autosome data. To handle the large number of tracts, we designed a computationally efficient inferential framework. Our method further accounts for regional variation in marker density and heterozygosity across the genome, which can influence the observed length of gene conversion tracts. We allow for multiple candidate tract length distributions and select the best fitting distribution using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Applying our method, we estimate that most tracts have a mean of 16.9 bp (95% CI: [16.4, 17.0]), and only a very small proportion of tracts have a much larger mean of 724.7 bp (95% CI: [720.1, 728.7]).

However, the effectiveness of different composts varies and can not yet be predicted. Microbial communities in compost play a key role in disease suppression, and therefore their composition or specific taxa may serve as indicators of suppressive composts. In this study, we investigated 37 composts from seven commercial compost producers to analyze the association of their bacterial and fungal communi-ties with suppressive activity in three plant-pathogen systems: cress-Globisporangium ultimum, cucumber-Globisporangium ultimum and cucumber-Rhizoctonia solani. Our results underscore that compost suppressiveness is primarily pathogen-specific and, to a lesser extent, host-plant-specific. Suppressiveness was not correlated with physico-chemical properties, microbial activity, or the alpha-and beta-diversity of composts bac-terial and fungal communities. Instead, microbial composition was largely shaped by producer-specific composting conditions and maturation processes, which were not nec-essarily linked to suppressive activity. A more nuanced comparison between the most and least suppressive composts revealed bacterial and few fungal taxa as potential indicators of suppressiveness for each plant-pathogen system. Notably, for G. ultimum-suppression, bacteria from the genera Luteimonas, Sphingopyxis, and Algoriphagus and for R. solani bacteria belonging to the phylum Actinomycetota emerged as promising candidates.\n\nImportanceSoilborne diseases are a major yield-limiting factor in agricultural crop production world-wide, particularly in seedling cultivation. Their control remains a significant challenge and still largely relies on chemical fumigation of soils and steam sterilization of pot-ting substrates.

Amending soil or potting substrate with disease-suppressive compost offers a promising alternative. However, the targeted use of compost for plant protection is hindered by variable effec-tiveness and the lack of reliable tools to identify effective composts. This study provides a comprehensive abiotic and biotic characterization of compost, enabling a detailed anal-ysis of the properties associated with suppressiveness.

This confers robust protection from viral diseases but in contrast to numerous other chronic MDA5 hyperactivation states, the mice suffer no autoimmune or other health consequences. Here we find they further confound expectations by being resistant to a strong autoimmunity (lupus) provocation. However, knockout of one allele of Adar breaks the autoinflammation-protected state of RdRptg mice and results in a severe disease that resembles interferonopathies caused by MDA5 gain-of-function protein mutations.

These circumstances highlight the need for widespread adoption of sustainable alternative control measures. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is one such solution, comprising a set of management strategies which focus on the long-term prevention, detection and control of pests, weeds and diseases. While many of these methods are acknowledged to offer effective control, their implementation has thus far been limited in practice.

We used epidemiological modelling techniques to investigate the potential of different IPM control strategies (crop residue burial, delayed sowing, variety mixtures and biocontrols). Combining existing data with a deterministic, compartmental infectious disease model of STB transmission, we simulated the implementation of an IPM regime into the STB disease system. We investigated the outcomes on disease prevalence and crop yield when comparing conventional and IPM control regimes. In a single field, for the individual implementation of IPM measures we found the starkest difference in potential yield outcomes between delayed sowing and biocontrols (greatest yields), and crop residue burial and variety mixtures (lowest yields). We also found that the collective use of IPM measures has the potential to offer individual growers comparable control to a standard fungicide regime. For a multi-field setting, representing a community of crop growers, a high proportion of growers using IPM can reduce the level of external infection incurred by the growers who maintain a fungicide regime.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Gut O- and N-glycans are thought to play central roles in barrier function, host defense, nutrition and attachment for commensals and pathogens, immunoregulation and cell-cell interactions. However, the precise nature of the glycans and how glycan composition changes through development, as a function of diet, and during inflammation, remains incompletely understood. Here, we apply O- and N-glycomic platforms to profile glycans on mucus and intestinal epithelium. By mapping individual glycan species spatially and temporally we identify 57 O- and 18 N-glycans in the mouse intestine, and observe that fucosylation and sialylation varies according to intestinal region and developmental stage. We identify a subset of glycans regulated by the gut microbiome, and observe a constriction of the glycan repertoire during inflammation in both mice and humans. Together, these results provide an atlas of individual intestinal glycans and their dynamic range through ontogeny and inflammation, and represent a significant resource for our understanding of the role of intestinal glycans in health and disease and glycan-focused therapies for intestinal inflammation and shaping the gut microbiome.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

However, the underlying mechanisms influencing serotonin levels a critical neurotransmitter implicated in depression and a primary target for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remain inadequately understood. In this study, we employed a restrained inescapable shock (RIS) model to investigate these mechanisms in mice. The RIS paradigm elicited depressive-like phenotypes, increased c-Fos expression in the amygdala, diminished serotonin levels, and elevated corticosterone concentrations. Notably, chemogenetic inhibition of the amygdala mitigated depressive symptoms, reduced neuronal activity in this region, and restored serotonin levels. Anatomical analyses revealed a significant connectivity between the central amygdala (CeA) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). Fiber photometry recordings indicated that serotonergic neuronal activity in the DRN decreased in response to aversive stimuli, accompanied by amygdala activation following RIS, with no notable alterations in DRN GABAergic activity. These findings suggest that chronic stress may exacerbate amygdala hyperactivity, which subsequently inhibits serotonin release in the brain, potentially intensifying depressive states. Therefore, targeting amygdala hyperactivity may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of stress-related depressive and anxiety disorders.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce a similarity measure among competing substructures called profiles.

Indeed, vestibular dysfunction constitutes a major medical concern, as one of its manifestation, dizziness, affects 15-35% of the general population, with a prevalence rate of 85% for those over 80 of age. Age-related alterations of both vestibular function and the integrity of vestibular hair cells has been reported in humans. However, direct comparisons between structural pathology and vestibular dysfunctions quantifications are lacking in humans and rather limited in animal models, representing a significant gap in current knowledge. Thus far, therapeutic trials in animal models targeting vestibular loss associated with genetic diseases have yielded varied and partial results, and the functional identity and quantity of hair cells sufficient to restore minimal or normal vestibular function remain undefined. Here, we further develop an innovative methodology to bridge the gap between hair cells integrity and functional vestibular loss in individuals. Gradual vestibular deficits were induced through a dose-dependent ototoxic compound, quantified with canal or utricular-specific vestibulo-ocular reflex tests, and were then correlated in all individuals with the loss of type I and type II hair cells in different regions of ampulla and macula. Our findings reveal that the structure-function relationship is nonlinear, with lower bound of approximately 50% of hair cells necessary to retain minimal vestibular function, and threshold exceeding 80% to preserve normal function, thus shedding light on population-coding mechanisms for vestibular response.

We performed longitudinal clustering to group patients based on symptom trajectories and cognitive performance. The resulting clusters were compared on cross-sectional variables, including independent measures of severity as well as polygenic risk scores, serum protein quantification, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation.\n\nResultsWe identified two distinct clusters of patients that exhibited marked differences in illness severity but did not differ significantly in age, sex, or diagnostic proportions.

A widely used approach is network modeling, where electrodes are represented as nodes. A key challenge lies in defining the network edges and weights, as precise connectivity estimation is critical for enhancing neural characterization and extracting discriminative features, such as those needed for task decoding. In this work, we propose a method for inferring subject-specific brain graphs from EEG data, explicitly designed to exhibit small-world and scale-free network properties. Our approach begins by computing phase-locking values between EEG channel pairs to build a backbone graph, which is then refined into an individualized small-world and scale-free network. To reduce computational complexity while preserving subject-specific characteristics, we apply Kron reduction to the resulting graph. We evaluated the proposed method on motor imagery decoding and brain fingerprinting tasks using two EEG datasets. Results show that our model consistently outperforms other benchmark graph models. Furthermore, we show that integrating classical EEG features with those derived using graph signal processing principles significantly improves performance. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of the proposed graph construction framework to enhance EEG analysis, with promising implications for a wide range of applications in cognitive neuroscience and brain-computer interface research.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

However, evolutionary processes result in different patterns of relationship among samples in local genomic regions as compared to the genome-wide aggregate. Recently, these local patterns of relatedness have been used to identify regions under selection and inverted segments.

Our method, Local Decomposition and Similarity to All Regions (LODESTAR), uses Procrustes Analysis to assess the similarity between local MDS results computed using pairwise allele sharing distances or a set of user-defined points. Given two sets of points, Procrustes Analysis computes the optimal rotation and scaling that fits one set of points onto the other, while maintaining the relative relationship between points within both sets. We use the Procrustes statistic to measure the similarity between the two sets of points. We show how this method can be used to explore local relatedness patterns that mirror sampling geography or population stratification by performing Procrustes analysis between local relatedness plots and coordinates representing sampling geography or between local relatedness plots and the genome-wide relatedness plot, respectively.

Our analysis identified seven major cell types across 11 brain regions and further characterized glial subtypes--microglia and astrocytes-- revealing subtype-specific chromatin accessibility changes in 5xFAD mice relative to controls. These alterations were associated with AD-related pathways, including neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation, and synaptic dysfunction and neuronal signaling in microglia, as well as lysosomal and proteasomal activity, lipoprotein metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction in astrocytes. We also characterized cell-type-specific enrichments of motifs and transcription factors, including enrichment of Bcl11a in microglia. Furthermore, we linked chromatin accessibility changes in 5xFAD mice to human AD risk genes, highlighting altered epigenetic signatures in genes such as Trem2. Supporting the spatial ATAC-seq findings, flow cytometry validated a selective increase in VISTA (encoded by Vsir) protein expression in 5xFAD microglia, supporting the spatial ATAC-seq findings and indicating a shift toward a pro-inflammatory, disease-associated microglial (DAM-like) phenotype.

Subsequent validation and testing can be performed through pot, greenhouse, and field trials.

Crystal packing and anomalous scattering reveal that this crystal form is mediated by two ordered nickel ions provided by the crystallization buffer. Nickel coordination occurs in a 2:2 stoichiometry which dimerizes two SH3 domain monomers across a pseudo-twofold rotation axis and involves the native N-terminal c-Src SH3 amino acid sequence, a surface-exposed histidine residue, and ordered water molecules.

Here we observe that nitrate-limited Prochlorococcus have cell-specific nitrite production rates that are approximately a magnitude higher than nitrogen-replete Prochlorococcus when challenged with a pulse of nitrate. Nitrite production rates are unchanged or depressed during light and cold shocks, suggesting that nitrate is not used as an alternative electron acceptor to mitigate the impacts of excess photochemically generated electrons. These results suggest that in regions where phytoplankton growth is limited by nitrogen, Prochlorococcus cells could be primed to transform substantial quantities of nitrate into extracellular pools of nitrite during episodic upwellings of nitrate-rich water.

Considered too ephemeral, these crops are nevertheless responsible for the absorption and storage of approximately one-third of the carbon biofixed by photosynthesis, with half-lives that are not limited to a single season but extend on average over 8.9 years. The kinetics of variation in carbon capture and release by cultivated plants over the half-century were simulated using two error functions which made it possible to complete the probabilistic calculation of the carbon budget components. In 2023, all cultivated plants--crops, grasslands, and forest plantations--had a stored carbon half-life of 17.6 years. They had removed 39.2{+/-}0.5 billion tonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) per year from the atmosphere, more than global emissions from hydrocarbon combustion. The time distribution allowed by this simulation suggests that cultivated plants will have biofixed a cumulative net total of 455 GtCO2 in 2023, or 14% of the mass of atmospheric CO2. Given the importance of carbon capture and storage by cultivated plants, both in duration and quantity, rural activities should be integrated into carbon budgets and the resulting climate strategies and recognized as a carbon capture and storage (CCS) device in carbon cycle regulation policies.

IDPs are heterogeneous, existing in a conformational ensemble of various interconnected states without a definitive tertiary structure. The high dynamicity of IDPs limits ensemble protein characterisation techniques from capturing their properties, and measurements at the single-molecule level are hampered by the necessity to label the protein or modify its microenvironment, affecting their biophysics. Consequently, our understanding of IDPs is limited, translating to a lack of knowledge of their roles in related diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and various cancers. This work presents the first experimental observation of unmodified IDP conformational dynamics in vitro, at the single-molecule level in real time, achieved by trapping individual IDPs in a nanoscale volume using aperture-based plasmonic nanotweezers. Our results reveal that IDPs exhibit significantly larger conformational variation in solution compared to globular proteins of similar size, as expected, enabling clear differentiation between the two categories.

Despite the significant array of experimental and computational data, many aspects of their function and dynamics remain unclear - such as how ion permeation is halted in the closed state of the channel. Available CryoEM structures obtained in deactivating conditions capture the channel with a wide, unobstructed pore, in contrast to e.g. a helix bundle crossing observed in some K+ channels. Several hypotheses of BK closure were proposed, including selectivity filter and hydrophobic gating. In this work, we expand on the model of hydrophobic gating and focus on the role of lipids. Based on our atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we propose lipid entrance into the pore - either with lipid tails or entire lipid molecules - through the membrane-facing fenestrations to be a critical determinant of BK conductivity. Furthermore, we elucidate the mechanism of BK activation by negatively charged lipids, and suggest that they act by a multi-modal mechanism, which encompasses lipid entry reduction, increase of the K+ occupancy of the pore, and stabilization of the channel open-state structure - in broad agreement with experimental data.

Building on our prior work in {beta}-cells, we sought to determine whether the mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) cycle is involved in -cell amino acid sensing. Methods: To investigate amino acid regulation of -cells at the cellular level, we measured intracellular Ca2+ (GCaMP6s imaging), membrane potential (JEDI-2P imaging and patch-clamp), KATP channel activity, and glucagon secretion. Three different methods were used to probe the PEP cycle, including pyruvate kinase activators (TEPP-46), and mice with -cell specific deletion of pyruvate kinase M1/M2 (PKM1/2-KO) or mitochondrial PEP carboxykinase (PCK2-KO). Results: The mitochondrial fuels glutamine/leucine antagonized alanine/arginine-stimulated Ca2+ influx and glucagon secretion under hypoglycemic conditions. Both pyruvate kinase and PCK2 were required for glutamine/leucine to close KATP channels and limit amino acid-stimulated membrane depolarization. The Ca2+ response to amino acids was blocked by pyruvate kinase activation with TEPP-46, and enhanced by -cell deletion of pyruvate kinase or PCK2 - all without changing glucagon secretion. Finally, using diazoxide/KCl to probe the pathways downstream of membrane depolarization, we identified an essential role of the PEP cycle in homeostatically restoring intracellular Ca2+ levels. Conclusions: The -cell mitochondrial PEP cycle senses glutamine/leucine and inhibits KATP channels similarly to {beta}-cells, while restricting amino acid stimulated membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx. However, none of the amino acids tested, including alanine/arginine, regulate glucagon secretion by modulating membrane depolarization or intracellular Ca2+.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Intriguingly, a pheromone-like factor, present in male conditioned medium (CM), has also been implicated in SP formation. To clarify the relative contributions of nitrogen starvation and pheromone signaling, we conducted semi-quantitative analyses of SP induction using synchronously cultured male colonies of Eudorina. When CM was added to male cultures during an early maturation stage, most colonies formed SPs regardless of nitrogen availability. However, when the CM was diluted 100- to 100,000-fold, SP formation was significantly more efficient under nitrogen-depleted conditions than under nitrogen-replete conditions. Notably, SPs never formed without the addition of CM, even in a nitrogen-depleted medium. The SP-inducing activity of the CM was found to markedly decrease with protease treatment. These findings suggest that spermatogenesis in Eudorina is induced by a proteinaceous sex pheromone secreted by male colonies, and that nitrogen depletion, while not essential, enhances this pheromone activity.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

H.; Ravin, R.; Cai, T. X.; Rey, J. A.; Basser, P. J.", "abstract": "Porous materials, such as biological tissue, often have heterogeneous microstructures where imbibed fluid spins experience distinct environments on shorter timescales but can exchange between these environments over longer timescales. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods such as diffusion exchange spectroscopy (DEXSY) can measure this exchange under steady-state and equilibrium conditions; however, modeling becomes more complex when more than two exchanging environments are involved. This complexity is particularly relevant in the central nervous system (CNS), where water diffusion and exchange at the cellular level play critical roles in homeostasis. While DEXSY can measure these processes, they may not be as simple as two-site exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces (ICS and ECS). Here we theoretically study the behavior of apparent exchange rate constants (AXR) estimated from DEXSY data numerically simulated using a three-site exchange model (3XM). The 3XM was developed based on gray matter microstructural characteristics, incorporating both transmembrane exchange between ECS and ICS and geometric exchange between environments within ICS where water mobility differs due to the complex architecture of neurons, glial cells, and the ECS. Inspired by the Na+/K+--ATPase pump--leak model of cell volume maintenance, the 3XM accounts for effects of osmolytes, ions, and voltage on ECS and ICS volume fraction. The model predicts a significant reduction in AXR and a smaller decrease in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) following the level of membrane depolarization expected from Na+/K+--ATPase inhibition. These changes were reversed by the addition of membrane-impermeable ECS osmolytes, independent of voltage, in agreement with previous experiments. While the exchange rate constants for each pathway simply follow first-order kinetics, the AXR's sensitivity to these pathways depend on the ECS volume fraction. When ECS is present, transmembrane exchange dominates, but when cells swell following pump inhibition, geometric exchange becomes the dominant pathway.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

The capacity of this fungus to colonise and cause disease relies on its ability to grow within the host, adapting to various nutrient restrictions and physicochemical conditions. The presence of alternative carbon sources, such as the lactate produced by the local microbiota, influences C. albicans antifungal drug resistance and immune evasion. In this study, we used genome-wide transcriptomic analysis to investigate the effect of lactate exposure upon metabolic rewiring. We provide evidence that C. albicans cells respond to growth in the presence of lactate at pH 5 by regulating genes encoding micronutrient transporters, notably iron transporters. More specifically, lactate triggers the downregulation of genes on the reductive iron uptake pathway, inferring a diminished requirement for high-affinity iron uptake. This is supported by the observation that lactate promotes the intracellular accumulation of iron by C. albicans cells. Lactate even enhances the growth of iron-transport defective C. albicans cells under iron-limited conditions. Lactate is known to activate protein kinase A (PKA) signalling. However, lactate-induced iron assimilation is PKA-independent. This work provides new insights into the role of lactate in iron homeostasis - two important factors that promote C. albicans virulence in the mammalian host, where nutritional immunity is a key antimicrobial strategy.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we present computational models of the full pRb pocket domain (pRbAB), incorporating the flexible linker (pRbPL) that connects boxes A and B. Three models, generated by ROBETTA and AlphaFold, were used to explore the mechanisms by which phosphorylation at Ser608 and Ser612 influence the interaction of pRbAB with E2F transactivation domain (E2FTA). All models revealed a short helix (residues 602 to 607), similar to that observed in a previously published crystal structure of pRbAB with shortened pRbPL linker and phosphomimetic mutation at Ser608, with E2FTA (PDB:4ELL), and proposed to competitively inhibit E2FTA binding. Interestingly, this helix formed irrespective of phosphorylation, indicating that additional factors influencing the interaction upon phosphorylation. In our models, the pRbPL linker displayed significant motion, especially near Ser608 and Ser612, facilitating phosphorylation, but without inducing large conformational changes in the pocket domains. Phosphorylation at Ser608 and Ser612 resulted in changes in multiple parameters including electrostatic properties, compactness and energy landscape of pRbAB constituting important mechanisms that promote E2F release. Additionally, recapitulating known R661W mutation in these models correctly showed reduced E2FTA binding, demonstrating the predictive power of these models to study the effects of missense mutations on the stability, conformation and interactions of pRbAB with E2FTA.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

To counteract this, they have evolved a series of conserved defense networks which monitor organellar function and the accumulation of aberrant molecular signals. As mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to a variety of pathologies, including metabolic impairment, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and sensitivity to bacterial infections, understanding these mitochondrial surveillance pathways is crucial.\n\nPrevious research in our lab established that one such pathway, the Ethanol Stress and Response Element (ESRE), was activated by a broad range of stresses, including exposure to the Gram-negative, opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In this report we show that MDT-15 and its downstream effectors, fatty acid desaturases FAT-6 and FAT-7, were required for ESRE activation. Interestingly, supplementation with fatty acids downstream of FAT-6/FAT-7 activity, from C. elegans PUFA pathway, rescued ESRE activation in their knockdowns. Additionally, disruption of mdt-15, or its downstream effector fat-6 by RNAi diminished worm survival during exposure to P. aeruginosa, indicating that these genes play a role in host defense. Notably, box C/D snoRNPs complex that we previously identified as an activator of ESRE, is required for upregulation of fatty acid metabolism under ESRE-activating conditions.

Using in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models, we evaluate and compare their potential toxicity on healthy tissues. Methods Cell survival, tissue response, and developmental toxicity were assessed across three biological models. In vitro, human fibroblasts (MRC5-hTERT) were used to generate post-irradiation survival curves. Ex vivo, precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) from mice were analyzed for radiation-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. In vivo, zebrafish embryos were used to evaluate developmental toxicity through body length and spinal curvature measurements. VHEE irradiations were performed at 50 MeV using the Salle Jaune LPA (Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquee, France), while CIEE exposures were performed with a 7 MeV conventional LINAC (Institut Curie, France). Results In vitro MRC5-hTERT cells showed similar radiosensitivity between VHEE and CIEE, with comparable D10 values (6.71 {+/-} 1.09 Gy for VHEE; 6.38 {+/-} 0.42 Gy for CIEE; p-value = 0.7). In the ex vivo model, both beams induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell division with no significant inter-beam differences at any dose level (p-value > 0.99). In vivo, zebrafish embryos exhibited dose-dependent body shortening and increased spinal curvature following both VHEE and CIEE exposure. No significant differences were observed between the two modalities at matched doses for any measured metric (p-values [&ge;] 0.495). Conclusion This study presents the first comprehensive radiobiological evaluation of a laser-driven VHEE beam across multiple biological models. The results demonstrate that VHEE and CIEE irradiations exhibit similar biological toxicity.

The widespread availability of scholarly metadata on scientific publications makes it possible to examine how science has evolved over time. Here, we use OpenAlex metadata to examine potential trends in two groups of peer-reviewed research journals: disciplinary journals in biology, chemistry, economics, medicine, physics, and political science, and multidisciplinary journals that publish articles from multiple fields. Supporting existing perceptions, we find an almost universal trend towards increasing internationalization of both sets of journals. Nevertheless, we find disparities: journals in medicine are less international than journals in other disciplines and are not increasing their levels of internationalization, whereas journals in physics appear to be segregating between those that are international and those that are not. We also find that multidisciplinary journals have undergone significant shifts in their disciplinary focuses over the past century, whereas disciplinary journals appear to have largely maintained their degree of interdisciplinarity.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

However, it remains unclear to what extent these differences reflect individual levels present at young adulthood or diverging aging trajectories at later ages. In this study, we analyze the aging dynamics of the volume of six brain structures based on MRI scans from a large cross-cohort longitudinal sample of cognitively healthy adults (n = 8,311 with 18,520 MRIs, ages from 18 to 97 years). From general assumptions about structural brain dynamics and measurement noise, a stochastic dynamical model was fit to the data to estimate both the variability and persistence of structural changes across adulthood. Using this model, we calculated how much of the variance in individual volumetric differences can be attributed to stable levels from young adulthood versus systematic changes at older ages, as well as the theoretical sensitivity of longitudinal studies to detect individual differences in changes. The findings were as follows: 1) Before age 60 years, inter-individual differences in neuroanatomical volumes almost exclusively reflect stable differences between individuals, while the influence from systematic differences in rate-of-change increases thereafter; up to 40 % of the variation being due to differences in change at 80 years. In contrast, ventricular volume reflects differences in change from early adulthood. 2) Current brain age-models are unlikely to be sensitive to detect differences in aging trajectories. 3) Imaging studies have a low reliability to detect inter-individual brain change before age 60. After 60 years, the study reliability increases sharply with longer intervals between scans and more modestly with additional intermediate observations.

As they often have non-restorative sleep, we investigated whether the structure of their sleep is abnormal. Methods: In polysomnography recordings from 80 IH participants and 48 controls, we quantified hypnodensity metrics across the night (macro level), periodic and aperiodic spectral properties, infraslow fluctuations of sigma power within the night (meso level), slow waves, sleep spindles and their clustering (microstructure). Multivariate machine-learning models were used to classify IH vs. control sleep. Results: Hypnodensity metrics were comparable between IH and controls, apart from more mixed wake/N1 sleep epochs in IH, and greater divergence between consecutive epochs of the same stage during NREM sleep in IH. Sigma power was increased in N2 sleep in IH and sleep spindles were more frequent and clustered. Slow wave density was higher in IH. Higher mean spindle cluster size correlated with higher Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores. Multivariate machine learning models incorporating these features achieved a balanced accuracy of 74% in distinguishing IH from controls.

However, the mapping success, i.e. the extent to which these mappings correctly reflect biological similarities and differences between query and reference, varies with e.g. experimental confounders in the data (dissociation protocol, single-cell assay) or the mapping method used, and cannot be predicted in advance. Moreover, an unsuccessful mapping can result in falsely reporting technical artifacts as disease or perturbation-specific cellular changes and in overlooking true altered states. Here, we present MapQC, a method that quantifies query-to-reference mapping success by leveraging the information present in the reference embedding. Specifically, MapQC tests the presence of remaining batch effect in the embedding after mapping by comparing inter-sample distances in the healthy reference itself to distance of query control samples to the reference. Similarly, it tests whether disease or perturbation-specific variation has been retained during mapping by testing whether query perturbed samples are more distant to the reference than reference samples are from each other. We apply MapQC to lung and endometrial query datasets, including data of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and Asherman Syndrome, mapped to large-scale healthy references. We show that MapQC correctly distinguishes successful mappings from unsuccessful ones where data visualization techniques such as UMAP can be deceiving, and that mapQC outperforms integration metrics often re-purposed for mapping quality-control. Moreover, only mappings that MapQC identified as successful result in the correct identification of cell state changes specific to disease. Taken together, MapQC provides a critical quality-control metric for a more reliable, robust, and accurate use of reference atlases to study disease.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

In plants, tissue damage induces rapid responses that activate defense, regeneration and wound healing. While early wound signaling mediated by phytohormones, electrical signals and reactive oxygen species is well-characterized, the mechanisms governing the final stages of wound healing remain poorly understood. Here, we show that wounding in Arabidopsis leaves induces localized cooling, likely due to evaporative water loss, accompanied by the activation of cold-responsive genes. The subsequent disappearance of localized cooling and deactivation of cold-responsive genes serve as a quantitative marker of wound healing. Based on these observations, we developed a workflow by leveraging computer vision and deep learning to monitor the dynamics of wound healing. We found that CBFs transcription factors relay injury-induced cooling signal to wound healing. Thus, our work advances our understanding of tissue repair and provides a tool to quantify wound healing in plants.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

The striatum, a component of the basal ganglia, plays a critical role in licking onset; however, it is unclear how the two compartments of the striatum, the matrix and striosomes, contribute to the control of licking onset. In this study, we used male and female transgenic mice that selectively expressed Cre recombinase in matrix or striosome neurons and subjected them to operant conditioning based on licking of a spout, during which neuronal activity in both compartments was measured using fiber photometry. Only matrix neurons showed responses prior to licking onset. In addition, the matrix neural response before licking onset was larger when mice licked a spout ipsilateral to the recording hemisphere of the brain than that observed when licking the contralateral spout. This response was observed similarly in mice conditioned to receive a reward regularly and those conditioned to receive a reward randomly, suggesting that the response was unrelated to whether the reward was predictable or unpredictable. Matrix neural activity was negatively correlated with the number of licks during the water intake behavior following the first lick. These findings suggest that matrix neurons are involved in the preparatory process for licking onset as well as in the regulation of licking frequency during water intake.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Neuropeptides modulate neural circuits with flexibility because one gene can produce either multiple copies of the same neuropeptide or different neuropeptides. However, with this architectural complexity, the function of discrete and active neuropeptides is muddled. Here, we design a genetic tool that facilitates functional analysis of individual peptides. We engineered Escherichia coli bacteria to express active peptides, fed loss-of-function Caenorhabditis elegans, and rescued the activity of genes with varying lengths and functions: pdf-1, flp-3, ins-6, and ins-22. Some peptides were functionally redundant, while others exhibit unique and previously uncharacterized functions.

The researchers developed a method to create DNA vectors that encode an endogenous peptide sequence flanked by sequences containing dibasic endopeptidase cleavage sites in Caenorhabditis elegans. The researchers transformed these vectors into bacteria and fed them to C. elegans, which restored wildtype behavior in neuropeptide loss-of-function mutants.

These routes of defense evolution are not mutually exclusive and can operate simultaneously, but empirical observations suggest that at least in some bacterial and archaeal species, one or the other route dominates the defense landscape. We hypothesized that the observed dichotomy stems from different life-history tradeoffs characteristic of these organisms. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed a mathematical model of a well-mixed prokaryote population under a stochastically changing viral prevalence. Optimization of the long-term population growth rate reveals two contrasting modes of defense evolution. In stable, predictable and fluctuating, unpredictable environments with a moderate viral prevalence, direct interaction with the virus and horizontal transfer of defense genes become the optimal routes of immunity acquisition, respectively. In the HGT-dominant mode, we observed a universal distribution of the fraction of microbes with different immune repertoires. Under very low virus prevalence, the cost of immunity exceeds the benefits such that the optimal state of a prokaryote is complete defense systems. By contrast, under very high virus prevalence, horizontal spread of defense systems dominates regardless of the stability of the virome. These findings might explain consistent but enigmatic patterns in the spread of antivirus defense systems among prokaryotes such as the ubiquity of adaptive immunity in hyperthermophiles contrasting their patchy distribution among mesophiles.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

An increasing body of empirical evidence links sustained tonic M/EEG activity to evidence accumulation and tracking the predictability, or inferred precision, of the auditory stimulus. However, it remains unclear whether, and how, this process depends on auditory contextual memory. In the present EEG study, we examined neural responses to sound sequences across two experiments, and compared them to predictions from ideal observer models with varying memory spans. Stimuli were sequences of 50 ms long tone-pips. In Experiment 1 (N=26; both sexes), a regularly repeating sequence of 10 tones (REG) transitioned directly to a different regular sequence (REGxREGy). In Experiment 2 (N=28; both sexes), the same regular sequence was repeated after an intervening random segment (REGxINTREGx). Results from Experiment 2 revealed that the inferred predictability of the resumed REGx pattern was influenced by the preceding INT tones, even several seconds after they ended, indicating that the brain retains contextual memory over time. In contrast, neural responses in Experiment 1 were best explained by models with minimal memory. This dissociation implies that the brain can dynamically adjust its strategy based on inferred environmental structure: resetting context when interruptions signal change, and preserving context when patterns are likely to resume.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we show that the successive expression of mouse transcription factors Onecut2, Pou2f2 and Pou3f1 within the cardinal classes giving rise to motor and sensory circuits, correlates with the emergence of sequentially generated subpopulations of neurons within those domains. We demonstrate that the genetic loss of Pou2f2 results in impaired development of two early-born motor neuron columns and re-specification of anterolateral system projection neurons as a later-born subset. Similarly, we show that Pou3f1 expression is required for the normal development of later-born subsets of motor neurons and anterolateral system projection neurons.

Phase-separated condensates (droplet-like clusters) of transcription factors (TFs) are thought to facilitate such long-range enhancer-promoter (E-P) communication, but the quantitative principles underlying this mechanism remain unclear. Here we use polymer-based chromatin simulations to systematically vary the strength of TF clustering and the E-P genomic distance, examining their combined effects on E-P contact formation. We find that E-P contact frequency shows a non-monotonic dependence on the degree of TF clustering: contact frequency peaks at an intermediate TF abundance and TF-TF affinity, leading to a \"golden mean\" optimum. Two distinct regimes emerge: under weak TF-TF attraction, contact probability increases with condensate size, whereas strong TF attraction produces a peaked response that declines at high condensation levels. These results indicate that TF condensate acts as a tunable \"rheostat\", buffering E-P interactions against increasing genomic distances. However, excessive TF clustering leads to molecular crowding and competition that ultimately impair E-P communication. Our study, consistent with recent experiments, establishes a mechanistic framework at molecular level, where balanced TF condensation enables robust long-range E-P communication, reconciling the stochastic nature of chromatin dynamics with the fidelity of gene regulation.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

In the model plant Arabidopsis, two ethylene-sensitive synthetic transcriptional reporters have been described, 5xEBS:GUS and 10x2EBS-S10:GUS. These reporters harbor a different type, arrangement, and number of homotypic cis-elements in their promoters and thus may recruit the ethylene master regulator EIN3 in the context of alternative transcriptional complexes.

We show that in Arabidopsis, EBSn outperforms its predecessors in terms of its ethylene sensitivity, having the capacity to monitor endogenous levels of ethylene and displaying more ubiquitous expression in response to the exogenous hormone.

TPP successfully detected known cysteine-utilizing enzymes, validating its utility in plant metabolic research. Among newly identified targets were two aminotransferases annotated as alanine and aspartate aminotransferases that catalyze the transamination of cysteine to 3-mercaptopyruvate in vitro. These enzymes, together with the sulfurtransferase STR1 and the persulfide dioxygenase ETHE1, reconstituted a complete mitochondrial cysteine catabolic pathway. Kinetic data indicate that alanine aminotransferase, in particular, may function in vivo under physiological cysteine levels. Additionally, GABA aminotransferase was inhibited by cysteine, suggesting a regulatory role in stress metabolism. Beyond enzyme identification, the dataset provides a resource for exploring cysteine-mediated regulation of transporters, RNA-editing factors, and respiratory components. Given cysteine's emerging role as a metabolic signal in stress responses, and the importance of allosteric regulation in amino acid metabolism, these findings highlight the broader regulatory potential of cysteine-protein interactions in plants.

We then monitored circuit-specific molecular programs that diverge between consolidated and forgotten memories. We identified multiple distinct waves of transcription, i.e., cellular macrostates, specifically in the thalamo-cortical circuit, that defined memory persistence. Notably, a small set of transcriptional regulators orchestrated broad molecular programs that enabled entry into these macrostates. Targeted CRISPR-knockout studies revealed that while these transcriptional regulators had no effects on memory formation, they had prominent, causal, and strikingly time-dependent roles in memory stabilization.

In a longitudinal dataset, MegaTrack demonstrated improved reproducibility across time points and higher inter-rater reliability compared to manual dissections. In a motor neuron disease cohort, MegaTrack replicated known group differences in corticospinal tract microstructure with comparable sensitivity to manual dissections (p = 0.001) but with significantly reduced processing time. Finally, we showcase MegaTrack's scalability by creating a comprehensive white matter atlas from 140 healthy adults and demonstrate its application for lesion analysis in stroke patients. This framework is accompanied by an interactive online tool that allows users to explore these atlases and perform customised lesion analyses. The MegaTrack framework is a time-efficient solution for the anatomically precise analysis of large tractography datasets, enabling the rapid simultaneous dissection of multiple subjects while preserving individual anatomical features. The framework's ability to efficiently process large datasets makes it an excellent tool for generating training data for machine learning and deep learning algorithms in tractography analysis. This approach has broad applications in both research and clinical settings, from group comparisons to personalised lesion mapping, and can significantly contribute to the development of advanced automated tractography methods.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Indeed, isoforms make recognition modules in combination to generate recognition diversity far exceeding the ~60 individual CAMs. However, there is also growing evidence for specialized functions for specific isoforms, particularly the C-type isoforms found at the 3 prime ends of the Pcdha cluster (C1 and C2) and at the 3 prime end of the Pcdhg cluster ({gamma}C3, {gamma}C4, and {gamma}C5). We have previously described unique roles for {gamma}C3 in dendrite arborization in the cerebral cortex and neural circuit formation in the spinal cord, as well as for {gamma}C4 in neuronal survival. Here we report a new mouse mutant specifically targeting the Pcdhgc5 exon encoding {gamma}C5. Unlike the rest of the Pcdhg cluster, expression of this isoform does not begin until postnatal stages of mouse development, increasing in the second week of life, suggesting specialized roles. We found significant expression changes in gene pathways involved in synaptic activity, learning and memory, and cognition.

These processes are tightly controlled, and one of the key modulators involved is the endocannabinoid system, particularly through the cannabinoid receptor type-1 (CB1). CB1 is widely expressed in various hippocampal cell types. While it is known that CB1 participates in memory processes, its specific roles in different cell types and how these roles may differ between sexes remain unclear. This study investigates how CB1 signaling in the hippocampus, in both, cell-type-specific and sex-dependent manner, contributes to navigation and memory. To this end, we selectively deleted CB1 receptors from neurons, CAMKII-expressing neurons, and astrocytes from the hippocampus of adult male and female mice. We then assessed its effect on a broad range of behaviors, including innate emotional responses, memory, navigation, and other hippocampus-related functions such as nesting. Deletion of CB1 in CAMKII-expressing neurons produced a pronounced effect in males, leading to increased anxiety and impairments in both reference and spatial memory. These mice also showed altered performance in the Barnes maze, relying less on spatial strategies. By contrast, females were less affected by this specific deletion. Interestingly, only deletion of CB1 from astrocytes led to spatial memory impairments in females, which also showed reduced LTP and a decreased reliance on spatial strategies in the Barnes maze. In conclusion, our findings show that neuronal CB1 receptors are critical for the spatial navigation strategy in males, while astrocytic CB1 receptors play a key role in memory processes both in males and females.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Rather than resulting in minor, quantitative differences, we find that these more realistic systems display qualitatively distinct behaviours compared to simple Turing models. By combining large-scale simulations with formal mathematical proofs, we show, rather generally, that patterning is strongly constrained by the extracellular interactions in the system but is relatively insensitive to the intracellular dynamics assumed. When applied to the activator-inhibitor paradigm, we find a broader repertoire of self-organizing circuits than previously recognized, including some which are unexpectedly robust to parameters.

R.; Stella, J.; Ruhi, A.", "abstract": "The increasing frequency and magnitude of climatic extremes are altering water availability in dryland ecosystems globally. However, riparian vulnerability to hydroclimate whiplash remains poorly understood. Here, we examined how riparian trees respond to groundwater fluctuations and drought through their water use patterns and phenology. To this end, we combined time-series analysis of long-term, high-frequency groundwater monitoring and satellite imagery from a drought-prone and relatively pristine watershed in California (Chalone Creek, Pinnacles National Park). We found that trees by intermittent river reaches displayed consistent but depth-limited groundwater reliance, while those at perennial reaches primarily relied on groundwater during the dry season. Machine-learning models revealed that at intermittent sites groundwater depth predominantly controlled vegetation greenness, represented by Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). In contrast, variation in photoperiod length dominated at perennial sites where water was more reliably available. During the severe 2020-2022 drought, all species experienced reduced greenness, but phenological responses differed by flow regime. While the start of season was delayed across all sites, trees at intermittent reaches exhibited substantially earlier end of season during drought, resulting in growing seasons shortened by as much as 28 days. These phenological shifts vastly exceed those documented across aridity classifications in global datasets from satellite observations, ground-based monitoring networks, and experimental precipitation manipulations. Although riparian trees in drylands have been shaped by exposure to drought over evolutionary timescales, our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that ecosystems regularly exposed to hydrological are more resilient to drought. Instead, we show that trees in intermittent systems may be operating close to critical groundwater thresholds, rendering them particularly vulnerable to increasingly long and severe droughts.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Under pathological conditions, activated microglia trigger neurodegeneration by secreting pro-inflammatory molecules such as NO, TNF, IL6 and IL1{beta}. In contrast, microglia also possess a negative feedback mechanism to prevent the excessive inflammation by secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL10. It is reported that activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), one of the non-selective cation channels, suppresses the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial activation. However, the effects of TRPV4 activation on the microglial anti-inflammatory responses remain unknown. In this study, we investigated whether TRPV4 contributes microglial anti-inflammatory responses using primary cultured murine microglia. We found that application of a selective TRPV4 agonist, GSK1016790A, enhanced LPS-induced IL10 release in the microglia, which was fully suppressed by co-application of a selective TRPV4 antagonist, GSK2193874, or absent in cultured microglia derived from TRPV4-knockout (TRPV4-KO) mice. Furthermore, neutralization of extracellular IL10 significantly reversed suppressive effects of GSK1016790A on LPS-induced release of TNF, IL6 and IL1{beta}. Expression pattern of microglial activation markers implied that GSK1016790A shifted microglial activation status to an immunoregulatory phenotype.

Increased red blood cell (RBC) mortality due to complement activation during infections is often considered collateral damage of this defensive role. In this study, we propose that this phenomenon results from the active regulation of RBC mortality by the complement system during acute immune responses. Traditionally, RBC homeostasis has been explained by the need to ensure adequate oxygen delivery. However, RBCs are also critical determinants of blood viscosity, which directly influences tissue perfusion. Efficient immune responses require increased blood flow to infected tissues, but changes in plasma proteins during acute-phase responses can increase blood viscosity, hindering perfusion. We suggest that the complement system selectively removes less elastic RBCs, compensating for the rise in plasma viscosity and optimizing tissue perfusion during infections.

Adipose tissue has been proposed as a potential reservoir for viral persistence and tissue dysfunction contributing to symptomology seen in Long COVID. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from two cohorts: participants with subacute COVID-19 (28-89 days post-infection) compared to pre-pandemic controls, and participants with Long COVID compared to those with those classified as indeterminate based on the RECOVER-Adult Long COVID Research Index (12-47 months post-infection). We found no evidence of persistent SARS-CoV-2 RNA in adipose tissue in any participant. SAT from participants with subacute COVID-19 displayed significant transcriptional remodeling, including depleted immune activation pathways and upregulated Hox genes and integrin interactions, suggesting resident immune cell exhaustion and perturbations in tissue function. However, no consistent changes in gene expression were observed between Long COVID samples and samples from indeterminant participants.

We show NPM1c phase separation is necessary and sufficient to coordinate the recruitment of NUP98 and KMT2A to condensates. Through extensive mutagenesis and pharmacological destabilization of phase separation, we find that NPM1c condensates are necessary for regulating gene expression, promoting in vivo expansion, and maintaining the undifferentiated leukemic state. Finally, we show that nucleoporin and KMT2A fusion proteins form condensates that are biophysically indistinguishable from NPM1c condensates. Together, these data define a new condensate underlying leukemias that we term coordinating bodies (C-bodies), and propose C-bodies as a therapeutic vulnerability.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Additionally, IN administration is the preferred route of entry by users of illicit drugs. Despite the widespread use of the IN route of administration, there is no established paradigm to access this route of administration preclinically to yield precise and reliable control over delivery. This poses major gaps in therapeutic discovery/testing, establishing pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships of therapeutics, and understanding the mechanisms of actions of therapeutics. We developed an in-dwelling microfluidic device, that, when implanted upon the nasal bone, accesses the nasal cavity to allow reliable and precise IN fluid delivery during freely-moving behavior. We validated this device, called the Nasal Access Port (NAP), to confirm it allows rapid and precise control of fluids. We further exemplified the application of the NAP for studying outcomes of IN cocaine in mice, including its pharmacokinetic profile, and both the rapid release of dopamine (DA) and behavioral effects upon IN cocaine.

Fasting elephant seals adjust neuroendocrine function and gene expression to cope with potentially detrimental effects associated with extended fasting. DNA methylation alters gene expression by modulating accessibility to regions necessary to initiate transcription. The role of fasting and glucocorticoids on DNA methylation in elephant seals is understudied. We evaluated whether fasting alters global blood DNA methylation, the potential correlation between increased glucocorticoids and methylation, and the effects of glucocorticoids on DNA methylation in seal muscle cells in primary culture. We found that fasting transiently increases blood DNA methylation and that blood DNA methylation levels correlate with plasma cortisol. Hence, we then conducted bioinformatic analyses to identify regions in the elephant seal glucocorticoid receptor (GR) promoter that influence gene transcription through methylation (CPG islands). We identified one CpG island within the putative promoter region of GR gene. Methylation in this region, however, was unaffected by prolonged fasting. We then investigated whether exogenous glucocorticoids alter DNA methylation and gene expression profiles in seal muscle cells in primary culture (myotubes). Exposure to glucocorticoids for 12 or 48 hours decreased DNA methylation while upregulating pro-survival gene expression in seal myotubes. Our results show that whereas prolonged fasting transiently increases DNA methylation in elephant seal blood, sustained exposure to exogenous glucocorticoids decreases DNA methylation and activates a pro-survival transcriptional program in seal myotubes. Therefore, our results suggest that DNA methylation is a plastic, potentially cell-type-specific response that regulates gene expression in fasting seals.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

High PVC burden can lead to left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, eccentric hypertrophy, and an increased risk of heart failure (HF) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Inadequate angiogenesis is a key determinant in the transition from adaptive to maladaptive cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis is a risk factor for arrhythmia and SCD. To quantitatively assess structural remodeling and transcriptional alterations in PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (PVC-CM), animals were implanted with modified pacemakers to deliver bigeminal PVCs (200-220 ms coupling interval) for 12 weeks. Collagen deposition and interstitial ultrastructure of LV samples were analyzed using light and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. Pericytes, fibroblasts, myocytes, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells were imaged using confocal microscopy, quantified with an artificial intelligence-based segmentation analysis, and compared using hierarchical statistics. Transcriptional changes were assessed via RNAseq. Although cardiomyocytes hypertrophied in PVC-CM, capillary rarefaction was overcome by an increase in capillary-to-myocyte ratio. Additionally, thicker blood vessels were more abundant in PVC-CM. Fibroblast-to-myocyte ratio more than doubled, interstitial collagen fibers increased, and interstitial space thickened in PVC-CM. Transcripts involved in interstitial remodeling, inflammatory response, and alarmins were strongly elevated in PVC-CM. Overall, while the angiogenic response meets the metabolic demands of cardiac hypertrophy, upregulated markers of inflammation and cardiomyopathy linked to reactive fibrosis collectively represent an adverse LV remodeling that heightens the risk of HF and SCD in PVC-CM.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Y.; Walter, J.; Robijns, A.; Kromdijk, J.", "abstract": "In order to prevent damage by excess light, photosystem antennae can switch to an energy dissipative mode (termed non-photochemical quenching, NPQ). In higher plants, this switch is facilitated by the presence of Photosystem II subunit S (PsbS) protein, which was discovered 25 years ago. While the role of PsbS in induction of NPQ was soon found to require protonation of key glutamate residues facing the thylakoid lumen, a complete understanding of how NPQ is subsequently initiated is still lacking. Recent work on Norway spruce suggests that reversible phosphorylation at a few key residues of PsbS may coincide with the induction of a sustained dissipative state. Here we used Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines to assess the functional implications of phosphorylation at threonine-259, one of the implicated phosphorylatable residues. Using a set of residue changes expressed in the background of PsbS knock-out mutant, npq4, we show that neither phosphomimetic, phosphosubstitution, nor phosphonull complementations could rescue NPQ activity to the level of the unperturbed protein. Instead, all residue substitutions at threonine-259 gave rise to significantly impaired induction and accelerated NPQ recovery, while protein accumulation and thylakoid membrane localisation were not affected. We suggest that these results are consistent with a role for the C-terminus in the propensity or stability of hydrophobic interactions between PsbS monomers to form homodimers, or between PsbS and other LHCII proteins to initiate the quenched state.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

(red palm weevil), Plodia interpunctella (Hubner) (Indian meal moth), and Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) (beet armyworm). Laboratory bioassays revealed distinct differences in larval survival and mortality across the species. Neem oil demonstrated high effectiveness against S. exigua larvae, achieving 100% mortality at all tested dietary concentrations, and moderate effectiveness against R. ferrugineus. In contrast, it had no significant effect on P. interpunctella. Boric acid was proved to be universally effective, leading to 100% mortality in all three species at its highest concentration. Gallotannin acid had species-specific effects on S. exigua but had negligible effects on R. ferrugineus and P. interpunctella. These findings highlight the potential of natural, low-toxicity compounds as alternatives to synthetic insecticides. Additionally, this study suggests new frontiers for investigating the role of the gut microbiota in mediating the effectiveness of these compounds.

Similarly, blunted sensitivity to the aversive effects of alcohol facilitates increased drinking. However, the relationship between stress exposure, coping mechanism, and sensitivity to alcohol's aversive effects is unknown. In rats, predator odor stress increases alcohol intake in animals that show persistent avoidance of stress-paired stimuli, termed Avoiders. Here, we tested the hypothesis that Avoider rats have blunted sensitivity to alcohol's aversive effects using an alcohol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm. After a single conditioning session, Non-Avoider rats acquired alcohol-induced CTA while Avoiders did not. Male rats across all groups eventually acquired alcohol CTA after four conditioning sessions. However, in females, only Non-Avoiders acquired alcohol-induced CTA. In male Non-Avoider rats, a single CTA-inducing dose of alcohol increased cFos expression in the lateral habenula (LHb), an important nucleus in aversion signaling. In male Avoiders, the same dose of alcohol decreased LHb cFos expression. cFos expression in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), which provides glutamatergic inputs to the LHb, was also diminished by alcohol in male Avoider rats. In females, alcohol had no effect on cFos cell counts in the LHb. However, in the LH, alcohol diminished cFos expression in female Non-Avoiders. Collectively, these findings suggest that stressed Avoider rats are hyposensitive to alcohol's aversive effects, which may facilitate their heightened alcohol drinking after stress. Sex- and stress group-specific differences in LH and LHb recruitment highlight these regions as candidates for mediating stress-induced changes in alcohol behaviors.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

We therefore investigated how HDL cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. In vitro, we found that HDL bind to, are internalized by, and are transported through human brain endothelial cells via mechanisms involving the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) and the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). Notably, we discovered that LDLR facilitates only the transport of HDL particles containing apolipoprotein E (apoE). In vivo, HDL injected into the bloodstream enter into the brain through brain endothelial cells, and accumulated in medulla, cerebellum, olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cortex. Further investigation in Ldlr-/- mice revealed region-specific changes in HDL accumulation with reduced levels in the medulla and mixture of midbrain/cortex/hippocampus, no change in the olfactory bulb, and increased levels in the cerebellum. Together, these findings provide new insight on the interaction of the lipoprotein metabolism between the periphery and CNS.

Previous research has demonstrated its CeA nociceptive role in migraine, visceral, arthritic, and inflammatory pain murine models. The contribution of CeA CGRP to neuropathic pain is unclear. This study examined the effects of CGRP and its receptor antagonist, CGRP 8-37, in the CeA on mechanical and cold sensitivity in two mouse models of neuropathic pain: chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) mediated by paclitaxel (PTX) and injury-induced neuropathy through the spared nerve injury (SNI) model. Mechanical and cold sensitivity were measured using the hindpaw von Frey and topical acetone drop assays, respectively. Neither CGRP nor CGRP 8-37 in the CeA had any significant effect on mechanical sensitivity in either neuropathic pain model. In the SNI-treated mice, CGRP infusion into either the left or right CeA reduced cold sensitivity in the left and right SNI-treated hindpaw, while CGRP 8-37 infusion into the left or right CeA increased cold sensitivity in the right SNI-treated hindpaw only. In PTX-treated mice, CGRP infusion into the left or right CeA decreased cold sensitivity of the contralateral paw only. These results suggest that CGRP in the CeA influences pain modulation in a complex manner that depends not only on the hemisphere and injury site, but also on the underlying cause of the neuropathic condition.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

The connection between spatial memory and retinal phenotype is poorly investigated. Additionally, the influence of sex on the disease in mouse models is not sufficiently clear and requires further investigation. Aim: To investigate the retina and spatial memory of 5xFAD mouse models of AD by measuring retinal and behavioral parameters. Approach: A custom-built optical coherence tomography (OCT) system is used to image the retina of both eyes of 32 transgenic 5xFAD mice and 32 non-transgenic littermates over the course of 6 months (3-9 months of age) to investigate retinal parameters. The Morris Water Maze (MWM) test was performed to examine correlations between the retinal and spatial memory phenotype of the mouse model. Results: Data were acquired in the form of OCT reflectivity images and OCT angiograms as well as video recordings of the MWM test. Layer thickness and vascular density were calculated from the resulting data. Behavioral data was extracted from the videos acquired from the MWM. Total retinal and inner retinal layer thickness increased slightly over the measurement period, while outer retinal layer and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness showed no significant change. The correlation analysis between MWM and layer thickness data revelated a positive correlation between inner nuclear layer thickness and MWM test day parameters. Conclusions: OCT and MWM data revealed sex-based differences in the retinal phenotype of the 5xFAD mouse model, with changes in retinal thickness in different stages of the study and dissimilar correlations between retinal and spatial memory phenotype.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

While SC signals are widely recognized for isolating extracerebral hemodynamics such as cardiac and respiratory artifacts, no consensus exists on how best to incorporate them into analysis pipelines, limiting comparability across studies. Here, we systematically investigate six SC regression strategies within a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) framework, using fNIRS data acquired from temporal and occipital cortices of 16 healthy adults during naturalistic auditory, visual, and audiovisual passive stimulation. These strategies varied in the number of SCs used, anatomical specificity, and the application of dimensionality reduction. Our results show that for oxygenated hemoglobin signals, processing data without SC regression yields uninterpretable outcomes, with widespread negative beta estimates and no detectable task-related activation, underscoring the crucial role of SC correction. Among correction methods, approaches pooling all SC signals without anatomical constraints consistently outperformed spatially constrained techniques mimicking limited SC availability. Furthermore, applying orthogonalization to the full set of SCs provided additional improvements by efficiently capturing shared systemic variance and reducing redundancy, enhancing detection of modality-specific cortical activations and condition contrasts. Finally, although the deoxygenated hemoglobin signal is inherently less sensitive to systemic noise, it benefited from the same SC regression strategies, supporting their applicability across chromophores. Overall, our findings highlight the essential role of SC regression in recovering physiologically meaningful signals in fNIRS and recommend including all available SC channels within the GLM, coupled with orthogonalization techniques, as a robust and generalizable best practice for denoising across diverse experimental designs and hardware configurations.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Further, gut dysbiosis significantly alters the antiseizure activity of carbamazepine (CBZ) in TMEV-infected mice with acute seizures. Thus, we herein sought to define how experimentally evoked intestinal dysbiosis influences hippocampal pathophysiology and neuroinflammation following acute symptomatic seizures in TMEV-infected mice, and whether acute CBZ treatment could further influence this neuropathology. Mice were pretreated with antibiotics or saline, followed by TMEV infection, and CBZ or vehicle administration (days 3-7 post-infection). Histological analyses were then performed on hippocampal tissue to quantify neuronal death, microgliosis, astrogliosis, and cellular proliferation after acute infection. While overall microglial reactivity did not markedly differ between groups, microglial proliferation was significantly increased in CA1 of CBZ-treated versus VEH-treated intact mice. Dysbiosis appeared to blunt this CBZ-induced microglial proliferation. Further, dysbiosis contributed to neuroprotection while also increasing neural proliferation within CA3, which may worsen disease outcomes due to aberrant migration and integration.

Eosinophil-depleting antibodies have not shown significant improvement in clinical symptoms, which has turned attention to mast cells. These cells also accumulate in the esophagus of EoE at levels that correlate with symptoms, demonstrate extensive activation including degranulation, correlate and remain elevated and poised for reactivation even in EoE patients in remission as defined by reduced eosinophil levels. Herein, we examine a mechanism of mast cell activation in EoE. Methods: Esophageal mast cell degranulation was quantitated by CD63 expression by flow cytometry. Mast cell degranulation activity of esophageal biopsies was examined employing a bioassay with human CD34 progenitor cell derived primary human mast cells. Bulk and single cell RNA sequencing data of the esophagus were analyzed for complement dysregulation and mast cell properties as a function of disease state. Human esophageal biopsies were stained for C3 and analyzed for C3a and C3 protein content. Primary human mast cells and fibroblasts were further interrogated by flow cytometry, immunostaining, and RNA sequencing. Results: Esophageal mast cells demonstrated increased CD63 expression, a measure of degranulation, in subjects with active compared with remission EoE. Esophageal biopsy lysates induced mast cell degranulation. Analysis of esophageal bulk RNA sequencing data demonstrated that the mast cell marker CPA3 strongly correlated with C3AR1. Accordingly, the level of C3a receptor on esophageal mast cells was proportional with CD63 expression. C3AR1 expression was increased in the fibrostenotic endoscopic phenotype compared to normal appearing active EoE patients. Esophageal biopsies were notably enriched in the expression of multiple complement genes (including C3AR1, C3, CFB, C1QA, C1QB, and C1QC) some of which were increased in active vs remission EoE (C3AR1, CFB, C1QA, C1QB, and C1QC). Single cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing data revealed enrichment of C3 in fibroblasts at levels higher in EoE compared with non-EoE controls. The ratio of C3a/C3 protein levels in the esophagus was increased in EoE compared to control. Mast cells and fibroblasts have increased proximity in EoE compared with non-EoE control subjects. Additionally, C3a stimulated mast cells to express increased CD117 and release multiple EoE-relevant cytokines including fibroblast active mediators including granzyme B, which is enriched in esophageal mast cells.

In adults, FoxP1 protein levels are dysregulated in a variety of disorders, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), atherosclerosis, and heart failure, where they causally contribute to disease pathogenesis. Although independent investigators have reported that FoxP1 protein is ubiquitinated, and E3 ligases have been identified for other FoxP family proteins, the identity of the E3 ligase that controls FoxP1 protein stability has remained unknown. Here, we identify FBXO24, a subunit of the Skp-Cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, as the regulator of FoxP1 ubiquitination and stability. Specifically, FBXO24 regulates K48 and K63 ubiquitination, complexes with, and co-localizes to the nucleus with FoxP1 protein in lung epithelial cells. Depleting FBXO24 reverses the unfolded protein response and cell death triggered by loss of FoxP1 protein in lung epithelium, suggesting a protective role. Additionally, FBXO24 knockout mice exhibit elevated FoxP1 levels in the lung and heart and reduced unfolded protein response activity after short-term cigarette smoke exposure. Intriguingly, we also uncovered bidirectional regulation, whereby FoxP1 protein binds to the FBXO24 promoter to suppress FBXO24 transcription. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that a substrate for an E3 ligase can also regulate the E3 ligase and, therefore, control levels of other substrates, revealing new regulatory networks. Targeting FBXO24 may offer a therapeutic strategy for COPD, atherosclerosis, and heart failure by stabilizing FoxP1 levels in the heart and lungs and mitigating harmful downstream effects.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Somatic and germline development are decoupled as pre-dauer starvation induces germline quiescence while the soma continues its development until dauer is formed. A rapid return to germline Notch-dependence and an increase in presentation by the germline stem cell niche of the Notch ligand LAG-2--regulated at the protein and not transcript level--are among the earliest events of dauer recovery.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Spatial variation in bycatch risk was evident: specific marine areas exhibited high natal-origin diversity, reflecting complex dispersal. A. alosa showed extensive medium- and long-distance movements - including rare longitudinal displacements along the Cantabrian slope - and greater natal origin diversity than A. fallax, whose dispersal was largely restricted to middle-distance, latitudinal migrations. In both species, bycatches were dominated by the most abundant continental populations - Mondego and Minho for A. alosa, and Ulla and Minho for A. fallax - suggesting that these rivers function as source populations exporting individuals to sink populations through marine dispersal. Despite their differing dispersal ranges, both species displayed dual resident-dispersive contingents coexisting within the same populations, reflecting an interplay of river proximity, philopatry and resource availability. The stronger philopatry and constrained range of A. fallax imply heightened vulnerability to localized bycatch pressure near natal rivers, whereas A. alosa's broader dispersal and higher origin diversity expose multiple populations to risk at a regional scale. These species-specific dispersal capacities and metapopulation structures critically shape bycatch vulnerability. Incorporating natal-origin and dispersal data into transnational, ecosystem-based management - such as targeted temporal or spatial fishing restrictions at mixing hotspots - will be essential to safeguard metapopulation dynamics, mitigate bycatch mortality, and maintain ecological connectivity among European shad populations.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

However, eDNA surveys are prone to imperfect detection, and non-detections are often misinterpreted as true absences. Despite its critical implications for biodiversity assessments, detection uncertainty remains rarely quantified in eDNA studies. Occupancy modelling provides a powerful tool to address this limitation, yet it remains underused in eDNA applications, in part due to a lack of accessible and flexible tools. To bridge this gap, we developed NeMO (Nested eDNA Metabarcoding Occupancy), a user-friendly R package for fitting multi-species occupancy models in a Bayesian framework. NeMO explicitly accounts for the nested structure of eDNA metabarcoding studies, typically involving multiple replication steps: collecting several eDNA samples per site and running multiple PCR replicates for each sample. It further incorporates sequencing read counts and different PCR pooling strategies. This framework estimates species occupancy, the probability of eDNA collection when present, the probability of eDNA amplification when collected, and the expected sequence read count when amplified. It also enables users to assess how environmental or methodological covariates affect these probabilities. Importantly, NeMO helps estimate the minimum number of eDNA samples, PCR replicates, and sequencing depth needed to confidently confirm species absence, offering a retrospective tool to evaluate and optimise study design. We demonstrate its utility using a published fish biodiversity dataset from the Rhone River (France). NeMO integrates key modelling features into a single streamlined framework, making it broadly accessible for researchers and practitioners, to rigorously assess detectability and optimise resource allocation in eDNA metabarcoding surveys. Our results highlight the importance of quantifying detection uncertainty, with significant implications for monitoring elusive species and for guiding robust, cost-effective eDNA sampling strategies.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

V.; Ribeiro, E. D.; Benson, R.; Verd, B.", "abstract": "Vertebrae arise from somites, transient embryonic segments that rhythmically bud from the presomitic mesoderm during axial elongation. The number and identity of vertebrae are ultimately determined by somitogenesis and subsequent anterior-posterior regionalisation, largely governed by hox gene expression. Interspecific variation in vertebral count and regionalisation therefore reflects evolutionary changes in somite number and homeotic identity following species divergence. While many macroevolutionary studies have examined homeotic and non-homeotic changes in the vertebral column, few have explored these dynamics in teleosts, despite their exceptional species richness. Using African cichlids as a model, we show that shifts in vertebral regionalisation can arise through modifications to anterior-posterior patterning, but that much of the observed variation is driven by changes in somite number, with homeotic effects emerging largely as a by-product of somitic changes. Moreover, low intraspecific variation in vertebral count, lacking phylogenetic structure, suggests that somitic count variation within species is strongly canalised and has remained consistent throughout the diversification of African cichlids. In addition, we find no correlation between intraspecific variation in vertebral counts and mean vertebral counts, and this variation does not consistently scale with body aspect ratio among individuals. Therefore, intraspecific variation is decoupled from both macroevolutionary patterns of vertebral count evolution and body shape diversification. Together, our findings highlight the dynamic interplay between somitogenesis and homeotic transformations in shaping vertebral diversity and underscore the value of cichlids as a model for understanding the developmental basis of axial evolution in teleosts.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Several recent studies have identified such architectures (e.g., chromosomal rearrangements and supergenes) contributing to adaptation or divergence across diverse species, from plants to mammals. Specifically, within Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), genomic studies are revealing large haplotypes and structural variants that may underpin local adaptation in the species. Using data from >4000 individuals from 134 locations spanning the North Atlantic Ocean, we identify a large (~3-Mbp) genomic region on Ssa18 showing patterns of differentiation and linkage disequilibrium indicative of a large haplotype block containing three divergent haplotypes (herein A, B, and C haplotypes). In Europe, haplotypes A and B were common, whereas A and C were more common within North America, suggesting a shared \"ancestral\" A haplotype, with different continent-specific alternative haplotypes. Data support independent origins of divergent haplotypes in each continent, as well as signals of trans-oceanic introgression of haplotypes. Haplotype frequency is strongly associated with latitude, climate, and life history (smolt age); however, the strength and direction of these relationships vary across continents. Overall analyses were consistent with other studies that identify chromosomal rearrangements; however, long read sequence data could not confirm evidence of a structural variant, although an ancestral fusion polymorphism may explain the formation and maintenance of the observed haplotypes.

In resistant crop varieties, plant immunity can be triggered by immune receptors that recognize these effectors. Resistant crop varieties are grown in large-scale monocultures imposing strong selection pressure on pathogens, driving rapid evolution of effector repertoires resulting in the frequent breakdowns of resistance within just a few growing seasons. The oomycete Peronospora effusa, responsible for downy mildew on spinach, is an example of a rapidly adapting pathogen, but it is yet unknown how P. effusa can successfully overcome resistance of spinach by genomic adaptations.\n\nResultsTo close this knowledge gap, we here generated genome assemblies and constructed a pangenome graph for 19 isolates corresponding to 19 officially denominated resistance-breaking P. effusa races, which can cause disease on a differential set of spinach cultivars. Haplotype-resolved pangenome graph analyses revealed that many isolates emerged from recent sexual recombination, yet others evolved via prolonged asexual reproduction and loss of heterozygosity. By phasing effector candidates to determine their allelic variation, we identified effector candidates associated to resistance breaking of spinach varieties and reconstructed the evolutionary events that led to their diversification.\n\nConclusionsThe here developed and applied computational genomics approaches offer unparalleled insights into the molecular mechanisms of the rapid evolution of P. effusa, and points to potential targets for future resistance breading.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Combined with a single-shot data-independent acquisition (DIA) MS workflow, this approach enabled us to consistently quantify ~6,200 proteins from a single Xenopus tropicalis embryo, representing the deepest proteomic coverage of early X. tropicalis development reported to date. Investigation of the temporal proteomes across five cleavage stages (1- to 16-cell) revealed a drastic proteomic shift between 2- and 4-cell stages, followed by more gradual transitions thereafter. Spatial analysis of dissected 8-cell blastomeres uncovered pronounced molecular asymmetry along the animal-vegetal axis, while dorsal-ventral differences were minimal.

In this study we investigate the role of replication stress response on centromere inheritance. We define changes in centromere-associated proteins that govern stability of centromeric and canonical nucleosomes through proximity labeling coupled with affinity purification mass spectrometry. We identified that under replication stress, CENP-A-containing chromatin strongly enriches for SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling proteins ATRX. We show that depletion of ATRX and its associated histone H3.3 chaperone DAXX results in the loss CENP-A retention in S-phase and loss persists into the subsequent cell cycle.

Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-aCMs) provide a valuable tool to study AF pathophysiology by facilitating in vitro modeling. Objectives: To investigate the effects of an intermittent tachypacing protocol (ITPP) in matured hiPSC-aCMs co-cultured with human atrial cardiac fibroblast (haCF) to mimic AF-associated electroanatomical phenotypes. Methods and Results: hiPSC-aCMs were cultured alone or co-cultured with haCFs at 90/10 and 70/30 ratios. ITPP was applied through field stimulation, and optical mapping assessed action potentials (APs) and calcium transients (CaTs). Immunostaining was performed to quantify pro-fibrotic biomarkers (Collagen III and TGF{beta}1). ITPP led to increased spontaneous AP frequency ({Delta}=+31{+/-}7%, P<0.0001) and reduced AP duration at 80% repolarization (APD80%; {Delta}=-15{+/-}4%, P=0.001). Additionally, the upstroke slope ({Delta}=-41{+/-}11%, P=0.001) and amplitude (dF/F0; {Delta}=-51{+/-}13%, P<0.001) of intracellular CaT were significantly reduced. Co-culture at the 70/30 hiPSC-aCM/haCF ratio, showed a >100-fold increase in Collagen III expression (P<0.0001), diminished excitability ({Delta}Hz=-61{+/-}6%, P<0.0001), prolonged {Delta}APD80% ({Delta}=+130{+/-}10%, P<0.0001), prolonged AP triangulation ({Delta}APDTri=+143{+/-}13%, P<0.0001), reduced upstroke slope ({Delta}=-66{+/-}6%, P<0.0001), conduction block ({Delta}=-52{+/-}18%, P=0.0260), and diminished intracellular calcium handling (upstroke slope {Delta}=-50{+/-}8%, P<0.0001;dF/F0=-34{+/-}9%, P=0.0003). Finally, the application of ITPP to the 70/30 co-culture model recapitulated an AF-mediated phenotype ({Delta}Hz=+25{+/-}8%, P=0.02; {Delta}APD80%=-16{+/-}6%, P=0.01) while introducing conduction block ({Delta}CV100/0 vs 70/30= -27{+/-}15 %; P=0.0005).

We investigated changes in finger independence following a ring finger fatigue protocol. We assumed that with fatigue, the ability to actively transmit forces across fingers through neural pathways will be reduced but force transmission passively through mechanical pathways will remain unaffected. Participants performed isometric finger contractions and flexion-extension movements at baseline and following a ring finger fatigue protocol. At baseline, involuntary ring finger forces ranged from 7.3-16.5% MVC. Consistent with our predictions, involuntary ring finger forces decreased by 2.5-8.9% MVC following fatigue.

To address this, we introduce the Event-Related Spatio-Spectral Perturbation (ERSSP) framework, which quantifies spatially distributed time-frequency responses. ERSSP summarizes the number of channels exhibiting significant spectral perturbations, capturing diffuse cortical dynamics from sensor-space EEG. We validated this approach using a passive auditory habituation task in individuals with Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), a condition marked by disrupted thalamocortical modulation. ERSSP revealed enhanced spatial extent of power increases (but not phase-locking) in FXS compared to controls. Results also showed expected gender differences, further supporting biological sensitivity of ERSSP. ERSSP provides a conceptually simple and computationally efficient method for quantifying broadly distributed sensory modulation and may enable new insights into thalamocortical function in both basic and clinical neuroscience.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Metacognitive ability is often measured through modeling the relationship between confidence reports and choice behavior in tasks where performance can be objectively measured. Previous work has explored whether metacognitive ability is conserved across different types of tasks, and across different domains such as perception and memory. However, it is unclear whether approaches to the assessment of metacognitive ability that have worked in these contexts can be extended to value-based decision-making where objective accuracy cannot be evaluated. Here, we compare metacognitive ability across different tasks spanning perception and valuation, using Bayesian hierarchical estimation of the parameters of a computational process model of confidence. This model captures metacognitive ability as the uncertainty of an individual's own decision uncertainty, and can do so in the space of any decision variable, regardless of whether it indexes external features or internal, subjective states. We find that metacognitive ability can be reliably estimated in both objective and subjective decision-making tasks, and is relatively well conserved across tasks, especially within domains and similar confidence reporting paradigms.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

The strong link between the extent of fibrosis and adverse clinical outcomes has led to growing interest in ECM targeted therapies to prevent or reverse maladaptive cardiac remodeling in ICM; yet, the precise composition of the ECM in ICM remains poorly defined. In this study, we employed a sequential protein extraction enabled by the photocleavable surfactant Azo to enrich ECM proteins from left ventricular tissues of patients with end-stage ICM (n=16) and nonfailing donor hearts (n=16). High-resolution mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics identified and quantified over 6,000 unique protein groups, including 315 ECM proteins. We discovered significant upregulation of key ECM components, particularly glycoproteins, proteoglycans, collagens, and ECM regulators. Notably, LOXL1, FBLN1, and VCAN were among the most differentially expressed. Functional enrichment analyses revealed enhanced TGF{beta} signaling, integrin-mediated adhesion, and complement activation in ICM tissues, suggesting a feedback loop driving continued ECM deposition in the end-stage failing heart.

We benchmark iLR on in silico datasets demonstrating comparable performance to the state-of-the-art at single-cell classification using only a fraction of the genes. We test iLR on its ability to distinguish neuronal cell subtypes in healthy vs. autism spectrum disorder patients and find it achieves high accuracy with small sets of disease-relevant genes. We apply iLR to investigate immunotherapeutic effects in cell types from different tumor microenvironments and find that iLR infers informative genes that translate across organs and even species (mouse-to-human) comparison.

T.", "abstract": "Cells invariably encounter unpredictable changes in their microenvironment and undergo adaptation by orchestrating considerable alterations in their molecular states that often result in appreciable phenotypic changes. The timescale of molecular and, therefore, cellular adaptation depends on how quickly the memory of past environmental encounters is lost (and therefore forgotten) by the cell (e.g., degradation rate of proteins unfavorable to the current environment). Here, we study the dynamical implications of two distinct memory mechanisms on cellular responses to a changing environment. The two phenomenological models considered are - 1) Undated memory, wherein each prior environmental exposure has an equal probability to dissipate in the next time step, and 2) Dated memory, wherein each experience is dated and erased according to its order of encounter. We observed that while dated memory leads to faster adaptation in single-step environmental perturbations and helps in quick recovery of cellular benefit, the optimal memory type in the periodic environment depends on the period and cell memory capacity. However, both memory types confer comparable cellular benefits in stochastic environments. We extend the results with these memory types to show how the cost incurred during cellular adaptation (e.g., energetic cost of mRNA and protein production) improves cellular decision-making by delaying the phenotypic response until enough environmental change is experienced by the cells. However, such delayed adaptation proves detrimental to the cells under one-step environmental perturbations. Together, these results elucidate the intricate roles of memory and adaptation cost in phenotypic adaptation in fluctuating environments.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Yet, cumulative evidence increasingly supports a more systemic, full-body view on this incurable disorder, with the liver and kidneys playing an important role in amyloid clearance. The latter is likely potentiated by caloric restriction (CR), but its impact on the metabolism of key amyloid-handling tissues is poorly understood. Methods: We examined the sex-specific effects of amyloidosis and CR on oxidative and metabolic processes in APPPS1 mice, expressing mutant amyloidogenic proteins under the neuronal Thy-1 promoter. Wild-type (WT) and APPPS1 mice were either fed ad libitum (AL) or received 70% of their individual AL intake (CR regimen). Results: Compared to age-matched WT controls, the brain, liver, and kidney of 9-month-old AL APPPS1 mice exhibited higher levels of oxidative stress markers along with altered activity of antioxidant enzymes, including higher superoxide dismutase and lower catalase activity. These differences were sex- and tissue-specific, with kidneys showing the largest AD-induced differences between sexes. As for key glycolytic enzymes, APPPS1 mice possessed higher activity of pyruvate kinase than WT mice in all organs and higher hexokinase and phosphofructokinase activities in the brain, with stronger effects observed in males. CR intensified oxidative stress in the liver and the female brain but reduced it in the female kidney. Moreover, it potentiated glycolysis predominantly in females and modulated glutathione-dependent enzymes in a sex-dependent manner. Conclusions: Neuron-driven amyloidosis induces strong and significant metabolic changes in the entire body, encompassing ubiquitous oxidative damage, enhancement of glycolysis, and antioxidant defense. The lower activity of glycolytic enzymes in the female brain and decreased antioxidant defense in the female liver and kidney provide yet another facet to the complex picture of female vulnerability in AD. Females seemed to profit more from CR, but the general CR effect was not very strong.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

We investigated coevolution and its genomic basis in the dulotic ant parasite Temnothorax americanus and its host T. longispinosus across a broad climatic gradient using population genomics, genome-wide association and transcriptome analyses. Population genomics revealed a striking contrast: panmictic host populations versus structured parasite populations, consistent with geographic mosaic dynamics. Genomic responses to parasite prevalence were strongly asymmetric: hosts showed strong selection on immune and structural defence genes, potentially with pleiotropic social functions. Parasites exhibited weaker signals, often in regulatory genes linked to behavioural shifts critical for raiding. Both species displayed shared genomic signatures of climate adaptation (e.g., desiccation resistance, stress response), suggesting convergent physiological responses. Genes associated with host-parasite encounters (mechanosensation, circadian rhythms, venom) also showed parallel selection. Behavioural traits such as aggression showed limited genomic signals but potentially higher transcriptional plasticity. Associations with chemical traits revealed shared selection on genes involved in cuticular hydrocarbon biosynthesis and chemosensory perception, indicating evolutionary coupling of signal production and perception. Constitutive gene expression patterns diverged: host expression correlated with parasite prevalence, while parasite expression was more strongly linked to climate, reflecting contrasting regulatory pressures.

J.", "abstract": "Juvenile traumatic brain injury (jTBI) is associated with persistent social impairments, particularly when injury occurs early in development. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is especially vulnerable to injury due to its late maturation and location, and developmental disruptions during key phases such as synaptic pruning or myelination may result in long-term behavioral deficits. This study investigated how the age at injury and biological sex influenced the development of social behavior and frontal cortical plasticity. Using a controlled cortical impact model of a bilateral medial PFC (mPFC) injury, we compared injuries sustained on postnatal day (PND) 17 or 28--approximating toddlerhood and middle childhood, respectively. Social behaviors were assessed longitudinally during pre-puberty, puberty, and young adulthood. Play behavior, sociability, social memory, social dominance, and aggression were evaluated, and morphological analyses examined dendritic complexity in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and mPFC using Golgi-Cox staining, and myelin integrity across the mPFC-OFC-amygdala circuit using Luxol-fast blue staining. We hypothesized that PND 17 injuries would result in greater social deficits and increased aggression compared to PND 28 injuries and shams, with males showing more severe impairments than females. Results partially supported these predictions. While jTBI had no effect on general play engagement, it did alter play initiation: PND 28 injury increased play initiation in both sexes, while PND 17 TBI injury delayed normal play development in females. Injuries had no significant impact on sociability or social memory. However, PND 28 injury increased social dominance and aggression in adulthood, with sex moderating these effects. Specifically, PND 17 injury decreased aggression in males and increased it in females. Childhood play behaviors predicted adult aggression, particularly in PND 28-injured animals, and these relationships were moderated by injury and sex. Despite the behavioral findings, histological analyses revealed no significant group differences in dendritic complexity or myelination, though effect sizes suggested decreased dendritic arborization and increased myelin in PND 28-injured animals. These findings highlight age- and sex-dependent vulnerability in the development of social behavior following jTBI. Contrary to expectations, early injury had more pronounced effects in females, while later injury was more detrimental for males. The divergence in behavioral outcomes despite limited histological differences suggests complex, possibly circuit-specific, mechanisms underlying these effects. This study underscores the importance of considering both sex and developmental timing in jTBI research and supports the need for longitudinal models to capture evolving behavioral trajectories.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Similar antibodies are expected to bind the same epitope on an antigen, but how this similarity should be quantified is unclear. Here, we utilized a large body of publicly available data to identify features that are most informative in predicting if two antibodies are likely to bind to the same epitope. We examined features such as pairwise sequence identities, CDR structural similarity, and geometrical similarity of antibody paratopes. We found that, for antibodies with high overall sequence similarity, the CDR sequence identity alone is sufficient to predict if a pair of antibodies binds to the same epitope. Strikingly, the sequence identity of CDR1 and CDR2 had as much or more predictive power than CDR3, which is commonly thought of as the main determinant of antibody specificity. In addition, for antibody pairs with lower overall sequence identity, including structural information led to significant improvements in predictive performance. Guided by these results, we developed BCRMatch (https://github.com/IEDB/BCRMatch) which uses an ensemble machine-learning approach to predict if pairs of antibodies target the same epitope based on antibody sequence alone.

Experimental determination of the effects of all possible mutations or those observed in pathogenic individuals is infeasible. While existing state-of-the-art tools such as AlphaMissense show promise, their performance remains insufficient for diagnostic applications, they are often challenging to run locally. To address these limitations, we developed pLM-SAV, a simple yet effective predictor leveraging protein language models (pLMs). Our method computes delta-embeddings by subtracting the embedding of the mutant sequence from that of the wild type sequence. These delta-embedding vectors serve as input for a convolutional neural network used for training and prediction. To prevent data leakage, we trained our model on a well-characterized, labeled set of Eff10k and evaluated it on a non-homologous subset of ClinVar data. Our results demonstrate that this approach performs exceptionally well on the Eff10k test folds and reasonably on ClinVar test sets. Notably, pLM-SAV excels in resolving ambiguous predictions by AlphaMissense. We also found that an ensemble method, REVEL, outperforms both AlphaMissense and pLM-SAV, thus, we integrated these REVEL-enhanced predictions into our widely used AlphaMissense web application, https://alphamissens.hegelab.org.

Halophytes like Chenopodium quinoa tolerate high soil salinity, but the mechanisms governing guard cell responses to salinity stress in relation to the associated epidermal bladder cells (EBCs) remain unknown. In this study, responses of C. quinoa guard cells under salinity stress and external ABA application were analyzed using RNA profiling and voltage-clamp-based electrophysiology. Under salt stress, guard cell RNA profiles reported the activation of ABA synthesis and signaling pathways. However, unlike EBCs, guard cells became transcriptionally insensitive to ABA. Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that under high Na+ concentrations, guard cells' activity of K+ uptake channels remained unaffected, while they were impaired in ABA-induced activation of anion channels. As a consequence of a unique guard cell ABA response in salt-adapted plants, stomatal transpiration was reduced and CO2 sensitivity enhanced. We propose that under salt stress, C. quinoa guard cells rewire their hormone signaling to switch from an ABA-sensitive to an ABA-insensitive mode. This adaptation may reflect the halophyte's ability to perceive salinity as a non-stressful condition, allowing efficient water usage and sustained growth in saline environments.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

However, it remains obscure whether mitochondrial abnormities are sufficient to drive ALS development. Here, we show that selective depletion of reactive oxygen species modulator 1 (ROMO1), an inner mitochondrial membrane-delimited protein, in cholinergic neurons leads to adult-onset, progressive locomotor deficits in mice that closely resemble ALS pathology. ROMO1 ablation in cholinergic neurons induces ALS-like neuromuscular degeneration, as evidenced by age-dependent motor neuron loss, axon degeneration, disrupted cholinergic transmission, neuromuscular junction denervation, and the resultant muscle atrophy. Notably, ROMO1 loss induces early and progressive mitochondrial cristae deformation in motor neurons, preceding the onset of ALS-like syndromes. Our findings support that mitochondrial impairment in vulnerable motor neurons is a sufficient contributor to ALS etiology, positioning mitochondria as a potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Instead, metabolic dysfunction and the inability of neural cells to support their energetic demands may be a more plausible trigger for subsequent pathological cascade (the neuron energy crisis hypothesis). Here we highlight how type 2 diabetes (T2D) can contribute to neurodegeneration by impairing brain energy metabolism. We present a game-theoretic framework, where neurons face trade-offs between energy efficiency and information fidelity. We show that under metabolic stress, neural networks can evolve toward smaller group sizes that prioritize energy efficiency over information quality, which may underlie the observed collapse of cognitive capacity during neurodegeneration. We conclude with a discussion of interventions, ranging from antidiabetic drugs to cognitive engagement and sensory stimulation, aimed at reducing metabolic stress and preserving cognitive function.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "The medial nucleus accumbens shell (medNAcSh) is increasingly recognized as a key node in the regulation of hedonic feeding, exerting strong control over reward consumption through its projections to downstream structures. Recent studies showed that one of the primary cellular mediators of these effects are dopamine 1 receptor positive striatal projection neurons (D1-SPNs). Specifically, population D1-SPN activity gets inhibited during reward consumption and such inhibition is necessary and sufficient to authorize reward consumption, independent of metabolic need. Anatomically, the medNAcSh spans a 1.5 mm distance along the rostro-caudal axis in mice and previous studies have reported functional gradients along this axis in behavioral control. For instance, classical pharmacological studies have suggested that rostral rather than caudal medNAcSh regulates appetitive behavior. However, the cellular, circuit, and molecular mechanisms underlying this topographical gradient remain unknown. Here we hypothesized that D1-SPNs contribute to this gradient by regulating hedonic feeding via a specific hotspot in the rostral medNAcSh. Using population level calcium monitoring with fiber photometry in mice, we show that rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs demonstrate inhibitory responses during reward consumption, while caudal D1-SPNs do not. Consistently, optogenetic stimulation of rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs inhibits consumption, while stimulation of caudal D1-SPNs had minimal effects, confirming the existence of a functional rostro-caudal gradient. Importantly, we observed no differences between rostral and caudal D1-SPNs in their behavioral or activity responses to aversive stimuli, suggesting that the D1-SPN gradient is specific to appetitive contexts. To investigate potential molecular correlates of this functional gradient, we leveraged open-source anatomy datasets and performed fluorescent in situ hybridization, identifying Stard5 and Peg10 as markers enriched in the rostral and caudal medNAcSh, respectively. Finally, we developed a novel Stard5-Flp driver mouse line, which allowed us to target the rostral hotspot selectively. We demonstrated that Stard5+ neurons recapitulate activity patterns of rostral medNAcSh D1-SPNs. Together, these findings establish a spatially confined rostral subregion of the medNAcSh as a critical regulator of reward consumption and introduce Stard5 as a molecular tool for its manipulation - offering new opportunities for intervention in dysregulated eating beyond classical homeostatic circuits.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Conventional behavioral tests, such as the Basso mouse scale (BMS), rely on qualitative observations, which do not detect subtle yet significant functional deficits. To perform unbiased and quantitative evaluation of motor function and posture after SCI, we employed high-speed video tracking with machine learning-based whole body pose estimation and weight-bearing analyses using the Blackbox system in freely moving mice. We found enduring alterations in posture induced by SCI not captured by conventional metrics. Postural deficits included reduced hindpaw spacing with concomitant increased forepaw spacing, narrowed femur width, and altered hind paw angles, which remained evident beyond 42 days post-injury (dpi). Furthermore, sustained deficits in locomotor activity were identified as decreased distance traveled, decreased exploratory behavior, and disrupted fore-to-hindpaw speed ratio. Additionally, we analyzed behavioral motifs using Keypoint MoSeq software and found frequency changes in unique motor syllables correlating with forward acceleration and turning after SCI. Interestingly, while motor deficits persisted, sensory deficits, such as thermal and mechanical sensitivity, returned to baseline levels by 21 days after injury in C57Bl/6J mice, with no subsequent hypersensitivity. Lastly, we developed a web-based application to assist in visualization and analyses of Blackbox-based kinematic data. Altogether, our study identifies distinct postural and motor deficits pre- and post-SCI using accurate, unbiased, and quantitative behavioral assessments. By tracking the unique features of motor recovery trajectories, researchers can more accurately assess the effectiveness of SCI therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

It is now apparent that macrophages can be trained to become better at attacking infections. Although trained immunity is thought to result from metabolic and epigenetic reprogramming, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear.

ATP ligates the canonical Purinergic Receptor 2 subtype X7 receptor (P2X7) to mediate endosomal Two-pore domain Weak Inwardly rectifying K+ channel 2 (TWIK2) translocation into the plasma membrane (PM). This endows the cells to transit to a  ready state for microbial killing in two directions: first, K+ efflux via PM-TWIK2 induces NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which further activates metabolic pathways; second, upon bacterial phagocytosis, PM-TWIK2 internalizes into phagosome membrane with proper topological orientation, where TWIK2 mediates K+ influx into phagosomes to control pH and ionic strength favoring bacterial killing. Therefore, the enhanced association of TWIK2 in phagosomal and plasma membranes signaled by danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as ATP, mediates trained immunity in AM{phi} and enhances the microbiocidal activity.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

RSPO3/WNT signaling from the capsule specifies definitive zone (DZ) progenitors from the adrenal primordium, which then differentiate into a cortisol-producing transitional zone and an androgen-producing fetal zone under the influence of RSPO3 and ACTH. Loss of NR0B1 impairs DZ specification and triggers direct adrenal primordium-to-fetal zone conversion, mirroring the mechanism of X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita. When DZ cells are encapsulated with capsule cells separately derived from pluripotent stem cells, they reconstitute zonation in vivo, forming ACTH-responsive tissue that produces both cortisol and androgens. This organoid platform offers a powerful tool to dissect human adrenal development and establishes a foundation for regenerative therapies targeting adrenal diseases.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

While Allee effects that reduce gamete encounters and fertilisation success may lead to reproductive and recruitment failure, the critical population densities and distances between individuals required to maintain viable populations remains uncertain. Here, we investigate the links between colony isolation and fertilisation patterns using an experimentally manipulated patch of the broadcast spawning tabular coral, Acropora hyacinthus. Corals were arranged in a clustered radial design, with colonies arranged at increasing distances radiating downstream from a central spawning aggregation. Fertilisation and paternity assignment analyses were used to examine the influence of parental distance, current alignment, colony size, and genetic relatedness. Fertilisation success declined sharply with increasing distance among corals, and paternity assignments indicated most parents were located within 3 m of each other, underscoring the importance of colony proximity. Additionally, fertilisation success was highest for colonies positioned downstream of the central cluster, and 84% of sequenced progeny were sired by colonies located directly upstream. Simulations of natural reef spatial population distributions projected onto a virtual grid, incorporating empirically derived parentage distances, indicated that populations remained well-mixed at typical adult densities in nearby reefs. However, as densities decreased to 1 colony per 100 m-2 (i.e. 0.01 coloniesm-2), reproductive isolation and the formation of patchy breeding units became prevalent. Overall, our findings highlight that the spatial arrangement and isolation of corals on reefs, and subsequent Allee effects on fertilisation, can jeopardise the reproductive success of broadcast spawning corals.

S.; Albornoz, F.; Gervers, K. A.; Busby, P. E.; Jones, F. A.", "abstract": "Plants of the same species can harbor shared enemies, resulting in indirect, intraspecific competition. When this competition is strong, there are fitness costs associated with growing near a same-species individual, termed Conspecific Negative Density Dependence (CNDD). Host-specific microbial pathogens are known mediators of this type of indirect, intraspecific plant competition, yet how these plant-microbe interactions vary with environmental context is less explored. Further, microbial pathogens and mutualists may jointly contribute to the relative strength of intraspecific competition, yet most studies focus only on pathogens. We use ITS metabarcoding to characterize soil and foliar fungal functional groups associated with individual trees of three dominant conifers in forests where the strength of CNDD is known to be greater at lower elevations relative to higher elevations. We hypothesize that plants found in the mesic low elevation forests accumulate more host-specific fungal pathogens compared to plants found in the more xeric high elevation forests. Conversely, we hypothesize that plants found in the high elevation forests accumulate more host-specific mutualists compared to those found at low elevations. We test these hypotheses by evaluating three metrics of plant-associated fungal functional groups, alpha diversity, relative abundance, and host specificity, that together address the degree to which a plant recruits particular groups. We find the diversity, relative abundance and host specificity of soil fungal pathogens to decrease with elevation. In contrast, we find ectomycorrhizal fungal host specificity, but not diversity or relative abundance, to increase with elevation. Aboveground, we find a key foliar pathogen Nothophaeocryptocus gaeumanii to support our hypotheses as a dominant, and highly host specific pathogen that is enriched at low elevation sites. Our results indicate that across a climate gradient known to negatively covary with CNDD strength, soil pathogens recruitment is most prevalent in the mesic climates and, to a lesser extent, ectomycorrhizal recruitment is most prevalent in the xeric climates. Together these findings suggest that both pathogenic and mutualistic fungal symbionts could contribute to landscape level variation in competitive, intraspecific plant interactions.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

In this process, ancestral female C. elegans acquired genetic modifications that enabled self-sperm generation, self-sperm activation, and a reduced reliance on sexual reproduction. However, how males have adapted during this transition from dioecy to androdioecy is less explored. Using respective Caenorhabditis species, we demonstrated that androdioecious hermaphrodites exhibit a reduction in sex pheromone potency, while androdioecious males show notably heightened olfactory habituation and diminished mate exploration capabilities. The behavior of androdioecious males can be reverted to resemble that of dioecious males by replacing the SRD-1 receptor with its dioecious orthologs. This intrinsic characteristic is contingent upon the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. We propose a theoretical framework where C. elegans males have accumulated genetic variations in their pheromone receptor, leading to altered chemosensory perception of the opposite sex, which confer a selective advantage that favors the establishment of hermaphroditism. Our study provides insights into an overlooked male trait that was shaped by changes in chemosensory signaling. The findings underscore the capacity of chemosensory variations to influence how organisms perceive critical ecological factors and eventually facilitate the emergence and stabilization of hermaphroditism.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Utilizing one-year-old male and female 5xFAD mice that constitutively express human APP and PSEN1 transgenes with five AD-linked mutations, we measured the lumbar IVDs extracellular matrix composition, the three-dimensional structure, degenerative score via histopathology, and mechanical behavior. The collagen, glycosaminoglycans, and advanced glycation end-products content of the IVD were not appreciably different between the 5xFAD animals and their wild-type littermates. Likewise, the 5xFAD IVDs were not histopathologically degenerated. However, the IVD volume, measured by contrast-enhanced microCT, was larger in the 5xFAD animals. Furthermore, dynamic microcompression revealed that 5xFAD IVDs exhibited higher loss tangent, indicating altered tissue damping and fluid-flow dynamics within the disc. These results suggest that although the IVDs of mice with AD are not more degenerated, they may be more susceptible to damage accumulation due to the elevated absorption of energy. Elderly individuals with AD may thus be more susceptible to IVD injuries that lead to eventual degeneration and spinal pain.

A basement membrane layer forms between the epithelium and the collagen, expressing basement membrane proteins. Invasive breast cancer cell lines are introduced into the breast duct to simulate ductal carcinoma. We observe two distinct lateral migration regimes that depend on the initial number of cancer cells within the duct. Additionally, the morphology of the breast duct and the invasion distance varies between the two regimes. Furthermore, we examine the effects of two widely used chemotherapies, Doxorubicin and Paclitaxel, on the invasion behavior of breast cancer cells within this model. The introduction of these drugs alters the invasion patterns of cancer cells, with Paclitaxel inhibiting invasion in 30% of tests.

The spectral separation power of 2D NMR spectroscopy circumvents the need for physical isolation or workup of the mixture components in the two samples. Using quantitative 1D 1H NMR, it is validated that the HSQC0 approach effectively removes all the undermining effects that plague quantification in common 2D NMR experiments, including differential attenuation due to relaxation in the two phases, pulse imperfections, partial decoupling, off-resonance effects, and incomplete coherence transfer in the case of scalar coupling variation.

Using GBM cell lines with DEPDC1 knockdown, we observed markedly reduced proliferation and motility. Notably, DEPDC1 downregulation significantly enhanced radiosensitivity, as demonstrated by increased radiation-induced apoptosis, G2/M phase arrest, DNA damage, and impaired DNA repair post-radiation, resulting in lower survival rates in clonogenic assays.

Utilizing IMPACH, results revealed that loss of epigenetic regulators-particularly ARID1A-enhances transcriptomic and epigenetic heterogeneity under controlled conditions. ARID1A deficiency promotes stochastic chromatin opening and induces an atypical gene expression program associated with poor clinical outcomes. Despite increased epigenetic randomness, chromatin changes remain localized to regulatory elements, partially linked to SMARCA4 binding sites.

Thus, owing to its scalability and versatility, IMPACH provides a robust framework for elucidating how epigenetic perturbations shape cellular heterogeneity in cancer.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

V.; Downs, C.; Heyduk, K.", "abstract": "Premise: Plant species face a myriad of challenges including climate change and habitat destruction. On Oahu in Hawaii, Scaevola taccada L., a coastal dune shrub, is highly impacted by human activities, but is also experiencing environmental threats like sea level rise. Despite its ubiquity across Pacific islands, the extent and distribution of genetic diversity in this species is unclear. Further, it is currently unclear how many times S. taccada arrived on Oahu. Methods: We surveyed population genomic diversity using ddRAD-seq in eight populations of S. taccada on Oahu. Using principal components and STRUCTURE analyses, we assessed whether genetic diversity was structured geographically across the island. Additionally, we generated whole genome sequences from five herbarium accessions and used a publicly available genome to construct a haplotype network to infer the number of times S. taccada arrived on Oahu. We analyzed climate data and leaf thickness measurements to understand how patterns of genetic diversity were correlated with environmental and trait variation. Results: Our analyses pointed to a trend in which two populations in protected areas were both genetically differentiated from, and harbored less genetic diversity than, human dominated areas. Further analysis of genetic structure via a PCA and pairwise FST indicated a secondary geographic pattern in our dataset by which western beach populations were differentiated from eastern beach populations. The chloroplast haplotype network suggested a single arrival on Oahu. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that S. taccada populations in protected natural areas harbored unique genetic variation compared to human dominated beach parks, but that protected populations also had significantly reduced genetic variation compared to other populations.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

S.; Mattern, H.; Liu, P.; Noelle, J.; Kuehn, E.", "abstract": "Tactile fingertip sensations are critical for everyday life. Accordingly, tactile fingertip maps have been extensively studied in human primary somatosensory cortex. However, the fine-grained functional architecture of these maps remains largely unknown. To uncover this architecture, we sought to estimate 2D spatio-tactile population receptive fields (pRFs) of the tip of the index finger in human Brodmann area 3b (BA3b). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging at 7T and submillimeter resolution along with prospective motion correction, we recorded brain responses whilst participants sensed a row of vibrotactile pins sweeping along cardinal axes over a portion of the fingertip. To estimate pRF position and size, we initially fit a 2D Gaussian pRF model to the data, which, however, produced largely implausible pRF estimates. Simulations indicated that this likely occurred because the size of pRFs in BA3b surpasses the portion of the fingertip we stimulated, resulting in an incomplete mapping of pRFs. To address this issue, we constrained the fitting procedure and refined the 2D Gaussian pRF model by keeping pRF size constant. Our results for pRF position then revealed that the ulnar-to-radial axis spanning the fingertip maps onto a superior-to-inferior axis in BA3b. Both the putatively large pRF size (relative to the mapping area) and the pRF position gradient we uncover here appear compatible with receptive field properties quantified in monkeys. Our study provides the first comprehensive investigation into the fine-grained functional architecture of human fingertip maps and brings us one step closer to a thorough understanding thereof.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

To bridge the gap between single-cell sequencing and proteomic methods, we developed an innovative single-cell multiomics methodology, termed TIP-seq, which facilitates the simultaneous profiling of the transcriptome and intracellular proteins without prior cell manipulation. In TIP-seq, microfluidic technology is leveraged to integrate oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies with hydrogel beads, allowing for the capture of mRNAs and proteins from individual cells within droplets, thereby enabling high-throughput and precise dual-omics data acquisition. When applied to lung cell lines and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues, TIP-seq analysis revealed notable cellular heterogeneity and molecular dynamics, emphasizing the distinct immune cell interactions within NSCLC tissues. Key immune checkpoint interactions in NSCLC, such as SPP1-CD44, NECTIN2-TIGIT, and NECTIN2-CTLA4, along with functional alterations in tumor-associated dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells, were identified via TIP-seq, underscoring their pivotal roles in mediating immune suppression within the tumor microenvironment.

Testing for APD compliance of wireless devices requires experimental and numerical body models or phantoms that conservatively reproduce the absorption characteristics of human skin. Previous studies of APD indicate that frequency-dependent impedance-matching effects are caused by the low-permittivity stratum corneum (SC) layer. The objective of this study is to complement previous work (Christ et al., 2020) and to develop dispersive dielectric models to represent reflection and absorption of electromagnetic fields at the surface of the skin across a frequency range up to 110 GHz. The reflection coefficient of the skin of human volunteers was measured at frequencies of 15 to 43 GHz with open waveguide probes, complementing previous data from 45 to 110 GHz (Christ et al., 2020). The volunteers represented both sexes and different age groups and occupations; measurements were made at various regions of the body. The statistical analysis of the results show that the reflection coefficient follows a normal distribution in regions where the SC is relatively thin, which permits development of a conservative skin model that covers the 95th percentile of the tested population. As expected, in regions where the SC is thicker, e.g., the palms, the reflection coefficient is not normally distributed, because the thickness of the SC depends on the mechanical stress and friction to which the hands are exposed during routine daily activities. There was no evidence of relevant differences due to sex, but there is evidence for a slight age-dependent difference. The measured data, via fitting to the numerical model, allow the derivation of two-layer dielectric dispersive models that represent absorption and reflection at the surface of the skin with known uncertainty. The proposed models can be used to conservatively demonstrate compliance with the APD limits of wireless devices operating at frequencies of up to 110 GHz in any of the 5G and 6G bands defined.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Current surgical treatments often fall short of clinical expectations due to poor biocompatibility, suboptimal mechanical properties, and frequent post-surgical fibrosis. Tissue engineering, however, offers promising alternatives by using biocompatible scaffolds that mimic the native tendon structure. This study aimed to develop an advanced tendon-like bundle replicating the microarchitecture and mechanical strength of native tendons. The scaffold was constructed from aligned electrospun poly-lactic acid (PLA) microfibers and designed to function as a drug delivery system for Rolipram, an antifibrotic agent. To improve cell-scaffold interactions, the scaffolds were coated with type-I collagen, a primary component of the tendon extracellular matrix (ECM). Morphological analyses confirmed the successful fabrication of smooth, well-aligned, bead-free fibers with controlled diameters, closely resembling the natural orientation and dimensions of tendon collagen fibers. Drug release was monitored for both uncoated and collagen-coated electrospun mats, with no burst release observed. Histological analysis demonstrated effective cellular infiltration by human tenocytes, with cells distributed throughout the scaffold after 14 days in culture. These results underscore the potential of tendon-like scaffolds as a promising platform for tendon repair, setting the stage for further optimization.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Traditional high-throughput screening methods typically rely on 2D {beta}-cell cultures, but such cultures do not mimic the 3D organisation and cell-to-cell communication of {beta}-cells in pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Existing 3D {beta}-cell culture models are hindered by high costs, technical complexity, and limited compatibility with high-throughput screening platforms. In this work, we developed an approach for generating 19 homogeneously shaped pancreatic {beta}-cell spheroids in each well of a 96-well plate, using micropatterned polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogels and MIN6 insulinoma cells. The uniform shape and positioning of the individual spheroids enabled the simultaneous, real-time imaging of Ca2+ signals in up to 1824 independent spheroids in response to glucose and various test compounds. Using this approach, we show that increasing glucose causes concentration-dependent Ca2+ oscillations in individual spheroids, that these Ca2+ oscillations are sensitive to modulators of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, and that the frequency of Ca2+ oscillations correlate with insulin secretion. Finally, we demonstrate that the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulphate, an agonist of the cation channel TRPM3, increases the frequency of glucose-induced Ca2+ oscillations and enhances insulin release; the TRPM3 antagonist isosakuranetin inhibited these responses. In conclusion, we established a cost-effective and scalable 3D {beta}-cell platform for high-throughput screening of insulin release-modifying compounds, with potential applications in drug development and personalized medicine for the management of diabetes mellitus.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Traditionally, experimental methods for affinity measurement have been time-consuming and expensive. With the realm of Artificial Intelligence, in silico medicine has revolutionized; recent developments in machine learning, particularly the use of large language models (LLMs) for representing antibodies, have opened up new avenues for AI-based designing and improving affinity prediction. Herein, we present an advanced antibody-antigen binding affinity prediction model (LlamaAffinity), leveraging an open-source Llama 3 backbone and antibody sequence data employed from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) database. The proposed approach significantly improved over existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches (AntiFormer, AntiBERTa, AntiBERTy) across multiple evaluation metrics.

Combination therapy with chemotherapeutic agents along with targeted therapy are the most common methods of treatment used in the terminal stages of the disease. Eventual development of resistance to these approaches, leading to fatal outcomes suggests the presence or emergence of a heterogenous population of cells intrinsically resistant to commonly used regimens. Previous work identified a heterogeneous population of metastatic tumor cells with distinct molecular characteristics driven by Macc1 (Metastasis Associated in Colon Cancer 1) overexpression, which could be targeted by lovastatin (transcriptional inhibitor of Macc1). Building on this foundation, the efficacy of lovastatin in targeting metastatic cells with high Macc1 expression was evaluated in lung metastasis, and the regulatory pathways governing Macc1 expression and lovastatin treatment in mBC were investigated. The expression of Macc1, in breast cancer biopsies provides insights into the intra and inter tumor heterogeneity of the Macc1 gene and its correlation with disease outcomes. While some studies suggest synergistic effects between statins and chemotherapeutic agents, comprehensive evaluations of various combinations and their therapeutic outcomes are still needed. The therapeutic efficacy of lovastatin combined with chemotherapy to determine the most effective treatment regimen that maximizes tumor cell ablation demonstrated that lovastatin can effectively ablate the chemoresistant tumor cells in mBC. The translational implications of this research will identify patient subgroups that may benefit most from statin-chemotherapy combinations that could support the repurposing of statins as cost-effective adjuvant therapies for mBC.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is a major cereal crop, but suffers significant yield losses due to pathogen attack every year. Here we use an untargeted metabolomic approach to assess the diversity and shifts in key barley metabolites produced in response to Pyrenophora teres f. teres infection, a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen and causal agent of net blotch disease. Tryptophan-derived compounds, including tryptamine, serotonin, and a novel indole alkaloid, 2-oxo-tryptamine (2OT), were among the most significantly induced and abundant compounds, with mass spectrometry imaging revealing that these metabolites accumulate at the site of infection. A transcriptomic approach identified a flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO), which was functionally characterized as a 2-oxo-tryptamine synthase (2OTS). In addition, a cytochrome P450 (CYP71P10) was characterized as a tryptamine-5-hydroxylase, responsible for serotonin biosynthesis. These characterized genes are tightly co-expressed with genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis and signify a major metabolic flux towards indolic compounds after infection, potentially serving as bioactive phytoalexins. Additional microbial interactions using a biotrophic fungus (Blumeria hordei; powdery mildew), a hemibiotrophic bacterium (Pseudomonas syringae), and alternative cultivars suggest that these pathways represent a generally activated resistance response in barley.

From the stochastic system, we derive a corresponding nonlinear population model with both local and global supercoiling states, demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits a unique, globally stable equilibrium point, and identify key parameters through sensitivity analysis. We further extend the model by considering the temperature sensitive gyrase mutant E. coli strain nalA43 and illustrate how shifting the gyrase topoisomerase balance via temperature acts as an effective control knob on the population, from which we derive a control law.

Despite histologic remission, molecular and structural changes in the epithelium persist, contributing to ongoing symptoms and relapse. The transcription factor FOXM1 has been shown to be a key regulator of epithelial proliferation and inflammation in allergic asthma. Objective: To investigate the role of FOXM1 in epithelial disruption in EoE and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of FOXM1 inhibition. Design: FOXM1 expression was analyzed in human esophageal biopsies, patient-derived organoids, and murine EoE models. IL-13 stimulation was used to model EoE in vitro. The effects of FOXM1 inhibition via the small molecule RCM-1 and siRNA-mediated knockdown were assessed by histology, gene expression profiling, organoid formation rates, and barrier integrity assays. RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to elucidate molecular mechanisms. Results: FOXM1 was significantly upregulated in patients with active EoE and localized to the basal epithelium. IL-13 increased FOXM1 expression, which impaired epithelial differentiation and enhanced basal cell hyperplasia. FOXM1 inhibition restored differentiation markers, reduced basal hyperplasia, and improved barrier function. In murine models, RCM-1 ameliorated epithelial changes and decreased eosinophil infiltration. Mechanistically, FOXM1 directly regulated cell cycle gene, CCNB1, which was upregulated in EoE and downregulated upon FOXM1 inhibition. FOXM1 expression was driven by an IL-13-PI3K/AKT axis. Conclusion: FOXM1 plays a pivotal role in epithelial disruption in EoE by driving proliferation and impairing differentiation. Targeting FOXM1 restores epithelial homeostasis, mitigates inflammation, and offers a novel therapeutic approach for EoE.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

We identified a surprising and essential NSP12 binding site within the RNA sequence encoding the conserved Y1 domain of NSP3, which regulates RNA abundance upstream of the site.

Here, we systematically tested methods of sampling eDNA at the air-water interface, showing for the first time that aquatic life can be reliably detected from passive air samples collected nearby. We deployed four simple air samplers, three different kinds of filters and one open tray of deionized water, alongside paired water samples and visual counts over a six-week peak run of Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) at a local spawning stream. We then quantified eDNA concentrations in both air and water (air: copies/day/cm2; water: copies/L) using quantitative PCR, to estimate (1) the concentration of target eDNA in air vs. water, and (2) the capture performance of each filter type. Despite an approximate 22,000-times dilution versus water, passive air collectors captured quantitative eDNA signals that closely paralleled salmon counts, although recovery varied with sampler design and orientation. We show the air-water interface is a quantifiable source of aquatic genetic information using simple, passive samplers that do not require electricity, making them appealing for biomonitoring in remote or resource-limited settings.

We then correlated allele states of common variable SNPs to gene expression to identify hundreds of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), many of which emerged specifically upon IFN treatment. We characterized the distinct but overlapping neuronal transcriptional responses to IFNa and IFNg, and identified specific response QTLs. Functional annotation of STAT1 binding to the genome in response to IFN stimulus identified STAT1 binding sites as enriched for response-regulating human genetic variation and also enabled identification of loci with IFN-dependent allele-specific binding of STAT1. These results demonstrate how human genetic variation can influence IFN-dependent mechanisms in neurons in disease-relevant ways.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

The mutant HD protein inhibits non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity, leading to the accumulation of DSBs. DSBs promote transcriptional pathology in mice that cannot expand their CAG tracts somatically. Conversely, Inhibition of DSBs reverses neuronal toxicity in animals that undergo somatic expansion.

In Botryllus schlosseri, this agametic process, termed peribranchial budding, generates new zooids in a stereotyped, cyclical manner from a cluster of cells of the peribranchial epithelium. Despite detailed morphological characterization, the molecular and cellular underpinnings of budding initiation remain poorly understood. Here, we present the first single-cell transcriptomic atlas of B. schlosseri peribranchial budding, encompassing multiple stages from pre-budding to near-mature zooid. This high-resolution atlas captures the diversity of cell types involved in budding and their dynamics enabling precise cluster annotation and lineage trajectory inference. While circulating mesenchymal cells exhibit transcriptional hallmarks of stem-like states, we found no evidence of broad contribution to bud onset and morphogenesis beyond hematopoietic and gonadal lineages. Instead, we identified a distinct founder cell population arising from peribranchial epithelium, marked by a unique transcriptional profile and progressive acquisition of developmental potency. This supports a model in which budding is initiated by dedifferentiation of committed epithelial cells rather than activation of multi- or pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, we highlight signaling pathways, including GNRHR-like receptors, that may couple metabolic state with developmental progression. Altogether, our data suggest that peribranchial budding in B. schlosseri is driven by potential reprogramming within epithelial tissues. This work provides a foundational resource for studying non-embryonic development and the evolution of regenerative strategies in chordates.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

To contrast adaptive genetic variation across geography, we quantified population variation in tolerance traits and their thermal plasticity for five populations of Drosophila melanogaster from a 3000-km latitudinal gradient across east coast Australia, with eight populations from an environmentally heterogeneous 600x300km area within Victoria. Surprisingly, population variation in stress tolerance within Victoria was comparable to that across latitude. Consistent with local adaptation, heat and desiccation tolerance were greater for populations from warmer and drier environments, and populations from more predictable environments showed greater thermal plasticity. Adaptation to environmental heterogeneity at smaller geographic scales can therefore contribute more to adaptive capacity than originally thought. However, patterns of adaptation often changed across geography and treatments, which makes predicting responses to global change challenging.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

In this study, using custom-designed, multi-probe microarrays and pooled RNA sequencing experiments in patient samples of Plasmodium falciparum, we identified disease-specific sense and Natural Antisense Transcripts (NATs) encoded by the mitochondrial genome, along with those encoded in the nucleus and targeted to the parasite mitochondria. These findings span two clinical manifestations of severe malaria - hepatic dysfunction (HD) and cerebral malaria (CM). Although mitochondrial activity is known to be reduced in blood-stage malaria, upregulation of genes linked to the TCA cycle in the CM cluster indicates disrupted mitochondrial bioenergetics which might contribute to severe disease pathogenesis. Profiling of sense and antisense mitochondrial transcripts reveal a striking correlated expression of sense-antisense transcript pairs in both the disease manifestations, indicating a potential regulatory role of NATs in mitochondrial function. This study provides direct evidence for the origin of NATs from the mitochondrial genome. It further provides a dynamic gene regulation profile of key sense and antisense transcripts responsible for mitochondrial translation and bioenergetics. We propose these differentially regulated NATs against protein-coding genes specific to the observed disease severity as potential novel targets to disrupt key mitochondrial functions of the parasite.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

However, current discovery efforts remain largely confined to experimental screening, while in silico rational design of MGs persists as a formidable challenge. A critical step toward rational design lies in accurate ternary complex modeling. Given the scarcity of such complexes in the Protein Data Bank for training specialized predictive models, we tested the ability of recently developed co-folding models, including AlphaFold 3, Boltz-1, Chai-1, Protenix, and RoseTTAFold All-Atom in building the complex models. We systematically curated a dataset, named MG-PDB, with 221 non-covalent MG-engaged ternary complexes. MGBench were further introduced as a comprehensive benchmark set, which comprises 88 ternary structures excluded from co-folding models' training data through rigorous time-based partitioning. Our benchmark results demonstrated that AlphaFold3 achieved the best overall performance among co-folding methods, in terms of both protein-protein interaction interface prediction (50.6% success rate) and MG-protein interaction recovery (32.9% success rate). However, our homology study showed that most of their successful predictions actually stemmed from memorization. Further analysis revealed three phenomena of current co-folding methods for MG ternary structure prediction. Firstly, these methods struggle to accurately model large interaction interfaces. Secondly, their predictive accuracy is notably reduced for domain-domain complexes compared to domain-motif interactions. Lastly, they face specific challenges in modeling MG degrader complexes with sufficient accuracy. We showcased they relied on the existing interaction patterns, and highlighted the need for further improved in novel E3 ligase systems.

However, accurately identifying these \"key tuning\" residues remains challenging. In this study, we present an information-theoretic approach, inspired from signal processing methods, to identify key residues in protein sequences. We propose a feature selection framework that integrates both unsupervised and supervised approaches, using Shannon entropy and mutual information as initial priors, respectively. A key aspect of our method is the use of Cramer's V and Thiel's U to decouple coevolved residues. The supervised approach employed mutual information to assess residue relationships, followed by evolutionary decoupling with Cramer's V to better decouple individual contributions. This two-step process demonstrated statistically significant improvement compared to DeepSequence, a leading tool (p-value=0.0149). The unsupervised approach, based solely on Shannon entropy prior to decoupling, showed competitive performance despite a slightly lower statistical significance (pvalue=0.14). Although the supervised method yields higher accuracy given sufficient training data, the unsupervised technique is simpler, requiring only a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) that can be obtained via BLAST. When applied to a system with well-characterised structural information, specifically nanobody-antigen interactions, our methods not only effectively identified the binding residues but also accurately reconstructed a contiguous binding surface, surpassing current state-of-the-art computational tools. Collectively, our methods provide a flexible and interpretable solution for various protein engineering applications.

Our data reveals novel oncogenic functionality for the two hotspots N546K and K656E, linked to evasion of lysosomal degradation.

Two major H9N2 lineages dominate globally: the G1 lineage (genotype G1-B), prevalent in the Middle East, Africa and the Indian subcontinent, and the BJ/94 lineage (predominantly genotype G57), dominant in China, Vietnam, South Korea, Indonesia, and the Far East. We investigated replication, transmission, and pathogenicity of representatives of these two lineages, linking genotype to phenotype. The G57 strain A/Ck/Vietnam/H7F-14-BN4-315/2014 (Vietnam/315) was more lethal to chicken embryos than the G1-B strain A/chicken/Pakistan/UDL-01/2008 (Pakistan/UDL-01). Vietnam/315 exhibited higher replication in both directly infected and contact chickens, with increased virus shedding from the oropharynx and cloaca. In contrast, Pakistan/UDL-01 virus was primarily shed from the oropharynx, highlighting differences in replication, tissue tropism and transmission. Gene analysis showed the M gene of Vietnam/315 enhanced replication in primary chicken kidney cells, whereas the PB2, HA, NA, and M genes promoted increased replication in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells. Both viruses showed preferential binding to avian-like receptors over human-like receptors. However, Vietnam/315, however, exhibited higher neuraminidase activity and a more acid-stable HA (pH fusion 5.2) than Pakistan/UDL-01 virus. These findings suggest G57 genotype viruses possess greater replication and transmission fitness than G1-B viruses in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro. Reassortment events involving G1-B strains acquiring G57 genes may enhance replication and virulence, potentially increasing the risk of animal and human infection.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Microorganisms are active in the cold, snow-covered Arctic tundra soils; however, their contribution to the greenhouse gas budget during the Arctic winter remains poorly understood. To investigate the functional activity of bacterial and archaeal communities in oroarctic tundra soils during late winter, metatranscriptomic samples were collected alongside greenhouse gas flux measurements across key vegetation types, which represent pH and moisture gradients. The transcription of central carbohydrate metabolism genes, various stress-related genes, and high CO2 fluxes evidenced active microbial metabolism in winter. Vegetation type, soil C/N ratio, pH, and water content explained the functional activity and microbial community composition during winter. The transcription of functional marker genes for methane oxidation and denitrification, coupled with flux data, suggests that shrublands and meadows act as CH4 sinks in winter, while all vegetation types function as small N2O sources. Our results further demonstrate that the soil microbial community has a significant impact on wintertime GHG emissions in the oroarctic tundra, thereby enhancing the explanatory power of a statistical model beyond that of abiotic environmental variables alone. This represents a promising step toward developing microbial-mediated models, which are crucial for improving predictions of ecosystem responses to climate change.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of six heavy metals on two types of E. coli was determined using the broth microdilution method. Heavy metal resistance genes were detected via PCR amplification, and the gene structures were analyzed through whole genome sequencing. The findings indicated that ESBL-producing E. coli strains exhibited significantly higher levels of resistance to Cu, Zn, and Cd compared to non-ESBL-producing strains. Additionally, ESBL-producing strains harbored various plasmid-mediated heavy metal resistance genes. The results of WGS demonstrated that ESBL-producing strains carried plasmids encoding 148 heavy metal resistance genes, and the resistance to certain antibiotics (e.g., chloramphenicol) in E. coli exhibited a significantly negative correlation with resistance to specific heavy metals, including Mn and Cd (p < 0.05). The present study hypothesizes the presence of synergistic mechanisms between heavy metal resistance and antibiotic resistance in ESBL-producing E. coli, including the dual functionality of the efflux pumping system, the synergistic regulation of the pressure response system, and the physical barrier effect of biofilm formation. The experimental findings revealed the link between heavy metals and antibiotic resistance, highlighting the importance of environmental monitoring and control of heavy metal pollution.

This study aimed to characterize the oral microbiome of healthy individuals and evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial properties of two PRF formulations. The antibacterial activity, along with its temporal dynamics at different initial bacterial concentrations, was assessed against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Porphyromonas gingivalis) and Gram-positive bacteria exhibiting diverse morphologies (Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus lentus, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Streptococcus mutans). Our results fill gaps in knowledge concerning the spectrum of PRF's antimicrobial activity, demonstrating efficacy against a range of opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria. Key findings include the absence of significant differences in oral microbiome composition between male and female participants, a lack of inhibitory effect of A-PRF against S. mutans, and a transient inhibitory effect against P. gingivalis observed only at low initial OD and within 24 hours.

This method outperformed two traditional isolation techniques in terms of performance, time, and overall cost-efficiency. We present Induced Droplet Ovalisation (IDO): a droplet-based protocol that combines single-cell encapsulation with automated image analysis.

This approach significantly reduces the time and resources required to study proteolytic consortia, offering an automated, easy-to-implement, and label-free alternative to conventional screening. Our device achieves high-throughput screening (HTS) at 0.2 kHz while significantly reducing the cultivation medium volume used compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, in-droplet microbial recovery is enhanced by two orders of magnitude, enabling the enumeration of significantly more colonies compared to traditional screenings.

We built a genome-wide single guide RNA (sgRNA) library in the industrial methanotroph, Methylococcus capsulatus, consisting of ~45,000 unique sgRNAs mediating inducible, CRISPRi-dependent transcriptional repression. A selective screen during growth on CH4 identified 233 genes whose transcription repression resulted in a fitness defect and repression of 13 genes associated with a fitness advantage. Enrichment analysis of the 233 putative essential genes linked many of the encoded proteins with critical cellular processes like ribosome biosynthesis, translation, transcription, and other central biosynthetic metabolism, highlighting the utility of CRISPRi for functional genetic screening in methanotrophs, including the identification of novel essential genes. M. capsulatus growth was inhibited when the CRISPRi system was used to individually target genes identified in the screen, validating their essentiality for methanotrophic growth. Collectively, our results show that the CRISPRi system and sgRNA library developed here can be used for facile gene-function analyses and genomic screening to identify novel genetic determinants of methanotrophy.

Bd reproduces via a multistage asexual pathway. The Bd life cycle begins with a motile zoospore. Upon contact with a surface, the zoospore anchors itself and forms a cyst. The cyst then develops into a germling that produces rhizoid structures. Finally, the germling matures into a zoosporangium which then releases multiple new zoospores. In this study, we investigated the effects of nutrients on the growth and differentiation of Bd. The presence of carbohydrates, vitamins, and trace minerals had a negligible effect on Bds ability to progress through its life cycle. In contrast, the amino acids L-leucine and L-isoleucine (and to a lesser extent L-arginine) were required for cysts to germinate into germlings. However, none of these amino acids were able to sustain further cellular development. Furthermore, the presence of nitrate or ammonium aided progression from germlings into immature zoosporangia that were not able to produce zoospores. The progression to mature zoosporangia was blocked by nitrite or the combined action of calcium ions and bicarbonate. The addition of soluble and insoluble protein sources alone also allowed Bd to develop into immature zoosporangia and affected the rate of development. Finally, protein sources in combination with L-amino acids allowed the completion of the Bd cycle by allowing development from zoospores to mature zoosporangia that were able to release new zoospores.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

We further showed that exudates from both Alteromonas and Prochlorococcus were responsible for this effect. Unidentified toxic exudates of Prochlorococcus lowered the carrying capacity of Pro99 medium for axenic Prochlorococcus cells, whereas heat-labile high-molecular weight exudates of Alteromonas both removed the effect of Prochlorococcus exudates and extended the lifespan of axenic Prochlorococcus cultures. Alteromonas exudates contained a wide variety of proteins and demonstrated enzymatic activities. Some of these proteins and activities may have been packaged within extracellular membrane vesicles, which we identified within Alteromonas exudates and found capable of physically associating with Prochlorococcus cells. Many of the functionalities observed in Alteromonas exudates (e.g., increasing phosphate availability, degrading hydrogen peroxide) were consistent with leaky Black Queen processes, which are defined as services provided by one organism that benefit the entire community and favor the evolution of interdependencies in microbial communities.

Among pathogens colonizing the CF lung, Pseudomonas aeruginosa is predominant, infecting over 50% of adults with CF, and becoming antibiotic-resistant over time. Current therapies for CF, while providing tremendous benefits, fail to eliminate persistent bacterial infections, chronic inflammation, and irreversible lung damage, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies. Our group engineered mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC EVs) to carry the microRNA let-7b-5p as a dual anti-infective and anti-inflammatory treatment. MSC EVs are low-immunogenicity platforms with innate antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties, while let-7b-5p reduces biofilm formation and inflammation. In a preclinical CF mice model, we reported that let-7b-5p-loaded MSC EVs reduced P. aeruginosa burden, immune cells, and proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. We hypothesize four complementary mechanisms for the observed in-vivo effects of the let-7b-5p loaded MSC EVs: antimicrobial activity, anti-inflammatory properties, inhibition of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa biofilm formation in CF airways, and stimulation of anti-inflammatory macrophage behaviors. This study focused on the second and third mechanisms and demonstrates that MSC EVs engineered to contain let-7b-5p effectively blocked the formation of antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa biofilms on primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pHBECs) while also reducing P. aeruginosa-induced inflammation. This approach holds promise for improving outcomes for people with CF.

L.; Lee, J. S.; Worledge, C. S.; Colgan, S. P.; Kao, D. J.", "abstract": "Antibiotic tolerance and persistence contribute to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, yet strategies to reverse these phenotypes remain limited. Our previous work revealed that the naturally occurring nucleoside adenosine can reverse antibiotic tolerance in diverse bacterial strains by modulating cellular energetics. Here, we define the mechanism underlying this potentiation, identifying adenosine metabolism as a driver of cytoplasmic alkalinization and proton motive force (PMF) generation. Using RNA sequencing, metabolite assays, and pH-sensitive fluorescent reporters, we show that adenosine is catabolized by purine nucleoside phosphorylase (deoD) to yield ribose-1-phosphate, which enters the pentose phosphate pathway. This metabolic flux stimulates the electron transport chain, leading to proton translocation, increased cytoplasmic pH, and enhanced PMF. Disruption of key metabolic enzymes (deoD, deoB, tktAB) or inhibition of enolase abolishes both alkalinization and antibiotic sensitization. Using a respiratory-deficient mutant, we demonstrate that aerobic respiration is the primary driver of alkalinization and gentamicin potentiation, though adenosine can partially increase membrane potential independently of oxidative phosphorylation. These findings support a model in which adenosine metabolism promotes aminoglycoside uptake via PMF-driven transport, sensitizing tolerant bacteria to killing. Our work implicates the ribose moiety of adenosine as a key metabolic lever for reversing tolerance. Broader exploration of nucleoside-based adjuvants across bacterial species and antibiotic classes may reveal generalizable strategies to enhance antibiotic efficacy against recalcitrant infections.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we revisit this question using one of the deepest metagenomic sequencing efforts to date, applying 148 Gbp of Nanopore long-read and 122 Gbp of Illumina short-read data to a single forest soil sample. Results. Our hybrid assembly reconstructed 837 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 466 high- and medium-quality genomes, nearly all lacking close relatives among cultivated taxa. Rarefaction and k-mer analyses reveal that, even at this depth, we capture only a fraction of the extant diversity: nonparametric models project that over 10 Tbp would be required to approach saturation. These findings offer a quantitative, technology-enabled update to long-standing diversity estimates and demonstrate that conventional metagenomic sequencing efforts likely miss the majority of microbial and biosynthetic potential in soil. We further identify over 11,000 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), >99% of which have no match in current databases, underscoring the breadth of unexplored metabolic capacity. Conclusions.

In this study, we present high-resolution crystallographic data revealing two distinct dimerization patterns of HSA (PDB ID: 9V61), obtained under high-concentration crystallization conditions, in addition to results from dipyridamole dockings.

Interface surface area distribution and space group histograms further support the rarity and potential physiological relevance of the identified dimer forms. Importantly, these dimer configurations do not disrupt Sudlows drug-binding sites, which is important as the dipyridamole docking analysis presents strong affinity to Sudlow site I and Sudlow site III, not affecting their utility in engineered drug delivery.

Drylands, covering nearly 45% of Earth's land surface, contribute significantly to net primary production (NPP) and influence the interannual variability of the terrestrial C sink. However, the controls on plant litter decomposition, a major pathway of C release, remain unclear in these ecosystems. Here, we present a global analysis of plant litter decomposition in drylands, using a dataset from 116 sites across five continents spanning diverse climates and ecosystems. We found that litter decomposition does not correlate with mean annual precipitation (MAP) at the global scale, challenging the paradigm that water availability is the primary constraint on ecological processes in drylands. Instead, our analysis identifies mean annual temperature (MAT), precipitation-temperature synchrony, precipitation variability, and cloud cover frequency as key drivers. Specifically, our model predicted faster decomposition rates for warmer and more monsoonal ecosystems, but vary independently of MAP. Additionally, decomposition correlated positively with both lignin and nitrogen content, in contrast to the negative lignin-decomposition relationship commonly observed in mesic ecosystems. These findings suggest a fundamental mismatch between aridity and its expected effects on decomposition rates in terrestrial ecosystems. Given the ongoing expansion of drylands, rising temperatures and changes in precipitation variability under climate change; our results underscore the need to refine decomposition models beyond traditional aridity frameworks.

We performed whole-genome sequencing on ~70,000 surviving reproductive individuals and directly observed rapid and repeatable adaptation across climates. Allele frequency changes over time were parallel in experimental evolution replicates within the same climates, while they diverged across contrasting climates--with some allele frequency shifts best explained by strong selection between -46% to +60%. Screening the genome for signals of rapid climate adaptation identified a polygenic architecture with both known and novel adaptive genetic variants connected to important ecological phenotypes including environmental stress responses, CAM5 and HEAT SHOCK FACTORs, and germination and spring flowering timing, CYTOCHROME P450s and TSF. We found evolutionary adaptation trends were often predictable, but variable across environments.

Here we investigate the mechanism underlying this phenomenon by calling mtDNA sequence, abundance, and heteroplasmic variation in human blood using whole genome sequences from ~750,000 individuals. Our analyses reveal a simple, two-step mechanism: first, individual cells randomly accumulate low levels of \"cryptic\" mtDNA mutations; then, when a cell clone proliferates, the cryptic mtDNA variants are carried as passenger mutations and become detectable in whole blood. Four lines of evidence support this model: (1) the mutational spectrum of age-accumulating mtDNA variants is consistent with a well-established model of mtDNA replication errors, (2) these mutations are found primarily at low levels of heteroplasmy and do not show evidence of positive selection, (3) high mtDNA mutation burden tends to co-occur in samples harboring somatic driver mutations for clonal hematopoiesis (CH), and (4) nuclear GWAS reveals that germline variants predisposing to CH (such as those near TERT, TCL1A, and SMC4) also increase mtDNA mutation burden. We propose that the high copy number and high mutation rate of mtDNA make it a particularly sensitive blood-based marker of CH.

Specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes and genetic ancestry are linked to slow disease progression of Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) infections in macaques. To maximize their utility for HIV/AIDS research, the Southwest National Primate Research Center (SNPRC) has introduced targeted breeding strategies to reduce the prevalence of SIV-refractory MHC haplotypes and levels of admixture between Indian- and Chinese-origin macaques. Results: We characterized the MHC region in SNPRC macaques by targeted deep sequencing of 1,458 animals born over a ten-year period. Following the implementation of MHC management strategies, the prevalence of SIV-refractory MHC haplotypes reduced significantly while overall haplotype diversity was maintained. We investigated the impact of management strategies on admixture, population genetic structure, genetic diversity and inbreeding using whole exome sequencing of founding and colony-born animals (n=488). Admixture analysis of founders showed some Chinese ancestry, though population substructure more closely reflected primate research center source than geographical origin. The levels of Chinese ancestry declined significantly over time, though genetic diversity remains high. Finally, we performed genome-wide scans for genetic selection over time. We identify numerous genomic regions where allele frequencies have shifted significantly, supporting the presence of short-term adaptation within the colony. Conclusions: We show that colony management strategies have been successful without reducing genetic diversity of the MHC or exonic regions. We also show that colony genetic substructure is related to animal colony source and that mergers and migrations have reduced inbreeding and increased overall genetic diversity.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Thin, porous collagen type I membranes were fabricated and characterized by linear close contact profilometry to determine their thickness, which closely approximated the in vivo intestinal basement membrane. Caco-2 cells cultured within the device exhibited the formation of villi-like structures, tight junction formation, and mucin production, demonstrating successful differentiation and functional barrier formation on the collagen membrane. We investigated the device capacity to model host-pathogen interactions by infecting the cell layer with Candida albicans. Confocal microscopy revealed hyphal invasion of the epithelial cells, and permeability assays demonstrated increased layer permeability following infection, highlighting the device ability to replicate infection processes and their impact on barrier integrity. This gut-on-chip, by integrating physiological membrane and replicating key structural and functional aspects of the intestine, offers a promising platform for studying intestinal physiology and host-pathogen dynamics.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

In this study, we identify VCAN, a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan, as a novel transcriptional target of ERK5 and a central mediator of ERK5-related oncogenesis. Through a combination of genetic (silencing, overexpression) and pharmacological approaches, applied in both a chemically induced murine sarcoma model and several human STS cell lines, we demonstrate that ERK5 positively regulates VCAN expression. Functionally, VCAN silencing (by shRNAs) recapitulates the phenotypes of ERK5 silencing, including impaired migration, adhesion, proliferation, and tumorigenesis. Conversely, VCAN overexpression rescues these effects, confirming its essential role in ERK5-mediated oncogenesis. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiling reveals that VCAN accounts for a substantial portion of ERK5-regulated gene expression program. Analyses of human STS patient samples reveal significantly elevated mRNA levels of both VCAN and ERK5 compared to normal tissues. Notably, a strong correlation between VCAN and ERK5 expression, both at mRNA and protein levels, emerged in biopsies from leiomyosarcomas and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas. Together, these findings uncover VCAN as a key effector in ERK5-driven tumorigenesis and highlight the ERK5/VCAN signaling axis as a promising therapeutic target in soft tissue sarcomas.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated improved outcomes when MRSA sepsis is treated with dual antibiotic therapy that includes a {beta}-lactam antibiotic such as cefazolin. This is a paradox as MRSA should be inherently resistant to this class of antibiotics. We report a serendipitous observation revealed a phenotype where MRSA became sensitive to cefazolin when cultured in a physiologic relevant media of fetal bovine serum as well as in synovial fluid. This could be observed across multiple clinical isolates. Expected resistance was maintained when cultured in Muller Hinton Broth (MHB). MRSA {beta}-lactam antibiotic resistance is mediated by PBP2a, a penicillin-binding protein encoded by mecA. We hypothesized that this phenotype of antibiotic sensitivity in physiologic medium was based, in part, on levels of PBP2a expression and post-translational modifications of peptidoglycan wall teichoic acid (WTA). We therefore conducted quantitative RT-PCR analysis and Western blotting which demonstrated limited mecA expression in the mRNA level and limited PBP2a protein level when cultured in FBS or synovial fluid as compared to the clinical microbiology standard MHB, respectively. Whole genome sequencing of loss of function mutants generated through serial passaging in FBS revealed that the clp family of proteins and rpo genes were involved in {beta}-lactam resistance. Cell wall peptidoglycan analysis suggested that WTA glycosylation was altered between {beta}-lactam resistant and sensitive MRSA phenotypes.

Here, we engineer Escherichia coli glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA), the key enzyme in glycolysis, to utilize nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN+) while greatly reducing its original activity with its native cofactor, NAD+. Through rational design, we identify the variant A180S with a ~3-fold increase in NMN+ specific activity compared to that of the wildtype (WT). Next, we design a double mutant, G10R-A180S (RS), where G10R mutation hampers the catalytic efficiency for NAD+ but also decreased the activity toward NMN+. Importantly, based on the hypothesis that the role of NAD+ in coordinating oligomer interface must be recapitulated in NMN+-utilizing enzymes, we develop a triple mutant G10R-A180S-G187Q (RSQ). Rosetta modeling predicts that the new mutation G187Q bridges separate subunits across the cofactor binding pocket, which possibly affords stronger association of the GapA tetramer, the active form of this enzyme. This final GapA variant features a ~2.8 x 104 switch of cofactor specificity from GapA's natural cofactor NAD+ to the non-canonical cofactor NMN+. Overall, this work demonstrates the engineering of a highly conserved, central metabolic enzyme for the utilization of a non-canonical redox cofactor NMN+.

Several colonies carrying a sector appeared on selective glycerol medium and all correspond to a reversion of M3041 by intron deletion. Colonies of revertants resulting from classical reversion were never sectored. The cells of the sectors, called S, presented a very typical growth profile on glycerol (selective medium for respiration) which differs from that of the rest of the colony called AS for anti-sector. The profiles are identical on glucose-based medium. Molecular analysis, by Pulsed Field Gel Electophoresis, of the S cells showed that they had lost one copy of chromosome 1, suggesting that the original a-haploid mutant had diploidized into mat (a/a). The aneuploid state was validated by crossing with a genetically marked strain followed by mass spore analysis. We then asked whether the aneuploid genetic background would influence the frequency of reversion by intron deletion. This was achieved through the conversion of S and AS cells to rho0 followed by cytoduction of mitochondria carrying M3041 or W91 mutations, knowing that W91 never reverses by intron deletion. Interestingly, there are significantly more revertants (by intron deletion) in the S than AS context for M3041, whereas W91 reversed with the same frequency in both contexts. Nuclear aneuploidy therefore promotes mitochondrial reversion by intron-deletion. We conclude that there is a particular relationship between nuclear aneuploidy and intron deletion during the reversion of mitochondrial intron mutations in yeast.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Aneurysms that responded well to FDS showed lower OSI and elevated WSS and TAWSS near the neck region. In contrast, poor responders exhibited larger vortexes and persistently low WSS and TAWSS within the sac, accompanied by high OSI. Geometric factors, such as smaller neck and sac sizes and greater distance from the skull base, also appeared to favor a positive response.

Plasma metformin concentrations were measured by mass spectrometry. Maximal aortic diameters and areas were measured ex vivo. Results: Mass spectrometry analysis determined plasma metformin concentrations in mice administered the drug. Metformin administration resulted in lower body weight compared to the vehicle group, indicating effective metformin administration.

It is expected that this number will continue to rise over the next 15 years with the global aging population. Although mouse models are invaluable for studying human disease, gross anatomical differences between human and murine prostates complicate their translational relevance for BPH/LUTS research. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a nanoCT-based imaging approach to enable detailed anatomical analysis of the murine lower urinary tract, with the dual goals of advancing tools for LUTD research and improving the translational relevance of mouse models to human prostate disease. Advancements in nano-computed tomography (nanoCT) have enabled high-resolution characterization of murine organ anatomy, providing new insights into how morphological differences contribute to pathology. To accomplish this, whole lower urogenital tracts from 8-week-old healthy male C57BL/6J mice and microdissected urethras were imaged on a v|tome|x M or nanotom M nano-CT system, respectively. Images were processed for 2D segmentation and subsequent 3D reconstruction using DragonFly 3D World software. Our approach enabled high-resolution visualization and characterization of the murine lower urogenital tract, including the urinary bladder, prostate lobes, seminal vesicles, and ductus deferens, as well as the microscopic ductal architecture of the prostatic urethra. The resulting 3D reconstructions preserved native anatomical relationships and allowed for comparisons between murine and human prostate anatomy. Together, these findings establish a method that can be used for assessing anatomical and morphological changes associated with LUTD development, while also highlighting key anatomical similarities that enhance the translational relevance of mouse models for human prostate disease.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

To characterise stiffness, compressibility, and elasticity, rheological testing included compressive and shear strain protocols, along with recovery and assessments following contraction-induced strength loss. Relative to WT mice, the tibialis anterior of mdx mice were thicker, stiffer, and less compressible. These genotype differences aligned with hydroxyproline content, a marker of fibrosis. Post-deformation recovery was impaired in mdx mice under shear strain, and eccentric contraction-induced injury further increased stiffness and energy dissipation in the tibialis anterior of mdx mice. This rheological platform maintained the in vivo integrity of the tibialis anterior muscle of mice and consistently showed that storage and loss moduli can sensitively detect the detrimental impact of dystrophin-deficiency on the in vivo viscoelastic properties of skeletal muscle.

However, how these two interacting processes can be performed simultaneously remains unclear. Within the brain it is thought that interaction between the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HPC) supports contextual inference. We show that models of the HPC using environmental features readily support context-specific behaviour, but struggle to differentiate ambiguous contexts during learning. In contrast, models of the PFC using behavioural outcomes can stably differentiate contexts during periods of learning, but struggle to guide context-specific behaviour. Supporting feature-based with outcome-based strategies during learning overcomes the limitations of both approaches, allowing for the formation of distinct contextual representations that support contextual inference. Moreover, agents using this joint approach reproduce both behavioural- and cellular-level phenomena associated with the interaction between PFC and HPC.

Dyads spontaneously converged on distinct stable strategies along the cooperation-competition spectrum, forming three similarly sized groups: cooperative, intermediate, and competitive.

Defects in protein homeostasis frequently leads to neuronal dysfunction and neurological disorders. Given their extreme morphological complexity and high compartmentalization, neurons highly depend on the asymmetrical distribution of their proteome. The common belief is that proteins that sustain axonal, dendritic and synaptic functions are synthesized in the soma and then transported to distal neuronal compartments. However, there is a complementary mechanism by which the mRNAs, and not the proteins, are transported to distal subneuronal domains, and once they reach their destination they are locally translated. Although once considered heretical, local translation (or local protein synthesis) is now widely accepted by the scientific community. Nonetheless there is one question that remains largely unexplored in the field and that is whether local translation in dendrites, axons and synapses is fully regulated by the neuron itself or if non-neuronal cells (e.g. glia) can modulate this mechanism in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Here we show that astroglia regulates local protein synthesis and enhances synaptic markers by releasing extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing ribosomal protein Rps6.

In addition to the somatic membrane, GPR88 can localize to the primary cilium, a membrane microdomain known for dynamically enriching receptors and signaling molecules. However, the distribution of GPR88 in neuronal primary cilia remains uncharacterized. Here we characterize GPR88 distribution at primary cilia in two brain areas. We show that in the striatum, GPR88 localizes both to somatodendritic and primary cilia compartments on inhibitory GABAergic medium spiny neurons. In contrast, in the somatosensory cortex, GPR88 localizes to somatodendritic and nuclear compartments of excitatory spiny stellate neurons which possess primary cilia that exclude GPR88. Additionally, we found that cilia formation and length were similar between GPR88 knockout and wild-type animals. Together, we provide key evidence for neuronal cell-type specific regulation of GPR88 localization to primary cilia, suggesting neuron subtype specific regulatory mechanisms govern receptor ciliary targeting in the brain.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Despite marked phylogenetic distance, the central nervous system of cephalopod mollusks is characterized by a complex network of anatomically interconnected and interacting neuronal populations. Previous studies provide a thorough description of the octopus neural network through neuronal tracing of axonal projections, offering a unique opportunity to systematically examine the brain network architecture. Here, we chart the topological organization of Octopus vulgaris neural network including information on the macroscale interregional pathways between 32 cortical and subcortical regions as provided by a high-quality historical dataset. We found more than 350 main neural connections (afferent, efferent) encompassing the three masses of octopus brain (supra-, sub-oesophageal masses, optic lobes). The octopus brain network possesses multiple nonrandom features promoting segregation and integration, including near-minimal path length, multiscale community structure, hubs, small-world features, and motif composition. Taken together, these attributes support an association between network architecture and function and are consistent with studies in a range of other species, suggesting the existence of a set of universal organizational principles across phylogeny.

{"title": "Amplifying and ameliorating light avoidance in mice with photoreceptor targeting and CGRP sensitization", "doi": "10.1101/2025.05.24.655946", "authors": "Kaiser, E. A.; Cavanah, A.; Aguirre, G. K.; Jensen, F. E.", "abstract": "Objective: To determine the photoreceptor basis of light avoidance in mice and assess the effect of CGRP sensitization on this behavior. Background: Prior studies have suggested that photophobia is mediated by a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that contain melanopsin, making them intrinsically photosensitive (ipRGCs). These cells also receive extrinsic input from cones, which can also mediate light sensitivity. Here, we examined whether spectral variation targeting melanopsin or specific cone types in mice could effectively model light sensitivity. Also, we assessed whether sensitizing mice with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) could amplify ipRGC-mediated light avoidance. Methods: Light avoidance behavior was observed in a two-zone chamber illuminated by narrow-band LEDs targeting photopic opsins: 365 nm (UV; rodent S-cone), 460 nm (blue; melanopsin), and 630 nm (red; human L-cone). In a non-targeted assay, we assessed the degree of light avoidance in wildtype C57BL/6J mice to varying intensities (5 to 100%) of the blue and red LEDs. In a targeted assay, mice were given a choice to spend time between zones with differing relative contrast levels (0.50, 0.75, or 1.00) for the targeted photoreceptor(s). This was assessed in two transgenic mice with: 1) human red cone knock-in (RCKI), or 2) adult-onset ablation of M1 ipRGCs (Opn4aDTA). Mice were studied without intervention or following priming with either peripheral CGRP or vehicle administration every other day for 9 days. A primary measure (mean {+/-} SEM) was the asymptote value (AV). Results: Wildtype mice showed greater light avoidance with increasing light intensity, demonstrating a parametric response. RCKI mice showed avoidance of the high melanopsin (1.00: 0.52 {+/-} 0.08; n = 18) and L-cone (1.00: 0.30 {+/-} 0.11; n = 15) contrast zones but showed a preference for the higher S-cone (1.00: -0.35 {+/-} 0.06; n = 16) contrast zone. These effects decreased with less relative contrast and, thus, contrast dependent. Adding S-cone contrast opposed avoidance to melanopsin (0.10 {+/-} 0.12; n = 14) or L-cone (-0.19 {+/-} 0.10; n = 15) contrast. Ablation of ipRGCs in Opn4aDTA mice attenuated avoidance of melanopsin and preference for S-cone stimulation compared to control littermates. On day 9, CGRP priming led to significantly increased avoidance of melanopsin stimulation (0.58 {+/-} 0.08, n = 21) as compared to vehicle priming (0.26 {+/-} 0.09, n = 22) (F (1,41) = 5.70, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Our findings further support that ipRGCs play a key role in mediating photophobia. This aversive response to light stems from ipRGCs combining excitatory input from intrinsic melanopsin stimulation and extrinsic L-cone input, which can be opposed by extrinsic inhibitory S-cone input. Chronic exposure to CGRP is likely one of many mechanisms in migraine that can amplify ipRGC signals, leading to photophobia.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

However, conventional protocols often rely on volatile, toxic reagents such as formalin or methanol, posing potential health risks to researchers. Here, we present a safer protocol that replaces these chemicals with low-toxicity and commercially available alternatives, without compromising the high detection sensitivity of FISH. We validated this protocol using both in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) and signal amplification by exchange reaction (SABER)-FISH in frozen sections of amphibians, Pleurodeles waltl and Xenopus laevis, as well as the teleost medaka (Oryzias latipes). Our results demonstrate successful multiplexed detection of various morphogenetic genes in these amphibian models and cell-type marker genes in the medaka using this safer protocol. The protocol has the additional advantage of requiring no proteolytic enzyme treatment.

CHASERR is a broadly expressed lncRNA located immediately upstream of the promoter of the CHD2 gene. We show that antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting conserved motifs in CHASERR's last exon induce the formation of a fusion transcript joining CHASERR to CHD2. This fusion transcript is exported to the cytoplasm and translated into full-length CHD2 protein. Deleting the same motifs in mice mimics the ASO effect, increasing CHD2 protein without causing the deleterious effects associated with full CHASERR ablation. The fusion transcripts are also expressed endogenously, induced in activated neurons, and their constitutive induction affects neuronal gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Perinatal introduction of the ASO into Chd2+/- mice up-regulates CHD2 expression and alleviates behavioral phenotypes caused by CHD2 haploinsufficiency, providing a therapeutic route to CHD2 haploinsufficiency. This concept of targeting upstream genes with ASOs to induce transcript fusion can be extended to other gene pairs, and is thus a broadly relevant approach for increasing haploinsufficient gene expression.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

However, the dynamics of ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73), a key enzyme for extracellular adenosine generation, remain elusive. Here, we investigate its spatiotemporal profile from development to adulthood using two transgenic mouse lines. We found that CD73 is transiently expressed in the early astrocyte lineage (Embryonic day 16.5 to Postnatal day [P] 3), becomes prominent in the rod-photoreceptor lineage by P3, and appears in the inner nuclear layer from P7 onward. CD73 deletion delays rod-response recovery and shortens the implicit time in scotopic ERG under dim light. These findings indicate that light and other physiological cues influence CD73 expression, which has significant consequences for retinal function, thereby providing a foundation for exploring disease-related alterations in CD73 and designing therapies that restore adenosine homeostasis.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Here, we present dynamic landscape analysis (DLA), a framework that applies dynamical systems theory to identify stable cell states, map transition pathways, and generate a predictive cell fate decision landscape from single-cell data. Applying this framework to vertebrate neural tube development, we reveal that progenitor specification by Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) can be captured in a landscape with an unexpected circular topology, where initially divergent lineages converge through multiple routes.

Understanding the genetic architecture of such correlations is important for predicting the selection response of populations. Exploration in fishes is a behavioral trait by which individuals may find habitats with better foraging and growth opportunities that subsequently improve their fitness. In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), for example, all individuals are originated in larger rivers that females can lay eggs, but some juveniles migrate to small tributaries that provide favorable habitat patches. The increased growth in these nursery streams may also facilitate earlier sexual maturation, implying a potential correlation between exploration and maturation traits. 2) In this study, by sampling juveniles from two wild populations in the large Teno River catchment in northernmost Fennoscandia, we tested for genetic association between exploration behavior to nursery streams across four SNPs that spans a 70 kb long genomic region with a major effect on age at maturity variation. Three of these SNPs are missense mutations in the vgll3 and akap11 genes, and one SNP tags a putative regulatory region with the strongest association with the age at maturity trait. 3) We show that the exploration behavior was linked to the genomic region in one of the two studied populations. However, the genetic association was substantially stronger in the missense SNP located in the akap11 gene, which is farthest away from the vgll3 SNPs and previously ruled out as being linked to the age at maturity. We also detected a significant interaction between SNPs at the vgll3 gene and akap11, indicating a complex genetic architecture underlying the trait variation. 4) Our results suggest that exploration and age at maturity are co-inherited within the same haplotype block, but we find no evidence for direct causality. The observed genetic interaction may indicate that these two traits form a co-adapted trait complex that may be instrumental in local adaptation processes.", "date": "2025-05-28", "journal": ""}

Our results reveal individuals with hybrid ancestry roughly in proportion to the frequency of individuals of intermediate phenotype recorded in the wild. Individuals with hybrid ancestry were predominantly those with intermediate morphologies, but morphologically-intermediate individuals were not always of hybrid origin, which raises alternative possibilities for the origin and maintenance of color variation in the system. Putatively causal variants for color phenotypes are largely located on the Z chromosome, and we find more candidates on autosomes than in another Colias contact zone.

Variants of a chloride/bicarbonate transporter cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), increase the risk of pancreatitis by two- to three-fold in up to 40% of the patients. However, the relationship between the duct-restricted CFTR-function and total exocrine tissue defect during pancreatitis remains less known and animal models do not clearly translate to human disease. To overcome this challenge, we developed a robust iPSC-derived model system of pancreatic ductal tissues from an idiopathic pancreatitis patient with a common CFTR variant to understand CFTR-associated ductal tissue pancreatitis leading to the complete exocrine defect. In the patient line termed PANx, we found deficient CFTR function as well as a distinct gene expression signature for ductal tissue pancreatitis marked by aberrant mucin production, inflammatory cytokines and pancreatic neoplasms. By applying clinically used CFTR-modulator drug ivacaftor, we observed a remarkable restoration of deficient CFTR-mediated fluid secretion as well as up to 40% reversal of the differential gene signature for PANx including the reduction in mucinous neoplasms and cytokines such as IL-11, CCL20 and CXCL8 that drive immune cell infiltration during pancreatitis. We further employed a microsystem device that modeled pancreatitis-associated hyperamylasemia, a diagnostic feature of acute pancreatitis attack, due to a ductal reaction affecting acinar cell-released amylase and viability. The key mucinous signature was validated in primary pancreatitis ductal tissues with a CFTR variant. Overall, we unraveled new layers of CFTR-related pathology in pancreatitis to help us better understand the course of this debilitating condition.

Cardiac lymphatic vessels are essential for fluid clearance and immune regulation; however, their role in modulating inflammation in autoimmune myocarditis remains largely unclear. METHODS: We investigated the impact of cardiac lymphangiogenesis using a murine model of experimental autoimmune myocarditis induced by cardiac myosin peptide immunization. Human autopsy samples were analyzed for lymphatic expansion. Mice were treated with VEGF-C C156S, a VEGFR3-specific agonist, beginning one week after immunization. Cardiac lymphangiogenesis, myocardial edema, inflammatory infiltration, fibrosis, and cardiac function were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, echocardiography, gene expression analysis, and water content measurements. RESULTS: The VEGF-C treatment accelerated cardiac lymphangiogenesis, enhanced lymphatic drainage, reduced myocardial edema, and attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. Echocardiography showed the preservation of left ventricular function. VEGF-C selectively decreased the accumulation of iNOS inflammatory macrophages without broadly suppressing T cells or reparative macrophages. Bulk RNA sequencing confirmed the down-regulation of inflammatory gene signatures associated with macrophage activation. CONCLUSIONS: The early stimulation of cardiac lymphangiogenesis by VEGF-C promotes the resolution of inflammation, reduces myocardial injury, and preserves cardiac function in autoimmune myocarditis.

Here, we profiled cytokine responses in quadriceps muscle lysates from sedentary, voluntary wheel-running (VWR; 5 weeks), and muscle-specific TFEB-overexpressing (cTFEB;HSACre) male and female mice. Cytokine analysis revealed 40 differentially expressed factors associated with exercise and/or TFEB overexpression, many displaying sex-dimorphic expression patterns. In males, VWR induced significant increases in interleukins (e.g., IL-1, IL-1{beta}, IL-2, IL-5, IL-17) and chemokines (e.g., MCP-1, CCL5, CXCL9), as well as cytokines involved in TNF signaling (e.g., TNF, sTNFR1/2, Fas ligand). TFEB overexpression in sedentary males recapitulated many of these cytokine elevations. In contrast, female runner muscle showed limited cytokine activation, with significant changes restricted to IL-3, IL-3Rb, IL-13, and CXCL16. Both sexes exhibited a reduction in IL-4 and an increase in IGFBP-5 with running. Several additional male-specific cytokine profiling responses, including increases in IFN{gamma}, SCF, TPO, VCAM1A, and leptin, further underscored the sex-specificity of exercise-related inflammatory adaptations. These findings demonstrate that skeletal muscle cytokine responses to endurance-like stimuli are profoundly influenced by sex and suggest that male muscle exhibits a broader and/or later remodeling profile than female muscle.

In this study, a wild-type BSF population was divided into six sub-lines and reared over four generations: one on standard chicken feed (CF), five on a novel diet (WIL), four of which were additionally subjected to directional selection for larval size. Despite their shared genetic origin, sub-lines exhibited divergent trajectories in larval weight and gut bacterial composition. Larval weight increased up to the second (G2) or third generation (G3) but declined sharply at generation four (G4) across all lines. Parent-offspring regressions indicated low narrow-sense heritability and minimal genetic contribution to larval weight. Gut microbiota analysis revealed that early developmental stages were most sensitive to generational shifts, with G3 to G4 transitions showing the strongest shifts in microbial communities. Notably, certain taxa such as Bacillus and Paenibacillus, involved in cellulose degradation, peaked in G2 to G3 but declined at G4, whereas Klebsiella, associated with immune modulation, became more abundant. These trends suggested a shift from growth-associated to digestion-oriented microbial strategies under prolonged dietary stress. However, the absence of universally beneficial taxa and the stochastic emergence of distinct microbial patterns across sub-lines highlighted the plastic and lineage-specific nature of the BSFL gut microbiota.
