Most limb regeneration research has focused on the immediate injury site. Meanwhile, body-wide injury responses remain largely unexplored but may be critical for regeneration. Here, we discovered a role for the sympathetic nervous system in stimulating a body-wide stem cell activation response to amputation that drives enhanced limb regeneration in axolotls. This response is mediated by adrenergic signaling, which coordinates distant cellular activation responses via the 2A-adrenergic receptor, and local regeneration responses via -adrenergic receptors. Both 2A- and {beta}-adrenergic signaling act upstream of mTOR signaling. Notably, systemically-activated axolotls regenerate limbs faster than naive animals, suggesting a potential selective advantage in environments where injury from cannibalism or predation is common. This work challenges the predominant view that cellular responses underlying regeneration are confined to the injury site and argues instead for body-wide cellular priming as a foundational step that enables localized tissue regrowth.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

D.", "abstract": "For most animals, intrinsic senescence-induced mortality increases with age, while deaths from extrinsic threats, such as predation or accidents, decline during development as individuals grow and mature. Age-dependent modulation of extrinsic mortality is known to influence the evolution of aging, yet how the timing of mortality shapes evolutionary forces remains poorly understood. To address this, we developed two complementary mathematical models that integrate survival benefits arising during development with the progressive increase in mortality associated with senescence. Agent-based simulations and deterministic analyses revealed a strong and consistent influence of the timing of developmental survival benefits on their evolutionary impact: early-life survival benefits reduced the selection for slower aging, while late-acting benefits enhanced it. This difference arises because early-life benefits more strongly accelerate population growth than late-life benefits, diminishing the relative evolutionary advantage of increased longevity. Our results underscore the importance of mortality timing in the evolution of aging and provide a theoretical framework for connecting developmental trajectories to aging dynamics.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

These LINE-1 elements represent 21% of the human genome, but only a minority of these sequences retain the coding potential essential for their mobility. LINE-1 encoded proteins can induce cell toxicity implicated in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. However, our knowledge of the expression and localization of LINE-1-encoded proteins in the central nervous system is limited. Using a novel approach combining atlas-based brain mapping with deep-learning algorithms on large-scale pyramidal brain images, we unveil a heterogeneous, neuron-predominant and widespread ORF1p expression throughout the murine brain at steady-state. In aged mice, ORF1p expression increases significantly which is corroborated in human post-mortem dopaminergic neurons by an increase in young LINE-1 elements including those with open reading frames. Mass spectrometry analysis of endogenous mouse ORF1p revealed novel, neuron-specific protein interactors.

Here, we show that the cysteine oxidation state acts as a molecular switch controlling the formation of either amorphous aggregates or flexible fibrils, and that residues 2 to 29 are essential for fibrillation. We also uncover that the HeV W protein (WHeV) can also self-assemble in cellula. WHeV forms distinct types of nuclear condensates that exhibit different dependencies on the cysteine redox-state. While deletion of residues 2-29 prevents formation of nuclear filaments, cysteine-to-serine substitution mainly impairs the formation of non-filamentous condensates. Both infection and WHeV ectopic expression trigger oxidative stress presumably favorable to WHeV condensation. Finally, we show that impaired ability to form redox-sensitive, non-filamentous condensates is associated with a reduced W ability to inhibit the NF-{kappa}B pathway, while it conversely enhances W ability to repress the interferon response pathway.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we provide a structural characterization of the human CTF18-RFC complex and its interaction with PCNA. Our cryo-EM data support that the Ctf8 and Dcc1 subunits of CTF18-RFC, which form the regulatory module interacting with Pol {epsilon}, are flexibly tethered to the RFC module.

The unique RFC1 (Ctf18) large subunit of CTF18-RFC, which based on the cryo-EM map shows high relative flexibility, is anchored to PCNA through an atypical low-affinity PIP box in the AAA+ domain and engages the RFC5 subunit using a novel {beta}-hairpin at the disordered N-terminus. We show that deletion of this hairpin impairs the CTF18-RFC-PCNA complex stability, slows down clamp loading, and decreases the rate of primer synthesis by Pol {epsilon}.

During these periods, synapses undergo plastic modification, while neuronal activities are collectively synchronized, accompanied by large shifts in the excitation-inhibition (EI) balance. These phenomena differ from the learning processes that occur during task engagement. However, the detailed mechanism by which synchronized neuronal activity reshapes neural circuits through plasticity is not yet fully understood. The Kuramoto model is used to study the collective synchronization of oscillators, including neurons. We previously proposed the EI-Kuramoto model, in which an EI balance was implemented in the Kuramoto model. The model alters its synchronicity based on the EI balance of the interaction strength. In this study, we further developed the EI-Kuramoto model by implementing Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, leading to a plastic EI-Kuramoto (pEI-Kuramoto) model. Models with robust inhibition consistently showed desynchronization and stable coupling. Contrastingly, weaker inhibition produced bistable synchronization, in which couplings with intermediate strengths fluctuated, whereas the strongest couplings remained stable. Our findings suggest that the dynamic interplay between network activity and plasticity explains why stronger synapses in the brain exhibit greater stability than their weaker counterparts.

The cold-inducible RNA-binding protein RBM3 is highly expressed in nasopharyngeal tissue and is known to stabilise mRNAs under hypothermic conditions; however, its role during viral infection has not been defined. Here, we identify RBM3 as a key host factor that facilitates IAV replication at sub-physiological temperatures. siRNA-mediated depletion of RBM3 significantly impaired viral replication, while its constitutive overexpression at 37{degrees}C restored replication to levels typically observed at 33{degrees}C. Mechanistically, RBM3 binds directly to viral nucleoprotein (NP) mRNA, prolongs its half-life, and promotes the formation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein granules. This effect was abolished in an RNA-binding-deficient RBM3 mutant, confirming the requirement for direct RNA interaction. Crucially, this positive regulation of NP mRNA was validated in well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial cells, highlighting the physiological relevance of RBM3 in the human URT. These results reveal a temperature-sensitive host-virus interaction that promotes IAV replication in the cooler URT, a key site for viral shedding and transmission.

These inferred ARGs provide a detailed representation of genealogical relatedness along the genome and have been shown to complement genotype imputation in complex trait analyses by capturing the effects of unobserved genomic variants. An inferred ARG can be used to construct a genetic relatedness matrix, which can be leveraged within a linear mixed model for the analysis of complex traits. However, these analyses are computationally infeasible for large datasets. We introduce a computationally efficient approach, called ARG-RHE, to estimate narrow-sense heritability and perform region-based association testing using an ARG. ARG-RHE leverages a method for computing genotype-matrix products from genealogical data in sublinear time, along with scalable randomized algorithms. This enables fast estimation of variance components and their statistical significance, supports parallel analysis of multiple quantitative traits, and facilitates other linear mixed-model analyses. We conduct extensive simulations to verify the computational efficiency, statistical power, and robustness of this approach. We then apply it to detect associations between 21,159 genes and 52 blood-related traits, using an ARG inferred from genotype data of 337,464 individuals from the UK Biobank. In these analyses, combining ARG-based and imputation-based testing yields 8% more gene-trait associations than using imputation alone, suggesting that inferred genome-wide genealogies may effectively complement genotype imputation in the analysis of complex traits.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the ability of a recently developed model to recover co-occurrence estimates under varying sample size and interaction scenarios while increasing model complexity in two dimensions: the number of interacting species and the number of covariates. Using both standard and penalized likelihood, we demonstrate that the ability to quantify interactions in species occupancy using this model is highly sensitive to sample size, detection probability and interaction strength. In the simplest scenario, there is high bias in the interaction parameter (used for co-occurrence inference) with less than 100 sites at high detection, and 400-1000 sites at low detection, depending on interaction strength. Strong co-occurrence is detected consistently above 200 sites with high detection probabilities, but weak co-occurrence is never consistently detected even with 2980 sites. We demonstrate that mean predictive ability of the co-occurrence model is less affected by sample size, with low bias in derived probabilities at 50 sites. Our results highlight that while occupancy patterns are often robust to sample size limitations, reliable inference about co-occurrence demands substantially larger datasets than many studies currently achieve.

In this study, we used a large database of resting state fMRI data (n =322 humans of both sexes included) from across the adult lifespan (ages 18-88) to determine the degree of functional differentiation across the hippocampal posterior-anterior axis. Our first approach was to measure the similarity among signals within hippocampal subregions. We found that signals within the most posterior hippocampal subregion became more similar to one another in older age, but this effect did not relate to memory performance. As a second approach, we measured functional connectivity between hippocampal subregions and the rest of the brain. The functional connectivity profiles of the posterior and anterior hippocampal subregions became more distinct from one another with increasing age, driven by relative stability in anterior hippocampal functional connectivity but more significant age-related differences in posterior subregions of the hippocampus.

Despite its significance, the mechanisms driving A{beta} deposition in PVS and the resulting vascular pathology remain poorly understood. Growing evidence suggests that fibrinogen, the main component in blood clots, interacts with A{beta} and exacerbates inflammation in AD. Fibrinogen also co-deposits with A{beta} in the PVS of CAA-positive vessels in the brains of hereditary CAA patients. However, the mechanisms by which fibrinogen contributes to cerebrovascular impairment remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we used TgSwDI transgenic mice, which develop robust CAA pathology, and observed a significant increase in fibrin(ogen) extravasation and colocalization with A{beta} in the PVS. Moreover, we observed a significant aquaporin-4 (AQP4) depolarization in CAA-laden blood vessels of TgSwDI mice, which correlated with fibrin(ogen)-A{beta} colocalization. Given AQP4 crucial role in A{beta} clearance through glymphatic pathway, its depolarization may disrupt critical A{beta} clearance, thereby exacerbating CAA pathology. Additionally, Caveolin-1, a protein involved in non-specific transcytosis across the endothelium, significantly increased with age in TgSwDI mice and correlated with fibrin(ogen) extravasation. To further explore the relationship between fibrin(ogen) and these cerebrovascular alterations, we depleted fibrinogen in TgSwDI mice using siRNA approach. This intervention resulted in decreased CAA, restored polarized expression of AQP4, reduced caveolin-1 levels, attenuated microglial activation, and improved spatial memory in fibrinogen-depleted TgSwDI mice.

Recent experiments suggest that this mechanism also controls the clustering of eukaryotic chromosomes during the late stages of cell division. In this process, inter-chromosome attraction is driven by the condensation of cytoplasmic RNA and Ki-67, a charged intrinsically disordered protein that coats the chromosomes as a brush. Attraction between chromosomes has been shown to be specifically promoted by a localized charged patch on Ki-67, although the physical mechanism remains unclear. To elucidate this process, we combine here coarse-grained simulations and analytical theory to study the RNA-mediated interaction between charged polymer brushes on the chromosome surfaces. We show that the charged patch on Ki-67 leads to inter-chromosome attraction via RNA bridging between the two brushes, whereby the RNA preferentially interacts with the charged patches, leading to stable, long-range forces. By contrast, if the brush is uniformly charged, bridging is basically absent due to complete adsorption of RNA onto the brush. Moreover, the RNA dynamics becomes caged in presence of the charged patch, while remaining diffusive with uniform charge. Our work sheds light on the physical origin of chromosome clustering, while also suggesting a general mechanism for cells to tune work production by biomolecular condensates via different charge distributions.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Subjective dimensions of stress perception, such as perceived control, are especially potent in shaping stress responses. While the impact of reduced or no control over stress is well understood, much less is known about whether heightened feelings of control buffer against the negative impact of later stress. We designed a novel paradigm with excellent psychometric properties to sensitively capture and induce different states of subjective control. Across two studies with a total of 768 neurotypical adults, we show a robust association between sense of control and stress as well as symptoms of mental ill-health. More importantly, in a subsample of 295 participants we show that compared to a neutral control group, inducing a heightened state of subjective control buffers against the impact of later stress.

However, we know little about the genes they contain that control the development of the inflorescences. Here we assembled genomes, with phased sex chromosomes, for hop and cannabis. The XY chromosomes share an origin prior to the divergence between the genera >36 MYA. Due to the inheritance patterns of the XYs, the male-specific region of the Y is highly-degenerated, with substantial gene loss, while the X shows faster rates of molecular evolution. Consistent with the theory that these species lack an active-Y system, no clear sex-determining genes reside on the Y. Instead, an X-linked homolog of aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (ACS), that is involved in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway, determines the fate of the female inflorescence. Beyond sex determination, the sex chromosomes contribute to the sexual dimorphism in ecology and physiology and have played a role in the domestication and breeding of these species.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

This allowed us to capture more natural sequential behavior while maintaining the benefits of experimental control. Participants intercepted a moving ball by sliding a paddle at the bottom of the screen so that the ball bounced back and moved toward the computerized opponent. We tested i) how participants adapted their eye, hand, and head movements to this dynamic, continuous task, ii) whether these adaptations are related to interception performance, and iii) how their behavior changed under different conditions and over time. We found that eye, hand, and head movements are largely shaped towards participant's action (and lesser so towards the opponent's action). Movements that reduce or destabilize visual input, like saccades, blinks and head movements, are reduced during critical periods of interception. Instead, participants increase the frequency of pursuit eye movements, ensuring that they closely track the ball when their action comes closer. This pursuit strategy is associated with better game performance. Our results demonstrate an orchestration of eye, head, and hand movement patterns, which is rapidly established and finely adjusted to meet the evolving demands of impending actions and task demands.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Among the traditional electrophysiological methods, micro-electrocorticography (ECoG) is appealing for chronic applications because it provides a good compromise between invasiveness and high-resolution neural recording. When combining ECoG with optical technologies, such as calcium imaging and optogenetics, this multi-modal approach enables the simultaneous collection of neural activity from individual neurons and the ability to perform cell-specific manipulation. While previous efforts have focused on multi-modal interfaces for small animal models, scaling these technologies to larger brains, of primates, remains challenging. In this paper, we present a multi-modal neural interface, named Smart Dura, a functional version of the commonly used artificial dura with integrated electrophysiological electrodes for large cortical area coverage for the NHP brain. The Smart Dura is fabricated using a novel thin-film microfabrication process to monolithically integrate a micron-scale electrode array into a soft, flexible, and transparent substrate with high-density electrodes (up to 256 electrodes) while providing matched mechanical compliance with the native tissue and achieving high optical transparency (exceeding 97%). Our in vivo experiments demonstrate electrophysiological recording capabilities combined with neuromodulation, as well as optical transparency via multiphoton imaging. This work paves the way toward a chronic neural interface that can provide large-scale, bidirectional interfacing for multimodal and closed-loop neuromodulation capabilities to study cortical brain activity in non-human primates, with the potential for translation to humans.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Problem-solving, in turn, depends on goal-directed generation of novel thoughts and behaviors, which has been proposed to rely on internal representations of discrete units, or symbols, and processes that can recombine them into a large set of possible composite representations. Although this view has been influential in formulating cognitive-level explanations of behavior, definitive evidence for a neuronal substrate of symbols has remained elusive. Here, we identify a neural population encoding action symbols--internal, recombinable representations of discrete units of motor behavior--localized to a specific area of frontal cortex. In macaque monkeys performing a drawing-like task designed to assess recombination of learned action symbols into novel sequences, we found behavioral evidence for three critical features that indicate actions have an underlying symbolic representation: (i) invariance over low-level motor parameters; (ii) categorical structure, reflecting discrete types of action; and (iii) recombination into novel sequences. In simultaneous neural recordings across motor, premotor, and prefrontal cortex, we found that planning-related population activity in ventral premotor cortex (PMv) encodes actions in a manner that, like behavior, reflects motor invariance, categorical structure, and recombination, three properties indicating a symbolic representation. Activity in no other recorded area exhibited this combination of properties. These findings reveal a neural representation of action symbols localized to PMv, and therefore identify a putative neural substrate for symbolic cognitive operations.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), first discovered in the 1980s, have exhibited significant potential against a broad range of bacteria [1]. Short-sequenced AMPs are abundant in nature and present across various organisms [2]. With lower likelihood of developing resistance, thousands of cationic and hydrophobic AMPs have been identified to act selectively on microbes, making them excellent anti-infective candidates in medicine, food, farming, and agriculture. Recently, machine learning technologies such as Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR) have enabled expedited discovery of potential AMPs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity as the amount of available AMP training data increases [3]. Among those, Deep QSAR has recently emerged as a distinct type of application that utilizes conventional molecular descriptors [4] in conjunction with more powerful deep learning (DL) models [5]. Here, we demonstrate the power of Deep QSAR in predicting broad-spectrum AMP activity. Our approach utilizes a recurrent neural network to perform QSAR regression modeling and achieves nearly 90% five-fold cross-validated accuracy in predicting AMP antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential. Using the developed approach, we designed 100 novel peptides, of which 44 experimentally demonstrated more effective antibiofilm activity and 31 peptides exhibited stronger antimicrobial activity compared to the known antibiofilm/antimicrobial peptide IDR-1018 [6] used as a positive control.

There is evidence of altered functions in neutrophils isolated from AD patients. Whether these altered functions are inherent to the AD disease state is unknown. The goal of this study was to determine if neutrophil functions are altered in AD mice and if these changes occur only after symptoms appear. To address this hypothesis, we used a primary neuronal culture model, generated from 3xTg perinatal mice, since AD is considered a CNS disease. The 3xTg primary neuronal culture gradually increase the release of A{beta} (40 and 42) as the culture ages. To assess neutrophil functions, neutrophils isolated from young male/female mice (3-6 months of age) or aged male/female mice (16-18 months of age) of WT or 3xTg mice were exposed to 3xTg primary neuronal cultures. To assess phagocytosis, we characterized the effect of neutrophils on pathogenic amyloid beta (A{beta}) 42 levels. To assess the levels of immune modulators (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, NETosis, and neutrophil granular content), culture media were assessed using Luminex multiplex assay. Our results show that neutrophils from young AD mice have impaired phagocytosis, as observed in a decreased ability to remove A{beta} and cellular debris in vitro. Neutrophils from young AD mice also increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, granule content, and NETs in 3xTg primary neuronal cultures. Interestingly, neutrophils from aged 3xTg mice decreased A{beta} levels in culture and expression of proinflammatory cytokines when compared to neutrophils from aged WT mice. These neutrophils increased their release of granule content and NETs in 3xTg primary neuronal cultures.

To uncover the molecular grammar underlying this decision, we used artificial intelligence to build a predictive machine learning model trained on experimentally validated data. This AI-driven model, integrating 77 biologically informed features, accurately predicts strand preference not only in nematodes but also across vertebrates, including humans, revealing compositional and structural biases that are conserved yet functionally repurposed.

J.", "abstract": "Porous materials, such as biological tissue, often have heterogeneous microstructures where imbibed fluid experiences distinct environments on short timescales, but can exchange among different environments over long timescales. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods such as diffusion exchange spectroscopy (DEXSY) can measure this exchange in water under steady-state and equilibrium conditions; however, modeling becomes more complex when more than two exchanging environments are involved. This complexity is particularly relevant in the central nervous system (CNS), where water diffusion and exchange at the cellular level play critical roles in homeostasis. While DEXSY can measure these processes, they may not be adequately modeled as two-site exchange between intracellular and extracellular spaces (ICS and ECS). Here we study the behavior of apparent exchange rate constants (AXR) estimated from DEXSY data numerically simulated using a three-site exchange model (3XM). The 3XM is based on gray matter microstructural characteristics, incorporating both transmembrane exchange between ECS and ICS and geometric exchange between environments within ICS where water mobility differs due to the complex architecture of neurons, glial cells, and the ECS. Inspired by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump-leak model of cell volume maintenance, the 3XM accounts for effects of osmolytes, ions, and voltage on ECS and ICS volume fraction. The model predicts a significant reduction in AXR and a smaller decrease in apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) following the level of membrane depolarization expected from Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition. These changes were reversed by the addition of membrane-impermeable ECS osmolytes, independent of voltage, in agreement with previous experiments. While the exchange rate constants for each pathway simply follow first-order kinetics, the AXR's sensitivity to these pathways depends on the ECS volume fraction. When ECS is present, transmembrane exchange dominates, but when cells swell following pump inhibition, geometric exchange becomes the dominant pathway.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

A hallmark of STm is their ability to survive and replicate in the macrophages that phagocytose them. Inside the Salmonella-containing vesicles (SCV) STm is exposed to nutrient limitation and antimicrobial molecules, including itaconate, a dicarboxylate produced at millimolar concentrations by activated macrophages. STm has an itaconate degradation pathway that allows it to detoxify itaconate and convert it into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. In the SCV, STm undergoes extensive metabolic reprogramming in response to the nutrient limitation and high stress environment, and strict catabolite control is employed at various stages of infection, depending on carbon source availability. The extent to which itaconate is used as a carbon source by STm is not currently well understood. Here, we explore the ability of STm to grow in media containing itaconate as the sole carbon source, identify the genes of the itaconate response operon necessary for itaconate degradation, and confirm their importance during infection of macrophages. Growth on itaconate was substantially slower than in carbon-rich or acetate media, with multiple subcultures allowing for increased growth rates. Genomic analysis suggests that mutations in the RpoS-stress response and increased expression of the DctA transporter improve growth on itaconate. Using metabolomics, it was revealed that growth on itaconate resulted in substantially reduced levels of gluconeogenesis compared to growth on acetate and increased glutathione disulfide levels, indicating a high level of oxidative stress. Overall, our results point towards the STm itaconate degradation pathway having a more important role in detoxifying itaconate, rather than using it as a carbon source inside the macrophage. Additionally, this study establishes media conditions that would enable the high throughput discovery of potential inhibitors of itaconate degradation.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

We present MintFlow, a generative AI algorithm that learns how the tissue microenvironment influences cell states and predicts how tissue perturbations can reprogram them. Applied to three human diseases, MintFlow uncovered distinct pathogenic spatial reprogramming in inflammatory and tumor microenvironments. In atopic dermatitis, MintFlow identified a novel, spatially-imprinted, type 2 (IL13+ITGAE+) epidermal T resident memory cell population (type 2 TRM), and decoded signaling pathways within the perivascular lymphoid niche. In melanoma, MintFlow identified fibrotic stroma resembling keloid scar tissue. In kidney cancer, MintFlow resolved immunosuppressed CD8+ T cell states within tertiary lymphoid structures. Furthermore, MintFlow enabled in silico perturbations of disease-relevant cell states and tissue environments. Regulatory T cell modulation in atopic dermatitis was predicted to suppress the pro-inflammatory tissue environment, supporting manipulation of these cells as a therapeutic target. In kidney cancer, in silico T cell replacement recapitulated immune checkpoint blockade, while spatially targeted macrophage depletion reverted immunosuppressed T cell states. The corresponding gene programs correlated with survival in large kidney cancer patient cohorts. Together, these findings position MintFlow as a tool for unbiased disease mechanism prediction and in silico perturbation, accelerating translational hypothesis generation and guiding therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

A.; Rueda-M, N.; Salazar, C.; Bak, S.; Montgomery, S. H.; Jiggins, C. D.", "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity occurs when a genotype can produce more than one phenotype under different environmental conditions. Genetic accommodation allows plastic phenotypes to be tuned to new environments and eventually to even be lost via canalization/assimilation. The colourful and toxic Heliconiini butterflies have biochemical plasticity: they either sequester their cyanogenic glucosides (CG) from their larval hostplant or biosynthesize them when compounds for sequestration are not available. Here, we traced the evolution of CG biosynthesis in Heliconiini butterflies, a fundamental component of this biochemical plasticity. We first CRISPR-edited the CYP405s, which encode the first enzyme of this pathway in Heliconius erato, and confirmed that CYP405-knockout caterpillars do not biosynthesize CGs. Then, we identified the CYP405s and CYP332s (the second gene in this pathway) in 63 species of the subfamily Heliconiinae, as well as in other lepidopterans. Most lepidopterans have a CYP332, but CYP405 is mostly found in butterflies and has been duplicated in all Heliconius species. Both genes were independently co-opted into CG biosynthesis in the Heliconiinae butterflies and Zygaena moths, in which they were first functionally characterized. Finally, we performed ancestral reconstruction analyses of biochemical plasticity using data from over 700 Heliconiini butterflies. We demonstrated that although plasticity was ancestral in the whole tribe and allowed these butterflies to increase their hostplant range, it might have been lost in few specialized clades, such as the Sapho clade that just sequester CG from their hostplants. This clade has several CYP405 copies, but they lack structurally important P450 domains, which may explain why biosynthesized CGs are virtually lost in species of the Sapho clade. Our findings represent one of the few examples of plasticity-first evolution in which the genetic mechanisms associated with its accommodation/assimilation are known. This study also emphasizes the importance of co-option in the evolution of complex traits, such as toxicity.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

This study investigates structural analogues of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist KH-5, focusing on the impact of modifications to the nitrogen-containing heterocycle on receptor binding, affinity, and duration of functional antagonism. A series of 4-(hexyloxy)benzoate derivatives and their N-methylated quaternary ammonium salts were synthesised, characterised, and tested for binding affinity at all five muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1-M5). Molecular docking and dynamics simulations revealed that stable hydrogen bonding to N6.52 and salt bridge formation with D3.32 were critical for ligand-receptor interactions. Experimental data indicated that compounds containing an azabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-1-ium group (e.g., 10a, 11a) exhibited the highest affinity and potency (up to 250-fold compared to lead compounds). However, these compounds had shorter functional antagonism half-lives compared to lead compounds, likely due to reduced molecular flexibility. Conversely, analogues retaining moderate flexibility (e.g., 7g) showed a balance between potency and sustained action. Structure- activity analysis demonstrated that charged nitrogen and the presence of a 4-hexyloxy substituent were critical for binding and prolonged activity. Shortening the alkoxy chain markedly decreased affinity and abolished long-term antagonism. Docking energies alone were insufficient to distinguish binders from non-binders; however, molecular dynamics-based metrics such as stable hydrogen bonding to N6.52 better predicted affinity. These findings emphasise the need for optimal spatial arrangement and charge distribution for high-affinity, long-residence muscarinic antagonists and provide a framework for future design of therapeutic agents targeting mAChRs.\n\nHighlightsO_LINew analogues show up to 250x higher affinity at muscarinic receptors\nC_LIO_LIN6.52 H-bonding during MD predicts compound binding better than docking energies\nC_LIO_LICharged nitrogen and 4-hexyloxy are key to high affinity and sustained action\nC_LIO_LIRigid azabicyclo groups boost potency but shorten antagonism duration\nC_LIO_LIFlexible analogues balance potency with longer receptor residence time better\nC_LI", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

One approach to target these channels, is to manipulate the membrane charge which involves the use of wireless bipolar electrodes such as carbon nanotube porins (CNTPs), which could be inserted into cell membranes to mimic these channels, to provide a novel bioelectronic method for modulating cancer cell behavior. By utilizing membrane dyes, we observed alterations in Vmem induced by CNTPs and externally applied electric fields. Analyses of cellular behaviors and processes indicated that Vmem is more receptive to stimuli in invasive cancers, while it leads to increased metabolism in less invasive cancers, with notable changes in the cell cycle occurring at approximately 48 hours post-treatment in GBM cell lines.

R.", "abstract": "Noncoding genetic variants underlie many complex diseases, yet identifying and interpreting their functional impacts remains challenging. Late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), a polygenic neurodegenerative disorder, exemplifies this challenge. The disease is strongly associated with noncoding variation, including common variants enriched in microglial enhancers and rare variants that are hypothesized to influence neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. These variants often perturb regulatory sequences by disrupting transcription factor (TF) motifs or altering local TF interactions, thereby reshaping gene expression and chromatin accessibility. However, assessing their impact is complicated by the context-dependent functions of regulatory sequences, underscoring the need to systematically examine variant effects across diverse tissues, cell types, and cellular states. Here, we combined in vitro and in vivo massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) with interpretable machine-learning models to systematically characterize common and rare variants across myeloid and neural contexts. Parallel profiling of variants in four immune states in vitro and three mouse brain regions in vivo revealed that individual variants can differentially and even oppositely modulate regulatory function depending on cell-type and cell-state contexts. Common variants associated with LOAD tended to exert stronger effects in immune contexts, whereas rare variants showed more pronounced impacts in brain contexts. Interpretable sequence-to-function deep-learning models elucidated how genetic variation leads to cell-type-specific differences in regulatory activity, pinpointing both direct transcription-factor motif disruptions and subtler tuning of motif context. To probe the broader functional consequences of a locus prioritized by our reporter assays and models, we used CRISPR interference to silence an enhancer within the SEC63-OSTM1 locus that harbors four functional rare variants, revealing its gatekeeper role in inflammation and amyloidogenesis. These findings underscore the context-dependent nature of noncoding variant effects in LOAD and provide a generalizable framework for the mechanistic interpretation of risk alleles in complex diseases.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

The aim of this study was to determine whether the aberrant venous lumen expansion is caused by recruitment of wild-type endothelial cells (EC) to the lesion or by TIE2-mutant EC clonal expansion.\n\nMethodsTo investigate the contribution of TIE2-mutant EC and wild-type EC to the aberrant venous lumen expansion, we used a xenograft murine model of VM generated with a combination of TIE2-mutant EC and wild-type EC. To perform longitudinal studies, we employed a three-dimensional (3D) fibrin gel lumen formation assay and a migration assay, both using wild-type EC in competition or confrontation with TIE2-mutant EC. To investigate the mechanisms implicated in VM lumen expansion we used RNA-sequencing and short interference (sh)RNA in the TIE2-mutant EC.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate here that in the VM xenograft model, the aberrant blood vessels were lined almost exclusively by TIE2-mutant EC, and wild-type EC were rarely found. Functionally, the TIE2-mutant EC exerted a competitive advantage over wild-type EC by inhibiting wild-type EC sprouting. In line with these findings, TIE2-mutant EC promoted repulsion of wild-type EC.

Analysis of growth in heart infusion broth showed that the fowl cholera isolate VP161 (capsule type A and LPS type L1) and the bovine haemorrhagic septicaemia isolate M1404 (capsule type B and LPS type L2) shared 461 genes essential for growth in rich media, with 95% of these present in all publicly available closed P. multocida genomes. In vivo fitness analysis identified 63 and 94 genes important for VP161 and M1404 survival in BALB/c mice, respectively. Only 35 homologs were identified as important for survival in both strains, showing that conserved biological systems can be differentially important for different P. multocida strains. Investigation of proteins involved in the catabolite response showed that an active cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) was required for maximal fitness in M1404.

Bats, in particular, are recognized as natural reservoirs for several zoonotic viral pathogens of high impact on public health, including coronaviruses responsible for SARS, the rabies virus, Marburg, Ebola, Nipah and Hendra viruses. However, the large extent of bat viruses remains unexplored, especially in highly biodiverse regions of the Neotropics such as Brazil. We used a meta-transcriptomic to characterize new virus genomes found in blood, oral and anal samples collected from cave- and non-cave bats from Northeast Brazil. From a total of 19 coronavirus-positive bats, we have assembled two complete genomes of a new Betacoronavirus subgenus, named Ambecovirus (American betacoronavirus). The subgenus herein described is phylogenetically placed between the Sarbeco-/Hibeco-/Nebecovirus and the Merbeco-/Embecovirus clades, being basal to the former. While the conserved S2 region of the spike protein retained hallmark domains, including HR1 and HR2, the S1/S2 cleavage site and the furin cleavage site, the S1 region consistently displayed only the N-terminal domain. The receptor-binding domain could not be identified due to high dissimilarity relative to known congeneres. The detection of Ambercovirus in sympatric Pteronotus gymnonotus and Carollia perspicillata bats suggests interspecies transmission. Longitudinal sampling confirmed persistent Ambecovirus infection infection in P. gymnonotus over multiple years and virus dispersion at a minimum distance of 270 km between caves.

Sound-onset event-related potentials (ERPs) have been well-characterised in electroencephalography (EEG) studies, but the characteristics of sound-offset ERPs have often been obscured by temporal confounds in experimental design. Here, two EEG studies were conducted in human listeners performing an interval duration discrimination task with (i) noise intervals in silence or (ii) silent intervals (gaps) in noise. Stimuli used in the active task were also presented under passive listening conditions. This design enabled us to investigate whether features of the offset ERP could be masked by task demands, and whether the usual temporal precedence of the onset cue in a sound influences the relative magnitude and shape of onset and offset ERPs. The morphology of the offset ERP was distinct from that of the onset ERP in both noise and silent interval duration discrimination tasks, even though the roles of onset and offset cues as initial versus final markers of interval duration were reversed. This observation corroborates evidence from animal studies that there are fundamental differences in brain mechanisms of onset and offset perception. In all experimental conditions, the amplitude of the offset ERP was one-third to one-half that of the onset ERP. Differences between active and passive listening conditions were largely explained by enhancement of ERPs for whichever cue (onset or offset) marked the end of the intervals compared in the duration discrimination task.

Interactions between vHPC projections and mPFC interneurons, and their plasticity, are uniquely positioned to influence SWM, yet the nature of these interactions remains unclear. Here, we combined in vivo optical stimulation of vHPC inputs to mPFC with calcium recordings of discrete mPFC interneuron populations in mice, revealing class-specific response profiles and plasticity. Repeated vHPC input stimulation persistently depressed activity in vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons and potentiated activity in somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology and computational modeling revealed that these divergent effects likely arise from a primary weakening of monosynaptic vHPC input onto VIP interneurons. Leveraging this plasticity to inform the circuit interactions that support SWM, we found that mice with prior vHPC input stimulation displayed elevated VIP interneuron activity during the delay epoch in early SWM task training, and this enhanced activity correlated with poorer training performance. Accordingly, mice modeling the schizophrenia-predisposing 22q11.2 deletion syndrome with known SWM learning deficits recapitulated this aberrant VIP interneuron activity profile and showed reduced vHPC targeting of mPFC VIP interneurons.

Our results revealed distinct patterns of network dynamics depending on task demands. During AM retrieval, effective connectivity was characterized by vmPFC-driven top-down modulation primarily targeting the precuneus, supporting the temporal and self-relevant structuring of episodic memory. In contrast, extended scenario imagination engaged hippocampal bidirectional influences with both vmPFC and precuneus, reflecting the dynamic simulation and integration of unfolding events. Single Scene construction shifted network leadership to the precuneus, which exerted modulatory effects on both vmPFC and hippocampus, consistent with its pivotal role in spatial integration and the generation of coherent mental scenes. Object imagery showed minimal stable connectivity within this network, suggesting limited engagement of the hippocampal-default mode circuit during simpler visual representations. Together, our findings highlight a flexible, task-dependent reorganization of effective connectivity within the vmPFC-hippocampus-precuneus network during the construction of rich mental experiences.

Here, we investigated the role of the chromatin remodeler ATRX in astrocytes by generating mice with inducible, astrocyte-specific Atrx deletion (aiKO) using tamoxifen administration at postnatal days 10-12, resulting in ATRX loss in approximately half of hippocampal and cortical astrocytes. Transcriptomic profiling of hippocampal tissue at one and three months revealed a progressive increase in differentially expressed genes, with early enrichment for cytoskeletal and immune pathways and later dysregulation of energy metabolism, ion transport, and synaptic gene sets. Electrophysiological recordings from CA1 pyramidal neurons in aiKO slices demonstrated increased neuronal excitability, reduced membrane capacitance, and decreased frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, indicating non-cell-autonomous neuronal dysfunction. Morphological analysis identified a transient reduction in dendritic branching at one month and a selective loss of thin dendritic spines by three months, without changes in total dendrite length or overall spine density. Behaviorally, aiKO mice displayed normal locomotion, anxiety, and short-term memory, but exhibited deficits in 24-hour novel object recognition and long-term spatial memory in the Morris water maze. These findings demonstrate that ATRX-mediated chromatin remodeling in astrocytes is essential for maintaining hippocampal transcriptional homeostasis, neuronal function, and long-term memory. Our results highlight a critical role for astrocytic epigenetic regulation in cognitive processes and suggest that astrocyte dysfunction may contribute to the pathogenesis of ATR-X syndrome and related intellectual disability disorders, underscoring the importance of targeting multiple cell types for therapeutic intervention.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAstrocytic ATRX loss causes non-cell-autonomous neuronal hyperexcitability\nC_LIO_LIInducing ATRX deficiency in astrocytes causes selective long-term memory deficits\nC_LIO_LIDynamic transcriptomic changes reveal metabolic and synaptic pathway dysregulation\nC_LI", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Using concurrent fMRI and dopamine photometry in awake, behaving mice, we reveal that associative learning induces a gradual temporal shift in NAc blood oxygenation responses that mirrors dopamine release dynamics. This shift emerges with cue-reward learning and extends across a distributed network including prefrontal, insular, and hypothalamic regions. Further, dopamine transients tightly correspond with local BOLD signals, and variations in reward value modulate delayed BOLD responses in both the NAc and additional subcortical structures. Removing dopaminergic contributions abolishes this reward-related modulation, demonstrating that BOLD signals encode dopaminergic value prediction. These findings establish a mechanistic link between dopamine signaling and widespread neural plasticity during learning.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

However, underlying mechanisms remain unclear due to the heterogeneity of preterm insults, the most prominent being prenatal maternal immune activation (MIA) and neonatal hypoxia (Hx). To examine how individual or sequential insults affect cerebellar function, we utilized a double-hit (DH) mouse model that integrates both exposures. Comparative analysis showed that this model recapitulates key features of the human preterm cerebellum, allowing systematic evaluation of insult-specific outcomes. Isolated Hx triggered S-phase arrest in mature granule cells, disrupted Purkinje cell synaptic integration, and led to both motor and social deficits. In contrast, when Hx followed MIA (DH), it delayed granule cell maturation with G2-phase retention and triggered progressive mitochondrial dysfunction. While DH mice developed motor-cognitive impairments, sociability was preserved.

H.; Nevian, T.; Zuber, B.; Rostami, I.", "abstract": "A vital question in neuroscience is if and how efficiently cellular models may be differentiated into functional neuronal cells in culture. Despite the frequent use of the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, differentiation protocols vary extensively, with the most common being differentiation via the addition of retinoic acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. However, due to the lack of a reliable evaluation method, their adequacy as synaptic models remains unclear. Here, we investigate whether SH-SY5Y cells constitute a functional model for synaptic studies by phenotypically and ultra structurally analyzing synaptogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells subjected to different differentiation protocols. Electron microscopy (EM) techniques, including conventional EM, cryo-EM, and cryo-electron tomography, were systematically applied to characterize synaptogenesis in SH-SY5Y cells. Further characterization was performed through immunostaining and functional assays, such as live exocytosis assays and whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology. Despite exhibiting some presynaptic-like features, differentiated SH-SY5Y cells do not form morphologically or functionally complete synapses under the conditions tested. Immunostaining results were consistent with previous findings, showing synaptic markers. However, functional investigations did not detect synaptic activity. High-throughput EM analyses revealed an absence of synaptic structures in these cells. Additionally, an alternative differentiation approach incorporating additional neurotrophic factors promoted the formation of pre-synaptic-like compartments containing synapse-like synaptic vesicles (SVLVs). Though these SVLVs exhibited pleomorphic size distributions, differing from typical synaptic vesicles, and lacked connectors. These findings emphasize the need for cautious interpretation of results derived from SH-SY5Y cells when studying molecular synaptic architecture or neurodegenerative diseases.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

J.-B.; Uller, T.; Flecks, M.; Gabelaia, M.; Hipsley, C.; Kirchner, M.; Mu\u0308ller, J.; Feiner, N.", "abstract": "The vertebrate skull originates from two embryonic lineages, the mesoderm and the neural crest, offering a unique framework to study how developmental mechanisms connect phenotypic variation and evolutionary diversification. Using 3D geometric morphometrics, we analysed skull shape variation in lacertid lizards. Mesoderm- and neural crest-derived bones formed distinct, conserved modules at both micro- and macroevolutionary scales. In the common wall lizard (Podarcis muralis), rapid evolution of skull shape under sexual selection was primarily driven by neural crest-derived bones. While the primary axis of shape divergence in P. muralis aligned with a major axis of variation across lacertids, neural crest-derived bones exhibited slower evolutionary rates and lower morphological disparity than mesodermal-derived bones. We propose that this discrepancy between the role of the neural crest for skull evolution on micro- and macroevolution reflects constraints imposed by neural crest cell biology: although developmental plasticity enables rapid, correlated responses under sexual selection, pleiotropy may limit long-term evolvability of neural crest-derived skull regions.\n\nTeaser textThe bones of the vertebrate skull come from two developmental sources: the mesoderm and the neural crest. This dual origin allows to study how development influences evolution. Using 3D models of lizard skulls--including a species with exaggerated male traits linked to the neural crest--we examined patterns of skull variation. We found that neural crest-derived bones contribute to rapid changes driven by sexual selection. However, across different species, these same skull regions evolve more slowly and show less variation. This suggests that while neural crest cells may constrain long-term evolution because of their wide influence, they can also enable fast adaptations. The developmental biology of a trait therefore shapes its evolution.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

In humans, defects in ZIC2 cause holoprosencephaly, a congenital brain malformation characterized by the defective cleavage of cerebral hemispheres due to problems in midline patterning. However, the gene regulatory network (GRN) controlled by ZIC2 and the regulatory mechanisms it employs during neural development remain largely unexplored. Here, we combined a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) in vitro differentiation model towards anterior neural progenitors (AntNPCs) with genome editing approaches, bulk and single cell (i.e. Multiome scATAC + scRNAseq) genomic methods to elucidate the precise GRN controlled by ZIC2 and the underlying mechanisms. We found that ZIC2 shows widespread binding throughout the genome already in mESC as well as upon pluripotency exit and neural induction. Despite its extensive binding in mESC, ZIC2 function is dispensable in pluripotent cells due to compensation by ZIC3. In contrast, ZIC2 plays a major regulatory function during neural induction, directly controlling the expression of master regulators implicated in the patterning and morphogenesis of specific brain regions, such as the midbrain (e.g., En1, Lmx1b, Pax2, Wnt1) and the roof plate (e.g., Lmx1a, Wnt3a). Mechanistically, ZIC2 plays a dual role in neural differentiation: (i) during pluripotency exit, ZIC2 acts as a pioneer TF, binding de novo to distal enhancers and promoting their chromatin accessibility; (ii) during neural induction, ZIC2 is essential for the activation of a subset of the previously primed enhancers, which in turn control the expression of major neural patterning regulators and signaling pathways (i.e. WNT) that prevent the premature differentiation of neural progenitors. Overall, our work shows that, by sequentially acting as a promiscuous pioneer and selective activator of enhancer elements, ZIC2 canalizes pluripotent cells towards neural progenitors with rostro-dorsal identities.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

While significant progress has been made in identifying and quantifying archaic introgression, most studies have focused on contemporary individual genomic data. As a result, relatively little is known about the evolution of archaic variants within modern human populations shortly after interbreeding occurred. While analysis of ancient DNA from modern humans offers the potential to address this scientific gap, its poor quality has hindered its exploration.

We tested the reliability of detecting and quantifying archaic introgression using D-statistics and the f4-ratio.

Our results reveal that pro-inflammatory activation of microglia impairs pruning efficiency under reduced synaptic activity, leading to excessive synaptic accumulation particularly in the prefrontal cortex and contributing to ASD-like phenotypes.

A number of studies have found small differences in grey matter volume between poor comprehenders and poor or typically reading peers. However, a detailed quantification of specific cortical morphometric features and white matter integrity remains unexplored. Behavioral assessments and neuroimaging data from approximately 2,100 children (1,200 with imaging data), aged 8-16 were analyzed to determine if there is a distinct neuroanatomy associated with poor reading comprehension. Specifically, we computed grey matter cortical and subcortical volume, cortical thickness, and surface area, as well as white matter measures including mean diffusivity, fractional anisotropy, neurite orientation, and neurite density for poor comprehenders and compared to that of poor decoders and typical readers in this large and diverse sample. Additionally, given wide variation in approaches used to classify poor comprehenders in the field, we applied and compared three widely used methods for classifying poor comprehenders. Results revealed small but widespread white matter differences, but no grey matter differences between poor comprehenders and other readers. Specifically, poor comprehenders showed decreased white matter integrity (increased mean diffusivity and decreased neurite density) in tracts previously associated with reading, including the Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus and Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus, and in tracts that have been associated with cognitive performance such as the Uncinate Fasciculus and Frontal Aslant tract.

Methods: We performed Bayesian multi-trait colocalization (HyPrColoc) analysis of SZ and validated markers of structural MRI (bilateral cortical thickness, grey matter volume), IR (TG:HDL-C ratio, fasting insulin), and IL-6 signalling (IL-6, IL-6R, IL-6ST), at 137 trait-associated SNPs (GWAS p < 5x10^-8). in silico characterisation of candidate SNPs included protein (p)QTL gene set enrichment and developmental brain expression profiling in publicly available datasets. Results: Primary analysis identified colocalization between SZ and at least one trait from brain structure, IR, or IL-6 signalling at 6 loci. After sensitivity analysis, the SLC39A8 missense variant rs13107325 remained colocalized across SZ, bilateral cortical thickness, TG:HDL-C, and IL-6ST (PPcoloc = 0.93-0.99).

Reliably demonstrating this in utero using fMRI remains a very challenging problem due to a variety of MRI-adverse factors, including distant coil positioning and motion-induced magnetic field perturbations. Here, we introduce a novel approach to functional network analysis, called seed-based functional covariance modes (FCMs), which leverages inter-subject variability in connectivity between seed regions and the rest of the brain to infer whole-brain network configurations. We first applied the FCMs approach to neonatal data to benchmark it against group-level independent component factorisation - a standard in fMRI network analysis - and found a high degree of concordance between the results produced by the two methods. We then applied it to the fetal data, where the standard approach has consistently failed to reveal spatially distributed networks. For the first time, and despite fundamental differences in signal characteristics between fetal and neonatal data, we detected network-like patterns with high spatial correspondence to neonatal functional networks. In particular, the FCMs approach efficiently recovered interhemispheric connections, a landmark feature of neonatal functional networks. Systematic organisation of interhemispheric fetal networks was observed; they tended to cluster along the brain midline but also were present in lateral sensorimotor and temporal areas as well as cortical limbic territories in ventral orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole. By aligning fetal and neonatal connectomes, this study represents a crucial step towards supporting the biological veracity of observations made using fetal fMRI. Meanwhile, the concordance between FCMs and independent component factorisation in neonates prompts a re-evaluation of how inter-individual variability contributes to network structure inference in methods that ostensibly emphasise shared correlation patterns across subjects.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Despite recent evidence for the biological basis behind the existence and formation of such assemblies, computational models often fall short of showing how assemblies can be flexibly learned and combined to perform real-world computations. A prominent problem is 'catastrophic forgetting', where learning a new assembly can disrupt existing connectivity structure and lead to forgetting previously learned assemblies. We propose a biologically plausible computational model, where dendritic compartments (instead of neurons) are the loci for learning and inhibition gates learning in a dendrite-specific manner, to flexibly learn new stimuli without forgetting of old ones. By learning stable projections from one brain region into another and associations between different brain regions, we demonstrate how the proposed assembly framework implements the basic building blocks for diverse computations. In a visual-auditory association task, we demonstrate how the context-specific assembly computations can be used to correctly separate ambiguous stimuli based on their dendritic representations. Our models provide unique insights and predictions for how hierarchically connected brain areas use their biological components to implement flexible yet robust learning.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

The dentate gyrus (DG) is known to play a role in pattern recognition and spatial working memory. However, the role of the DG in different stages of long-term spatial memory is poorly understood. Moreover, the roles of the predominant interneuron subtypes within the DG - somatostatin-expressing (SST+) and parvalbumin-expressing (PV+) - in different stages of memory processing are unknown. We tested how chemogenetic manipulation of DG SST+ and PV+ interneurons in mice influences the encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of hippocampus-dependent object-location memory (OLM). We find that activation of DG SST+ interneurons impairs both OLM encoding and retrieval, dramatically suppresses DG granule cell cFos expression, and (in the case of encoding) suppresses downstream CA1 network activity. Among individual mice, the degree of DG granule cell suppression is proportional to the extent of SST+ interneuron activation, and predicts the extent of OLM deficits. In striking contrast, PV+ interneuron activation selectively disrupts encoding, but not retrieval, of OLM, and minimally impacts DG or downstream hippocampal network activity. These findings demonstrate that regulation of the DG network by SST+ and PV+ interneurons differentially contributes to the various stages of spatial memory processing, and suggest that distinct network mechanisms are engaged in the hippocampus during each processing stage.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

These two indicators are combined into an E-A functional index, which we demonstrate as an effective screening strategy for identifying antibodies with strict antigen sensitivity and specificity. Using this E-A functional screening method, we successfully discovered antibodies or nanobodies targeting cell-surface tumor antigens and neoantigens presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA). These antibodies exhibited potent anti-tumor efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, converting these antibodies into chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and bispecific antibodies also induced T cell activation and tumor killing.

While it has been hypothesized for some time that disease burdens increased with the shift to agricultural and urbanized lifestyles, direct evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Here, we capitalize on the accumulation of ancient genomic data to study changes in disease burden in human populations over the past 12,000 years. We investigated changes in genetic diversity and balancing selection in two distinct geographical and cultural centers in Southwest Eurasia and Eastern Asia, and found that not only is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) the genomic region with the most substantial increases in diversity in terms of enrichment of genes and rates of increase, but that the rates of changes for individual genes are highly correlated between the two cultural centers, indicating similar selection pressures. We identify periods of time with substantial peaks in MHC diversity increase that primarily correspond to periods with settlement intensification, increased connectivity, and the expansion of animal domestication, which suggest that the most intensive disease burden occurred following the transition to sedentary lifestyle but prior to urbanization. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach in uncovering the interplay between cultural shifts and selection, and provide strong support to the hypothesis that the levels of disease burden have substantially increased in recent prehistory following changes in lifestyle, connectivity and the introduction of domesticated animals.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Pairing of reward or punishment with activation of EP co-releasing neurons makes EP-LHb synapses relatively more inhibitory or excitatory, respectively. Synaptic sign switching modulates downstream dopaminergic signaling, correlates with recent dopamine updates, and contributes to reinforcement learning.

By modulating the synaptic strength of only a few neurons in local neighborhoods, we uncovered high-impact locations which can start, stop, extend, gate, and redirect sequences.

Here, we show that the \"signalling by nuclear receptors\" (SNR) pathway is detected in the whole blood of TB patients and that its expression correlates with disease severity. Accordingly, we also show that the activation of the LXR pathway progressively increases in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-infected C57BL/6 and C3HeB/FeJ mice. Pharmacologic activation of LXR, specifically at the chronic stage of infection, improved infection outcomes and significantly prolonged the survival of the highly susceptible C3HeB/FeJ mice. Common to both mouse models and to in vitro macrophage infections, LXR activation enhanced bacterial control together with an increase in extracellular cholesterol levels. We propose that progressive LXR activation is required to fine-tune host cholesterol availability during M. tuberculosis infections and restrict access to this nutrient during chronic stages of infections. Collectively, we identify the SNR pathway as a potential biomarker of TB severity and timely LXR activation as a candidate host-directed therapy.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

M.; Macdonald, S. J.", "abstract": "In Drosophila melanogaster, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping have often yielded seemingly contradictory results, with GWAS typically suggesting highly polygenic architectures while QTL mapping identifies fewer loci of larger effect. We investigated this discrepancy using a published mapping study that contrasted pools of control flies with pools of flies representing the most zinc chloride-resistant larvae. The dataset provided a unique opportunity to compare three distinct analytical approaches: an X-QTL mapping strategy based on inferring known founder haplotype frequencies, a SNP-by-SNP GWAS using directly ascertained SNP counts, and a SNP-by-SNP GWAS using imputed SNP counts derived from estimated haplotype frequencies. Our analysis revealed that X-QTL and imputed SNP approaches uncovered a relatively simple genetic architecture dominated by several major-effect loci. In contrast, the traditional SNP-by-SNP GWAS suggested a highly polygenic trait with numerous small-effect loci dispersed throughout the genome. We demonstrate that this apparent discrepancy primarily stems from the limited statistical power of the SNP-by-SNP GWAS approach when applied to pooled sequencing data. Despite ~700X sequence coverage and greater than 3000 flies per treatment, the inferred polygenic architecture under the SNP-by-SNP approach appears to simply be an artifact of insufficient power to detect major effect loci. Through simulations, we illustrate that reliably detecting subtle allele frequency differences between pools requires substantially larger sample sizes and higher sequencing coverage than typically employed in current studies.

Methods: Female C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat high-sugar (HFHS) (45% fat and 10% sugar) diet and High fat diet (60% fat) for 21 weeks to investigate the effects on metabolic health and reproductive health. Mice were assessed for body weight, abdominal circumference, glucose tolerance (OGTT) and estrous cyclicity. At the end of the study biochemical analysis was done on isolated serum and, histological assessment of organs including liver and ovarian tissue was done to score for cystic follicle development and steatosis respectively. Results: Mice on the HFHS diet did not gain weight but developed dyslipidaemia, abnormal liver enzyme levels and severe hepatic steatosis. They did not show impaired glucose tolerance and did not develop any PCOS-like ovarian morphology indicating hepatic metabolic disturbances without significant impact on reproductive health. In contrast, mice on the 60% high-fat diet (HFD) showed marginal increase in body weight and developed altered estrous cyclicity and PCOS-like ovarian morphology. They also exhibited impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, confirming a metabolic disturbance associated with PCOS.

Most rodent studies investigating these topics use only males, and assess salt or stress separately. Here, we used adult female and male mice to investigate how the combination of access to food high in salt (4% NaCl, w/w) and experiencing an acute stressor interact to affect levels of a proxy measure for neuroinflammation (Iba1). We hypothesized eating salty food and experiencing stress would each individually augment neuroinflammation, and their combination would be additive. Further, we anticipated salty food consumption would increase active stress coping behaviors, and that all of these effects would be enhanced in female mice. Over 4 or 8 weeks, we further evaluated how mice responded to choice access to low (0.4%) and high salt food simultaneously. Our hypothesis that mice across sexes would eventually prefer high over low salt food was supported, while our expectations regarding neuroinflammation and stress did not consistently align with our findings. Instead, we found modest changes in passive coping behaviors driven by our choice condition, unanticipated reductions in sham stress neuroinflammation by high salt in brain region- and biological sex-specific patterns after 4 weeks, and distinct sex- and salt-selective increases in swim stress neuroinflammation after 8 weeks. Though some of our results were unexpected, they include multiple novel and translationally relevant outcomes. Mice willingly choose to eat saltier food over time, akin to people, and this could sex-specifically decrease (females) or augment (males) passive coping stress strategies while eliciting distinctive stress- and brain region-dependent neuroinflammatory patterns over time.

L.", "abstract": "Background: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is among the leading causes of death from an infectious agent among children worldwide. Children represent a particularly vulnerable population due to the greater challenges in diagnosis and the higher risk of progression to severe forms of the disease. However, whether different pediatric outcomes relate to distinct immunologic responses remains incompletely understood. Emerging data suggest that Mtb-specific humoral immune responses represent a correlate of protection against Mtb both following natural infection and vaccination. Methods: To determine if immune profiles can distinguish children across the spectrum from Mtb infection to TB disease, as well as children with TB from non-TB lower respiratory tract infection, we mapped the humoral immune response across a panel of 4 dozen Mtb antigens across children presenting with symptoms of active TB (ATB), children with evidence of latent TB infection (LTBI) and children exhibiting non-TB lower respiratory tract infection (non-TB LRTI). Using a custom Luminex assay, Mtb-specific antibody subclass/isotype, Fc receptor (FcR) binding profiles, and functions were profiled across the pediatric groups. Findings: A robust humoral immune response was observed in children with active TB compared to non-TB LRTI, marked by a strong IgA response, that exhibited high Fc-alpha-R binding. Conversely, children with LTBI uniquely elicited Mtb-specific antibodies with enhanced opsinophagocytic Fc-gamma-R2A binding, as well as a higher capacity to activate NK cells and neutrophils. Interpretation: There are significant differences in humoral immune profiles across the landscape of pediatric TB, potentially contributing to differential mycobacterial control, and highlighting biomarkers that could guide both diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Waterfowl, such as ducks or geese, can be asymptomatic and act as silent carriers of H5N1, making detection harder and increasing the risk of further transmission, potentially leading to significant economic losses. For backyard hobby farmers, passive reporting is a common HPAI detection strategy. We aim to quantify the effectiveness of this strategy by simulating the spread of H5N1 in a mixed-species, small-population backyard flock. Quantities such as detection time and undetected burden of infection in various scenarios are compared. Our results indicate that the presence of ducks can lead to a higher risk of an outbreak and a higher burden of infection. If most ducks within a flock are resistant to H5N1, detection can be significantly delayed. We find that within-flock infection dynamics can heavily depend on the species composition in backyard farms. Ducks, in particular, can pose a higher risk of transmission within a flock or between flocks.

This study introduces a data-driven framework combining dynamical system reconstruction (DSR) with model predictive control (MPC) to infer optimal control policies for transitioning between resting and sad mood brain states, based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Using generative DSR models trained on fMRI data from participants with a remitted major depressive disorder (rMDD) and matched healthy controls from a resting state period and a sad mood induction task, we reconstruct nonlinear brain dynamics and derive region-specific control strategies for transitioning from resting to sad mood states. Our results demonstrate that small brain regions, such as the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), exhibit higher controllability, requiring less energy to drive state transitions. Notably, rMDD group shows reduced control energy demands and stronger neural connectivity, particularly relating to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)-hippocampal pathways, suggesting heightened susceptibility to relapse into negative mood states. These findings highlight the potential of closed-loop control approaches to uncover mechanistic insights into RNT and inform targeted interventions for mood disorders in the future.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we characterize whole-brain patterns of cellular interactions that spatially align with tissue damage across 13 neurodegenerative conditions, including early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD, LOAD), presenilin-1 mutations (PS1), frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). By integrating spatial gene expression with structural MRI data, we created over 1,000 whole-brain maps of ligand-receptor interactions. Multivariate analysis revealed three principal axes of cell-cell communication underlying brain tissue vulnerability. The first axis involved neuron-astrocyte-microglia interactions, explaining atrophy patterns shared by frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease subtypes. Moreover, the first axis was enriched with genes involved in regulation or spreading of amyloid beta/tau and/or Alzheimer's disease risk. Two complementary axes involving neurons, endothelial cells, and astrocytes explained patterns specific to PS1 and PD. Notably, we confirmed that cell-cell interactions identified for LOAD were also associated with frontal cortex atrophy in 375 participants from an independent database. These findings reveal both distinctive and shared molecular signaling pathways underlying tissue vulnerability across neurodegenerative disorders, clarifying disease mechanisms and highlighting potential cellular targets for therapeutic interventions.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

The pathogenic mechanisms of most class B1 mutations are uncharacterized. We generated new animal models of RHO-associated RP to examine RHO expression, localization, glycosylation, and the influence of light and chromophore binding on RD. Methods: We generated transgenic X. laevis expressing wildtype or mutant human RHO transgenes. Confocal images were used to evaluate RD and trafficking. Immunoassays were used to quantify RD and investigate RHO glycosylation. Results: We created X. laevis models of 26 different forms of RHO-associated RP. Most mutations caused RD, with the exception of those at residue R135 and G101. Many variants did not alter RHO localization. Multiple class B1-associated RHO mutants induced light-dependent RD, suggesting light is the environmental influence associated with the class B1 phenotype. However, the degeneration associated with two partially ER-retained class B1 mutants (S22R and D190G) was not mitigated by dark rearing. P23H and S176F constituted a distinct subclass associated with inner segment retention and proteolytic cleavage. Conclusions: Many RHO mutations do not substantially alter RHO localization or glycosylation. The exceptions we identified are P23H and S176F, which dramatically mislocalize, and constitute a distinct category of proteolytically-cleaved misfolding variants. L31Q and T58R induce RD by mechanisms similar to glycosylation-deficient variants, despite lack of glycosylation defects. Intermediate phenotypes indicate at least one previously undescribed mechanism for class B1 RP pathogenesis.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

In this study, we show that H2S, a product of host and microbial metabolism, profoundly influences the threshold for HIF-dependent hypoxia-sensing by increasing intracellular O2. The dose-dependent destabilization of HIF by H2S is inversely correlated with sulfide quinone oxidoreductase, which oxidizes sulfide in the mitochondrion. Hypoxia sensors provide a quantitative estimate of the magnitude of H2S-induced perturbation. The O2 concentration in cells grown in a 2% O2 atmosphere is sensed as 5 or 15 % O2 in the presence of 25 or 100 ppm H2S, respectively. Sustained exposure to H2S elicits the hallmarks of hyperoxia-associated cytotoxicity, including loss of Fe-S proteins in cellular and murine models. H2S thus emerges as a powerful regulator of O2 sensing and signaling with possible implications for dysregulation in O2 toxicity diseases.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

J.; Chen, Y.; Huebner, B.; Ludwig, A.", "abstract": "The Hippo pathway controls cell growth, proliferation and differentiation, and is frequently deregulated in cancers. YAP, the central transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo pathway, is suppressed by the canonical Hippo kinases and several poorly characterized non-canonical mechanisms. YAP also interacts with the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, yet how this crosstalk is regulated is not well understood. Here we show that Homer scaffolding proteins act downstream of the Crumbs polarity complex to promote YAP/TEAD and canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in epithelial and cancer cells. We demonstrate that Homers via their EVH1 domains interact directly with the Crumbs complex protein PatJ as well as with the NDR kinase scaffolding protein Furry-like (FRYL). FRYL acts antagonistically to Homers in controlling YAP/TEAD signaling but cooperates with Homers to promote Wnt/beta-catenin signaling output. Intriguingly, live and fixed cell imaging, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching, and electron microscopy revealed that all three Homer proteins form cytoplasmic biomolecular condensates with unique ultrastructural and material properties. These condensates effectively sequestered PatJ, FRYL, NDR, YAP, and beta-catenin, with PatJ and FRYL exerting opposing effects on the condensate's properties. Finally, in colorectal cancer cells, Homers enhance YAP and Wnt signaling and promote cell migration, suggesting a tumor-promoting function for Homers. Overall, our findings suggest that Homers coordinate YAP-Wnt signaling crosstalk through cytoplasmic phase separation, linking polarity cues to transcriptional regulation.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

When RNAPII stalls on transcription-blocking lesions, the transcription-coupled DNA repair pathway is activated to remove the DNA damage. Following DNA repair, efficient transcription restart depends on the PAF1 elongation complex (PAF1C). PAF1C contributes to deposition of transcription-associated histone marks, including H2B-K120Ub, H3K4me3 and H3K79me2. These marks are enriched at actively transcribed genes and have been associated with regulation of post-repair transcription restart. Here, we show that the H2B-K120 E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF20/RNF40, the H3K4-methyltransferase SET1/COMPASS complex, and the H3K79-methyltransferase DOT1L are dispensable for transcription restart. Moreover, levels of H2B-K120Ub and H3K4me3 do not correlate with transcription restoration following DNA damage. Additionally, we observe that, unlike PAF1, the dissociable PAF1C subunit RTF1, while stimulating H2B-K120Ub and H3K4me3, does not play a role in transcription restart. Together, these data suggest that transcription restoration after DNA damage is stimulated by the PAF1C elongation complex, independently of transcription-associated histone mark deposition.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Unexpectedly, we found that deleting RagA/B in rTECs, despite inhibiting mTORC1, triggers renal cystogenesis and kidney failure. We identify TFEB as the key driver of cystogenesis downstream of RagA/B loss and show that Rag GTPases, rather than mTORC1, are the primary suppressors of TFEB in vivo. We further highlight increased nuclear TFEB as a shared feature of several RCD models, whereas differences in mTORC1 activity may explain variable mTORC1 inhibitor efficacy. Finally, we provide evidence that nuclear TFEB, rather than mTORC1 activation, is a more consistent biomarker of cyst-lining epithelial cells in ADPKD.

This export is vital for parasite survival and pathogenesis, making PMV an attractive target for antimalarial drug development. Peptidomimetic inhibitors designed to mimic the natural substrate of PMV have demonstrated potent parasite-killing activity by blocking protein export. While these compounds have been instrumental in validating PMV as a bona fide antimalarial target, inconsistencies between their biochemical potency and cellular activity have raised questions regarding their precise mechanism of action. In this study, we employed chemoproteomic approaches, including solvent induced protein precipitation (SIP) and intact-cell thermal PISA profiling, to demonstrate PMV target engagement by the peptidomimetics. To further support these findings, we generated parasite lines exhibiting reduced sensitivity to peptidomimetics. Through whole-genome sequencing of these parasite lines, a single nucleotide variant (SNV) within the pmv gene was revealed. This mutation was later validated using reverse genetics, confirming its role in mediating resistance. Together, these data provide strong evidence that the peptidomimetics exert their antimalarial activity by directly targeting PMV. These findings further support the potential of PMV as a validated and promising target for future antimalarial drug development.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Ki-67 localises to the chromatin-nucleolus interface, where its depletion induces nucleolar rounding and reduces chromatin enrichment within and around the nucleolus. This effect is driven by amphiphilic properties conferred by two distinct affinity domains separated by a spacer. Given that chromatin loss is a common feature of rounded nucleoli in our screen, and acute chromatin digestion also induces rounding, we propose that the chromatin environment in and around the nucleolus plays a key role in determining nucleolar shape.

Here, we build upon the earlier studies from the Cooke lab to quantify the size of this cardiac reserve using fluorescence imaging of Cy3-ATP directly in myofibrils. This approach employs a pulse-chase method and exploits the high permeability of isolated myofibrils to monitor nucleotide release in situ. By preserving sarcomeric architecture while enabling rapid reagent exchange, this method bridges the gap between complex single-molecule imaging and traditional stopped-flow bulk assays using MANT-ATP.

Peripheral vision loss observers produced significantly less informative descriptions than both central vision loss and control participants, particularly for social interaction scenes, suggesting that peripheral vision is critical for rapid extraction of scene semantics. In contrast, central vision loss primarily disrupted oculomotor behavior, including increased saccade amplitudes, delayed saccade initiation, and reduced inter-subject fixation consistency.

DNA synthesis labeling reveals that zeocin disrupts replication and triggers de novo reparative synthesis in select non-dividing tissues. Pulse-wash experiments demonstrate that even transient damage to dividing gut cells irreversibly exhausts their replicative capacity, leading to midgut failure and animal death, despite systemic induction of DNA repair genes.

This phenotype models the situation in female DMD carriers, and dystrophic muscle in which dystrophin has been incompletely restored by partially-effective experimental therapeutics. Total dystrophin expression increased in aged (60-week-old) mdx52-Xist{Delta}hs mice relative to 6-week-old adults, suggestive of an accumulation of dystrophin-expressing myonuclei through positive selection, although this was insufficient to resolve sarcolemmal dystrophin patchiness. Nevertheless, compared to mice expressing no dystrophin, non-uniformly-distributed dystrophin was protective against pathology-related muscle turnover in an expression-level-dependent manner in both adult and aged mdx52-Xist{Delta}hs mice. Systematic classification of isolated mdx52-Xist{Delta}hs myofibers revealed profound differences associated with central nucleation, with dystrophin found to be translationally repressed in centrally-nucleated myofibers and myofiber segments. These findings have important implications for the development of dystrophin restoration therapies.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Knowledge on the fate of internalized EVs, especially their capacity to fuse with target cell membranes and deliver luminal cargo, is limited. Currently available EV-cargo delivery assays are indirect and thus unlikely to uncover molecular players and conditions that specifically control the EV-fusion step. Here, we present a novel live-cell imaging assay for detection of EV-binding, -uptake, and -fusion in time and space. We employed the SunTag system for exceptional signal amplification. EV-donor cells were engineered to tag the luminal EV-membrane with a fluorescent label coupled to SunTag peptides. Recipient cells express fluorescent single-chain anti-SunTag antibody (STAb), which binds EV-enclosed SunTag upon its cytosolic exposure. Using SunTagged EVs carrying fusogen VSV-G, we visualize the EV-fusion process, quantify fusion kinetics and efficiency, and determine subcellular localization of fusion events. We term this methodology EV-FUSIM (Extracellular Vesicle Fusion Spatiotemporal Imaging Method). In the future, this technology can support identification of fusogenic EV-subsets, as well as molecular players and drugs that modulate EV-fusion, without confounding effects of post-fusion processes. This will extend knowledge on EV-biology and can aid in the engineering of EVs that efficiently deliver intraluminal therapeutic payloads.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Using gentle, column-free purification combined with single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we have identified a previously unrecognized planar dimeric form of bovine ATP synthase exhibiting minimal membrane bending. This planar dimer is characterized structurally by antiparallel arrangement of two ATP synthase complexes linked by a straight conformation of the inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), a sharp contrast to the kinked IF1 observed in tetrameric assemblies. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm that transitioning between straight and kinked IF1 conformations occurs without significant energetic barriers.

In this article, we argue that counting subpopulations can be a misleading proxy for identifying the number of behavioral modes accessible to individual cells within a system. We show that definitions of behavioral modes based on deterministic modeling can fail when fluctuations in a system's state---or noise---become significant. In such cases, peaks in the probability distribution---emerging from stochastic descriptions---are often interpreted as substitutes for deterministically defined stable modes. However, we demonstrate that this interpretation can break down: it is possible to construct counterexamples in which two subpopulations arise from a system that supports only a single mode of behavior, driven by non-equilibrium transient dynamics. Better understanding the role of noise in transient biological randomness may allow for the discovery of novel mechanisms of regulation that are not apparent in steady state behaviors.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

We identify alanine as a critical metabolite that confers metabolic flexibility to support differentiation. TGF-{beta} increases alanine by activating both its synthesis and import in normal and IPF lung fibroblasts. Alanine is synthesized primarily by GPT2, which is regulated by a glutamine-glutamate--ketoglutarate axis. Inhibiting GPT2 depletes alanine and suppresses TGF-{beta}-induced expression of -SMA and COL1A1, an effect reversed by alanine supplementation. We also identify SLC38A2 as a key transporter of both alanine and glutamine that is upregulated by TGF-{beta} and alanine deprivation. Together, SLC38A2 and GPT2 activities converge to maintain intracellular alanine levels to support myofibroblast differentiation. Mechanistically, alanine deficiency suppresses glycolysis and depletes tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, while supplementation provides carbon and nitrogen for intracellular glutamate and proline biosynthesis, particularly in the absence of glutamine.

Thirty-two cows were exposed to two tests: a visual preference test, during which two silent videos were shown simultaneously - each displaying either a familiar or an unfamiliar human face - and a cross-modal test, during which the videos were accompanied by either a congruent or incongruent voice. During the visual preference test, cows looked significantly longer at the video showing the unfamiliar person (p = 0.025). In the cross-modal test, they looked significantly longer at the video that was congruent with the voice being played (p = 0.021). These two results show that cows are able to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar individuals and form cross-modal representations of these people.

M.", "abstract": "When foraging for resources, animals must often sample many options that yield reward with different probabilities. In such scenarios, many animals have been shown to exhibit ``matching'', an empirical behavioral observation in which the fraction of rewarded samples is the same across all options. While previous work has shown that matching can be optimal in environments with diminishing returns, this condition is not sufficient to determine optimality. Furthermore, while diminishing returns naturally arise when resources in the environment deplete and take time to be replenished, the specific form of diminishing returns depends on the temporal structure and statistics of the replenishment process. Here, we explore how these environmental properties affect whether matching is optimal. By considering an agent that samples different options with fixed sampling rates, we derive the probability of collecting a reward as a function of these sampling rates for different types of environments, and we analytically determine the conditions under which the optimal sampling-rate policy exhibits matching. When all options are governed by the same replenishment dynamics, we find that optimality gives rise to matching across a wide range of environments. However, when these dynamics differ across options, the optimal policy can deviate from matching. In such cases, the rank-ordering of observed reward probabilities depends only on the qualitative nature of the replenishment process, but not on the specific replenishment rates. As a result, the optimal policy can exhibit under- or over-matching depending on how rewarding the different options are. We use this result to identify environmental settings under which performance differs substantially between matching and optimality. Finally, we show how fluctuations in these replenishment rates--which can represent either environmental stochasticity or the agent's internal uncertainty about the environment--can accentuate deviations between optimality and matching. Together, these findings deepen our understand of the relationship between environmental variability and behavioral optimality, and they provide testable experimental predictions across a wide range of environmental settings.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Ants may benefit from having more attributes differentiating potential nests only if they can quickly and accurately assess all possible attributes and make well-informed decisions. Here, we asked if the number and type of attributes differentiating potential nests affect the accuracy and latency of colony decision-making. We used pair-wise tests, where potential nests differed in 1-3 attributes, with one nest within the pair considered less optimal. We recorded the nest the colonies chose and the time it took to make the decision. We found that the degree of difference did not affect the decision-making latency, suggesting that ant colonies searching for a new nest might be constrained temporally when selecting a new nest site. We also found that accuracy increased with the number of attributes, particularly when nest brightness was manipulated, indicating that increasing the number of attributes may help facilitate nest-site selection.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "'The pathogenesis of Huntington's disease is still incompletely understood, despite the remarkable advances in identifying the molecular effects of the Htt mutation in this disease. When we focus on movement disorders, clinical studies offer us some hints about this issue. Human studies employing positron emission tomography have identified a reduction in phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) as the earliest event in the brain of patients with Huntington's disease, which occurs about 25 years before symptom onset. A PDE10A mutation is also known to cause childhood-onset chorea. GNAL encodes the olfactory type G-protein  subunit (Golf), strongly expressed in the striatum, and its mutation causes familial dystonia. PDE10A and Golf are both critical regulators of cyclic AMP and are abundant in striatal spiny projection neurons. These findings suggest that maintaining cyclic AMP levels in the striatum might be an essential target for the pathogenesis of movement disorders such as chorea and dystonia. Why and how these changes in the striatum cause movement disorder are still a mystery. Here we suggest that a key might be evaluating these messenger systems in light of the circuit-level compartmental organization of the striatum, in which there is particular vulnerability of the striosome compartment. We developed machine learning algorithms to define with high precision and reproducibility the borders of striosomes in the brains of q175 Huntington's disease model mice from 3-12 months of age. We demonstrate that multiple molecules including Golf, PDE10A, dopamine D1 and D2 receptors, adenosine 2A receptors, and mu-opioid receptors differentially change their expression patterns in striosomes across ages by comparison with their expression patterns in the matrix compartment. An early and pronounced differential vulnerability of striosomes has been demonstrated in studies of post-mortem Huntington's brains.

Although behavior accelerates with temperature, spatial parameters, such as bout distance and turn angle, remain stable. This invariance results from coordinated adjustments in tail beat frequency and movement duration. Brain-wide calcium imaging revealed that behavioral temporal scaling is mirrored at the level of single neurons. A simple rate model showed that temperature-dependent changes in neural time constants can account for compensatory tail dynamics, enabling stability without active regulation. These findings suggest that neural temporal scaling can preserve performance under diffuse temperature fluctuations, supporting robust behavior in natural environments.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

They are implicated in a wide range of cognitive processes and proposed as a core mechanism for brain communication. Nonetheless, detecting genuine neural oscillations remains a methodological challenge, particularly due to the difficulty of distinguishing them from aperiodic background activity. To identify episodes of oscillatory activity directly at their sources, we developed pBOSC, which extends the BOSC (Better OSCillation detection) family of algorithms. Consistent with existing approaches, pBOSC detects oscillatory episodes that exceed both a defined power threshold and a minimum duration criterion. In pBOSC, however, the detection of oscillatory episodes also relies on identifying peaks (i.e., local maxima) in the power spectra as well as throughout the brain volume. Using a series of simulated signals, we tested the ability of pBOSC to detect and localize oscillations across multiple scenarios. Our results show that most oscillatory episodes were accurately detected at their sources, achieving around 95% accuracy under optimal conditions (i.e., high signal-to-noise ratio, lower frequency, and longer oscillation duration). In addition, we validated pBOSCs performance on real resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. By extracting the natural frequency of each brain voxel from the detected oscillatory episodes, we observed a topographic distribution consistent with previous work. In conclusion, pBOSC offers a novel approach for identifying oscillatory activity in electrophysiological signals.

We identified five broad cellular lineages in SCTs: stroma, epithelia, endothelia, neuroectoderm, and immune. The transcriptomes and lineage compositions showed significant heterogeneity, which offer a framework for future molecular stratification. SCTs are thought to originate from and be propagated by pluripotent cells, notably however, we did not detect these populations. Among female tumors, a subset of cells exhibited biallelic expression of X-linked genes, consistent with X-inactivation failure or reactivation of the once inactivated X-chromosome. These biallelic cells were enriched for developmental and neuronal programs, whereas cells with single-allelic X-chromosome preferentially expressed immune-related genes. Biallelic X-chromosome activation, which can occur only in female cells, may result in transcriptomic features that favor survival of tumor cells, contributing to the sex bias of SCTs.

We measured the optimal temperature of photosynthesis (Topt), the assimilation at optimal temperature (Aopt), the thermal breath of photosynthesis (T80), the respiration at 25{degrees}C (R25), the temperature sensitivity of respiration (Q10), and simulated the whole-plant carbon budget. For all species, Topt, Aopt, and T80 increased with warming, while R25 decreased in the native species and Q10 decreased in the invasive species only. Consequently, acclimation enhanced the carbon budget of the invasive and native plants in the warm and hot sites. The invasive palm had a similar or lower acclimation capacity than other species and a lower but constant carbon budget across the European temperature gradient. Our work reveals that not all invasive plants exhibit greater photosynthetic plasticity than native ones, suggesting that temperature-driven enhancement of their carbon budget may play a limited role in future invasion processes.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Given the massive distracting information in which a target is embedded, the ability to manage distractions becomes the determinant of efficient information processing. Fortunately, the visual world is not entirely random; prior knowledge about targets and distractors can guide strategic attentional allocation. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this process remain incompletely understood. Using a binocular rivalry paradigm with flickering stimuli, we examined the rhythmic neural dynamics modulating target and distractor processing. Participants were cued in advance about the feature of the target or distractor on each trial. There was a behavioral enhancement in the target-cueing condition but no significant benefit or cost was observed in the distractor-cueing condition. Single-trial analyses showed that the absence of distractor-related cost was driven by reactive inhibition control, characterized by pronounced frontal theta activity that reduced the sensory gain of the distractor during rivalry. Additionally, distractor cues produced stronger alpha activity over parietal areas, reflecting enhanced attentional gating. This gating mechanism subserves the segregation of competing visual inputs, stabilizing perception by facilitating target identification and isolating distractors, without directly modulating sensory gain. These findings reveal that resolving competition between rivalrous stimuli is achieved through complementary neural mechanisms of reactive direct inhibition and proactive indirect gating, mediated by temporally dissociable theta and alpha oscillations.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

While this is a valid approach for understanding the basic phenomena, both the combination of many different datasets and the average analysis can confound details in the response of the nerve fiber. To improve computational models of electrically stimulated nerve fibers further, we propose an optimization procedure that can fit the parameters of a neuron model to the response of a single nerve fiber to pulse-train stimulation. We show that in this way, the model can reproduce a wide variety of fiber responses of electrically stimulated auditory nerve fibers of guinea pigs in a remarkably detailed way on a scale of less than 1 ms. We analyze and discuss the certainty and generalizability of the parameter sets thus exposed. The model parameters found by the optimization procedure can then form the basis for a detailed fiber-by-fiber analysis, which we illustrate by a correlation analysis of the predicted phenomena (e.g., spike latency and refractory period) in the fiber response.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

L.; Kamalian, P.; Lara, N.; Fischer, E. S.; Bernardes, G. J. L.; Quijano-Rubio, A.; Silva, D.-A.", "abstract": "Bioluminescent systems are widely used as molecular reporters in life sciences due to their low background, broad dynamic range, and the key advantage that they do not require external excitation. However, natural luciferases often lack the brightness, stability, and long-lasting light emission needed to support a wide range of high-sensitivity applications. Here, we describe our next-generation luciferase solution: LuxSit Pro and its substrate, Luxterazine (LTZ). LuxSit Pro is a de novo luciferase optimized for steady brightness and structural stability through an iterative combination of computational and experimental methods. Composed of only 117 amino acids, LuxSit Pro is currently the smallest highest-performing known luciferase, exhibiting exceptional brightness and biochemical stability with robust recombinant expression in both mammalian and bacterial systems. Notably, LuxSit Pro was deliberately designed devoid of lysine and cysteine residues which enormously expands its potential applications. This property renders the reporter largely resistant to post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination and also enables site-directed chemical modifications, as lysines or cysteines can be reintroduced at specific sites to serve as chemical handles for augmenting or adapting the enzyme function. The novel synthetic substrate, Luxterazine (LTZ), is a compound that enables LuxSit Pro to deliver bright, steady, blue light emission (~490 nm) and offers improved solubility compared to existing Coelenterazine analogs. Finally, we also developed LuxSit sPro, a highly sensitive two-component complementation system for the quantitative detection of molecular interactions. The broad potential applications of LuxSit Pro and sPro, in combination with Luxterazine, are poised to drive the development of next-generation reporters and biosensor systems for the research and in vitro diagnostics fields.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Recent work on the Amazon used decades of satellite-derived vegetation data to reveal increases in generic early-warning signals of a bifurcation-induced tipping point, which were most pronounced in areas with less rainfall and closer to human activity. Here, we extend this approach to Borneo and include novel considerations to assess if, when and how rapidly resilience loss has accelerated, and whether that acceleration has any relationship with biodiversity. We detected a direct signal of resilience loss through the critical slowing down of Bornean rainforest's response to perturbations, which was observed through rising lag-1 autocorrelation and variance of long-term satellite-sensed vegetation data. We find Bornean rainforest lost resilience over our full study period (from 1991-2016), with a marked increase in the rate of loss from 2006. Resilience loss was most severe and accelerated earlier in subregions with lower precipitation, lower biodiversity, higher temperature and higher human activity, although this pattern was disrupted post-2006 since when resilience loss has been faster in areas with higher precipitation and lower human activity. Overall, we provide evidence of Bornean rainforest resilience loss, underscoring the urgent need for ecosystem conservation and climate change mitigation within Borneo and worldwide.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

To date, research on such trait-mediated indirect effects of parasites has focused on non-adaptive changes to host behavior, but adaptive sickness behaviors, such as self-medication, could also indirectly affect community composition and even the evolution of \"medicinal\" traits in lower trophic levels. Here, we used interactions among the parasite Crithidia bombi, the bumble bee host Bombus impatiens, and Monarda fistulosa, a bee-pollinated plant with multiple chemotypes (genetically determined chemical phenotypes), to experimentally test whether parasite infection influences pollinator foraging, pollination success, and female plant reproduction differentially for medicinal vs. non-medicinal chemotypes. Compounds from three Monarda chemotypes reduced Crithidia infection intensity in bees (thymol, carvacrol, and 1,8-cineole; hereafter medicinal chemotypes), while two others did not ((R)-(-)-linalool and geraniol; hereafter non-medicinal chemotypes), compared to control sucrose solutions. We found evidence for self-medication in tent foraging choice assays: infected bees preferred medicinal chemotypes while uninfected bees foraged indiscriminately, leading to differences in pollen receipt. Crithidia infection had weak but compounding chemotype-specific effects on seed production, germination rate, and offspring chemotype, such that pollination by infected bees resulted in a 57% increase in the proportion of medicinal plants in the F1 generation compared to pollination by uninfected bees. Self-medicating behavior can have differential effects on the reproduction of medicinal vs. non-medicinal plants, suggesting that pollinator parasites may act as agents of selection on the phytochemistry of floral rewards.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Their ability to replicate, compete against each other, and eradicate target cell populations is usually understood through a number of `life history parameters', traditionally measured by population-level assays, which implicitly average the parameter's value across a large number of infection events. Recent experiments suggest that bacteriophage life history parameters are subject to considerable heterogeneity, raising the question of whether experimental and modelling efforts that do not account for this variability may overlook important factors in phage's behaviour, competitive fitness or therapeutic viability. Here, using agent-based simulations, we investigate the importance of stochasticity in lysis time and burst size of lytic bacteriophages in two common laboratory competition experiments: serial passage of well-mixed populations and plaque expansion across a bacterial lawn. We find that a phage's analytic growth rate in isolation can be a poor predictor of its fitness advantage in simulated competition experiments. Specifically, when lysis times are tightly distributed, we identify a novel effect we name ``population resonance\", through which a bacteriophage can display a significant fitness advantage over a competitor with a much greater growth rate in isolation. Our simulations also show that both serial passage and plaque expansion reward variability in lysis time more than expected, by increasing the phage resilience when resources are scarce.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

The flightless bush-cricket Anonconotus italoaustriacus, endemic to the Southern Limestone Alps (SLA) and the eastern Central Alps (CA), provides an ideal model to study the evolutionary and refugial dynamics of endemic alpine arthropods. Using genomic SNP data, we employed phylogenetic analyses, Bayesian clustering, and demographic modeling to investigate the species' evolutionary history and its refugial dynamics. Our results support a scenario of survival in multiple peripheral refugia during the Last Glacial Period (LGP; 115-11.7 ka), with populations in the southern SLA and eastern CA exhibiting the highest private allelic richness. Postglacial recolonization of interior alpine regions occurred exclusively from refugia on the southeastern margin of the SLA, most likely facilitated by open habitat corridors along transversal valleys. In contrast, populations in the southern SLA exhibited long-term isolation and distributional stasis, emphasizing the importance of small, stable refugia in preserving genetic diversity. We propose that polyandry, a reproductive strategy of A. italoaustriacus, contributed to its resilience by maintaining high genetic diversity despite repeated bottlenecks and habitat fragmentation. These findings highlight the importance of integrating evolutionary history into conservation strategies, particularly for alpine endemics with fragmented distributions. Protecting both long-term stable refugia and dynamic evolutionary hotspots is critical for the conservation of A. italoaustriacus and other high-altitude arthropods in the face of ongoing environmental change.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

High field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) has been shown to improve the identification of other PTMs, we therefore expected it to facilitate the characterization of N-homocysteinylated proteins (N-Hcy-proteins) and help gain insight into their role in human disease. After extensive measurement optimization, we compared the yield of N-Hcy-protein/peptide identification across mouse liver and brain samples, either native or modified in vitro with HTL.

Tau is a prominent member of the IDP family which sees its cellular function regulated by multiple phosphorylations sites, and whose hyperphosphorylation is involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. We use coarse-grain MD simulations with the CALVADOS model to investigate the conformational landscape of tau without and with phosphorylations. Characterizing the local compacity of IDPs allows us to highlight how disorder comes in various flavors, as we can define different domains along the tau sequence. We define the IDP's Statistical Tertiary Organization (STO) as the average spatial arrangements of domains, which constitutes an extension of the tertiary structure of folded proteins. We also use IDP specific metrics to characterize the local curvature and flexibility of tau. Comparing the local flexibilities with T2 relaxation times from NMR experiments, we show how this metric is related to the protein dynamics. A curvature and flexibility pattern in the repeat domains can also be connected to tau binding properties, without having to explicitly model the protein's interaction partner. Finally, we rediscuss the original paperclip model that describes the spatial organization of tau, and how phosphorylations impact it.

In this work we introduce harmonic amplitude-modulated singular value decomposition (HAM-SVD), which synergizes pulse inversion (PI) with amplitude-modulated singular value decomposition (AM-SVD) to isolate GV-specific second-harmonic signals. In HAM-SVD, single-cycle plane waves at 9.6 MHz and five tilted angles (at a pulse repetition frequency of 2500 Hz) are transmitted under four duty cycles with alternating polarity. Beamformed IQ data are reshaped along a space x pressure matrix and decomposed via SVD; tissue background is cancelled by discarding the first and lowest singular modes, yielding an image comprised solely of pressure-dependent second harmonic signals. HAM-SVD sequence enables wide-field, ultrafast imaging without complex transmit sequences. Validation via simulations, in vitro phantoms, and in vivo rat lower limb experiments demonstrates HAM-SVD outperformance compared to PI and AM-SVD. HAM-SVD is shown to achieve a signal-to-background ratio (SBR) in vivo, surpassing PI and AM-SVD. HAM-SVD overcomes limitations of conventional nonlinear techniques (e.g., depth restrictions, tissue clutter) by combining PI harmonic sensitivity with AM-SVD adaptive clutter filtering of tissue signals.

Using coarse-grained molecular simulations, we systematically explored how distinct macromolecular crowding environments, including repulsive (steric) and attractive (interaction-based) crowding conditions, influence the phase behavior and internal organization of TDP-43 CTD condensates. Our findings reveal that both repulsive and attractive crowders maintain strong correlations between single-chain compaction, dimerization propensity, and macroscopic phase separation, yet operate via distinct physical mechanisms: repulsive crowders drive condensation through volume-exclusion-mediated entropic stabilization, while attractive crowders modulate condensate formation via competitive enthalpic interactions. Spatial structural analysis identifies a robust region-specific internal architecture, with -helices enriched at the condensate core and aligned parallel to the interface, and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) preferentially localized near the condensate surface in orientations nearly perpendicular to the interface. Dynamically, -helical regions form strong yet transient interaction hubs, whereas IDRs establish weaker but more persistent contacts, thereby maintaining structural fluidity.

We sequenced COI-barcodes from 9,120 Finnish phorid specimens and initially identified them using BOLD database. Furthermore, species identifications of all 843 non-Megaselia specimens were confirmed morphologically. Initially, the BOLD-based identifications matched the morphological identifications only in 68% of the cases, which resulted from many misidentifications in BOLD. After adjusting the BOLD reference identifications based on morphological analyses of male features, we established a reliable framework for female identification. This is advantageous for future identification of females, as they are often excluded from traditional identification keys. Only two species was discovered as new to Finland, demonstrating that Finnish non-Megaselia fauna is well-known. Although DNA barcodes show great promise for identifying phorids, incorrectly identified reference sequences remain challenging, not the functionality of COI itself. The number of Megaselia BINs greatly exceeded the known Finnish species count, with many sequences lacking matches in BOLD. This further highlights Megaselia as a particularly dark group, for which genetic tools are essential for uncovering species identities and assessing diversity.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Here, we tested whether an ensemble of state-of-the-art automatic staging algorithms can reliably classify sleep from a customized configuration of the ZMax headband, adapted to record a single fronto-mastoid EEG channel. A total of 35 nights of simultaneous ZMax and PSG recordings were acquired in a home setting, amounting to 250.02 hours of analysable data from 10 healthy participants. PSG data were scored according to AASM criteria by two independent experts from different sleep centres, with discrepancies resolved to obtain a consensus hypnogram. ZMax signal was processed using four machine-learning algorithms (YASA, U-Sleep, SleepTransformer, DeepResNet), whose predictions were further combined into a final ensemble scoring through soft-voting. The ensemble scoring achieved almost perfect agreement with human consensus staging (night-level mean {+/-} SD; accuracy = 88.83% {+/-} 2.84%, Cohen's {kappa} = 84.10% {+/-} 4.52%, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient = 84.54% {+/-} 4.23%). It showed excellent predictive accuracy for REM (F1-score = 93.99%), N3 (89.53%), N2 (87.93%), and wakefulness (86.37%), with lower performance for N1 (53.20%). These findings support the deployment of an ensemble scoring approach based on state-of-the-art sleep staging algorithms on ultra-minimal, mastoid-referenced EEG setups.

For example, even simple 2D shapes with varying contours have been shown to evoke vivid impressions of different materials (Pinna & Deiana, 2015). However, such static representations capture only a single moment in time. When a material moves, its contours shift, evolve, or deform over time, creating contour motion. Does this contour motion convey diagnostic information about material properties, independent of surface appearance? Existing studies on the role of dynamic cues in material perception either use fully rendered 3D stimuli, where contour motion is confounded with rich surface information, or motion-only displays (dynamic dot stimuli or noise patches), which eliminate surface cues but also lack clearly defined contours. As a result, the relative contribution of contour motion to material perception remains unclear. To address this gap, we measured how human observers perceive materials from dynamic line drawings (\"line\"), compared to animations of fully textured stimuli that carry optical and motion information (\"full\"), as well as dynamic dot stimuli (\"dot\"). Stimuli were rendered versions (full, dot, line) of material animations from five material categories (jelly, liquid, smoke, fabric, and rigid-breakable). In one experiment, participants rated five material attributes (dense, flexible, wobbly, fluid, airy motion), and in a second experiment, participants were asked to choose one of the two materials that is more similar to a third material across all possible combinations. Results from both experiments consistently reveal that 1) Dynamic line drawings vividly convey mechanical material properties, and 2) the similarity in material judgments between line and full conditions was larger than that between dot and full conditions. We conclude that contour motion carries rich information about mechanical material qualities.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

However, it is unclear which neural mechanisms reduce VPL for task-irrelevant signals. Here, we repeatedly exposed participants to a task-irrelevant visual signal (coherent motion in one direction) that was perceptually salient (suprathreshold for coherent motion detection) or weak (near threshold for coherent motion detection). The processing of the task-irrelevant signal in early visual areas during the first and final exposure sessions was measured using functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS). The behavioral results showed that discrimination sensitivity for the exposed coherent motion direction increased to a greater extent after near threshold than after suprathreshold exposure. The fMRS results showed that excitatory processing in early visual areas, as reflected in the concentration of glutamate, was lower during suprathreshold than near threshold exposure. The lower the level of excitatory processing in the first exposure session, the more deteriorated the discrimination sensitivity for the coherent motion direction after suprathreshold exposure. When the coherent motion direction was rendered task-relevant, levels of glutamate in early visual areas reversed such that excitatory processing was greater when the coherent motion direction was presented suprathreshold than near threshold. This suggests that the level of excitatory processing in early visual areas changes with the task relevance and perceptual salience of a visual signal, which may modulate the extent of VPL for this signal when it is repeatedly exposed.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Our findings reveal that expression of both Abeta and Tau lead to significant reductions in neuronal activity and function in young adult animals preceding the accumulation of amyloid aggregates. Notably, Abeta expression and aggregation in muscle tissue produced comparable detrimental effects on neuronal activity as its expression in neurons, suggesting that proteotoxic stress in muscle can influence neuronal function.

J.; Smeets, J. B. J.; van Wijk, B. C. M.", "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that decision making is not a purely cognitive process preceding motor output but rather an embodied phenomenon in which the sensorimotor system actively shapes choice selection. Beta oscillations (13-30 Hz) over left and right sensorimotor cortex have been shown to encode motor action and exert inhibitory influence through lateralization of the post-movement rebound, biasing subsequent decisions toward responses with the other hand. This study investigated whether sensorimotor beta oscillations elicited by an isolated choice-unrelated motor action could influence a subsequent perceptual decision. Twenty-nine healthy adults (25 right-handed) completed a two-stage task while 64-channel EEG was recorded. In each trial, participants executed an initial button press with either the left or right thumb to a letter cue (\"L\" or \"R\") followed by, after a variable delay (0.5, 1.2 or 3 s), a briefly presented visual grating requiring a decision response on the orientation of the grating via a second button press. We computed the degree of beta power lateralization between left and right (pre-) motor cortical sources that was present during presentation of the grating stimulus and quantified choice bias as the threshold difference between psychometric curves fitted to left- versus right-initial response trials. Participants with stronger beta lateralization during stimulus presentation showed a greater tendency to alternate their decision response from the hand used for the initial button press and exhibited slower decision speeds. However, we failed to detect a significant group-level decision bias induced by the initial motor action, nor were there consistent within-subject correlations between decision bias and beta lateralization across delays. Following the perspective of embodied-decision making, our results partially support the influence of motor cortex activity on the choice process, while also suggesting that beta activity may serve as a trait-like index of individual susceptibility to decision bias.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

One of the consequences of climate change is an increased risk of being infected by pathogens. Many of these pathogens are relying on vectors for transmission. As most vectors are ectotherms, with a tight relationship to ambient temperature for e.g. activity, temperature-dependent variation in vector density may be the mechanism explaining increasing parasitemia. In this study, we estimate the abundance of biting midges (Culicoides spp), a vector of Haemoproteus parasites, by placing sticky traps within nest boxes of breeding blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). We found that average minimum temperatures positively affect the abundance of midges. Thus, with recent and predicted higher temperatures, the encounter rate between hosts and vectors will increase with a resulting higher parasitemia. Marked differences in spring temperatures will also result in cohort effects, with whole generations of first-year birds being more or less infected by the parasites with yearly effects on recruitment rate and total host densities. Furthermore, we found pronounced temporal and spatial variation within years. This will put increasing emphasis on breeding parents to use cues indicating high vector abundances when determining breeding timing and choice of breeding habitat.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Using PAM, a mixed grassland and scrubland ecosystem was monitored for five months for avifaunal diversity. Data collected from dusk to dawn using audio recorders deployed on the study site were run through BirdNET analyzer under default detectors. Top detections for each species were compared with avian vocalization libraries manually. Out of 135 species detected, 76 were true positives, resulting in a species identification accuracy of 56.3%. Notably, among the species that were true detections, 21 species were found to have confidence scores larger than 0.99, where the range of confidence scores used was 0.75 to 1. In addition, 15 of the detected species were found to be migratory in this area, and three were found to be rare.

During the 2023/24 season, we conducted whole-genome sequencing of 1129 clinical samples using a hybrid-capture protocol. These samples were pre-tested by real-time PCR panels throughout Switzerland. Leveraging publicly-available full-length genomes, we constructed background datasets representative of geographical diversity and built phylogenies for all viruses with more than 40 new high-quality genomes from this study. We detected 981 viruses and recovered 461 high-quality genomes, including 18 co-infections, from 437 PCR-positive and 6 PCR-negative samples. All viruses detected by PCR were also detected by sequencing in 56% of samples. The four most prevalent viruses were Influenza A/H1N1, SARS-CoV-2, RSV-A, and HPIV-3, and their seasonal spread was consistent with wastewater monitoring and influenza-like illness reports. Swiss viral genomes were representative of the global genomic diversity, with evidence for multiple introductions into Switzerland, and we identified putative Swiss clusters.

Despite this variation, the effects of personality in shaping these relationships remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether subordinates adjust their flight initiation distance (FID) according to the dominant's aggressiveness. We collected video recordings of supplanting behaviours between non-kin dyads in Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata). For each dyad, we evaluated these supplantings whether the subordinate's FID was greater or less than two meters. To assess aggressiveness, we conducted 20-min focal observations of 20 females, recording of threats and aggressions (chasing or biting). We calculated repeatability of aggressiveness as a measure of dominant's personality. Rank differences were determined based on supplantings and aggressive interactions. As a result, aggressiveness showed high repeatability, independent of rank and sex. Subordinates were more likely to flee at greater distances (FID [&ge;] 2 m) when paired with more aggressive dominants. Rank difference did not significantly influence FID. Most dyads did not engage in grooming interactions during focal observations. Our findings suggest that Japanese macaques adjust inter-individual distance not based on rank differences but in response to aggressiveness.

AMPK and mTOR are two central metabolic regulators, with AMPK acting to slow down and mTOR to promote anabolism. Typically, low glucose inhibits TRPVs, leading to AMPK activation and mTOR complex I (mTORC1) inhibition. Here, we observed surprisingly that mTORC1 in the foetal liver remains active in low glucose, although AMPK is effectively activated in an AMP-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we found that TRPV4, a key liver TRPV, is acetylated at K608, disabling its inactivation by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP)-unoccupied aldolase. Mutation of K608 to arginine renders TRPV4 able to respond to low glucose in foetal hepatocytes. Consistently, embryonic liver-specific expression of acetylation-defective TRPV4-K608R mutant led to mTORC1 inhibition, and caused abnormal intrauterine development or even foetal death.

To improve our knowledge on Solanaceae responses to the bacterial wilt pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen between tomato RLCKs and effectors conserved in R. solanacearum Korean isolates. Several members of RLCK subfamily IXb, which contain a ubiquitin-ligase plant U-box domain in addition to the kinase domain, interacted with RipV1, an effector containing a novel E3 ligase domain (NEL). In vitro assays revealed that RLCK-IXb-1 displayed ubiquitin-ligase activity but no detectable kinase activity. RipV1 could trans-ubiquitinate RLCK-IXb-1 in vitro and promote its stability in planta. Using virus-induced gene silencing of RLCK-IXb homologs in Nicotiana benthamiana, we could further show that several RLCK-IXb proteins act as negative regulators of early PTI signaling. RipV1 was previously reported to contribute to R. solanacearum virulence in potato and to elicit cell death in an E3 ligase activity-dependent manner in N. benthamiana. Here we show that RipV1-induced cell death occurred in plants impaired for effector recognition but could be suppressed by over-expression of RLCK-IXb-1, suggesting that this response is related to the virulence function of RipV1.

The high-throughput nature of this method in tandem with its sensitivity, as low as 10 pM, allows for quick and seamless identification of hit compounds. Here we discuss ways to overcome common pitfalls that can occur while using BLI such as nonspecific binding (NSB) and ligand drift while offering possible solutions. Characterizing small molecule-protein interactions is not trivial and optimizing the experimental conditions is imperative. To address this gap in knowledge, we present optimized BLI protocols for the study of three cases of protein-small molecule interactions: PF74 or Lenacapavir (LEN) with HIV-1 capsid protein (CA), and Nirmaltrevir (NIR) with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. LEN and NIR are of particular interest because they are clinically relevant, and PF74, a well-studied control, was the first compound reported to target the LEN binding site. We demonstrate that BLI can be a powerful and effective tool in calculating the binding affinities between a protein and small molecule. These newly designed methods enabled calculation of KD values, the affinity between ligand and analyte, ranging from the micro to the sub-nanomolar range for CA binding events and confirmed the covalent interaction between NIR and Mpro.

EPR measurements reveal that the native ECM is the primary contributor to radical reduction, whereas other biofilm components, such as planktonic cells, isolated ECM, and dried biofilms show minimal activity. Radical reduction rates vary with biofilm morphology and composition. ssNMR identifies both rigid and flexible polysaccharides and lipids within the ECM as primary radical interaction sites. These findings support a mechanism in which the ECM not only serves as a physical barrier but also has reductive activity that protects against xenobiotics. Importantly, we demonstrate that potassium ferricyanide and hydrogen peroxide preserves EPR signal intensity and radical lifetime in native biofilms, offering a promising biocompatible mitigation strategy. Our findings quantify and pinpoint the origins of the reductive nature of bacterial biofilms and provide a solid framework for improving radical stability in native biological systems for high efficiency structural studies.

We demonstrate that this system mediates inter-genus antagonism against Listeria monocytogenes via a bactericidal, heat-labile protein, and that toxicity depends on extracellular cleavage of the BetaH domain by an S8 peptidase. This processed peptide resembles a cationic antimicrobial peptide (CAMP) and facilitates intoxication of target cells by the Ntox35 RNase domain. Target cell resistance is impacted by known CAMP defense pathways, including DltABCD and MprF, and experimental evolution identified the ABC transporter AnrAB as essential for intoxication. Unexpectedly, disruption of AnrAB abolished Ntox35 susceptibility, while simultaneously sensitizing cells to the proposed CAMP like activity of the processed BetaH domain. These findings reveal a novel mechanism of inter-genus antagonism among Firmicutes and establish a functional role for extracellular processing and ABC transporter-mediated susceptibility in PTS activity. Our work expands the known repertoire of diffusible toxins in Gram-positive bacteria and sets the foundation for broader ecological and mechanistic investigation of S8-PTS systems.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of four SFG Rickettsia species - R. africae, R. parkeri, R. massiliae, and R. montanensis - using high-throughput label-free SWATH/DIA-MS/MS in human HUVEC/TERT2 cells. Our results revealed distinct intracellular growth dynamics that correlated with known virulence profiles: the more pathogenic R. africae and R. parkeri replicated more efficiently, while the non-pathogenic R. montanensis failed to replicate. Proteomic profiling uncovered both shared and species-specific host responses, with a marked induction of proteins associated with type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling, particularly in response to R. africae and R. parkeri. Proteins typically involved in antiviral immunity, such as RIG-I, ISG15, IFITs, MX1, MX2, and OAS family members, were significantly accumulated, suggesting activation of cytosolic nucleic acid sensing pathways upon infection with pathogenic rickettsiae. ISGylation levels, however, remained low and varied depending on the species, pointing to complex regulatory mechanisms. Comparison with previous quantitative proteomics data in THP-1 macrophages revealed a conserved interferon signature, while also highlighting cell-type-specific responses. Overall, our findings demonstrate that endothelial cells activate innate immune pathways typically associated with antiviral defense upon Rickettsia infection. These immune signatures may serve as potential indicators of pathogenic potential and provide a foundation for identifying biomarkers and therapeutic targets in rickettsial diseases.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

We investigated host proteins associated with detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) of the DENV replication complex and identified Human antigen R (HuR) as a key RBP enriched in the DRM. HuR was found to negatively regulate DENV replication by binding the DENV-3'UTR and impeding the association of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), a known RNA stabilizer. Additionally, infection-induced modulation of HuR stabilized host mRNAs involved in innate immunity. Interestingly, in vivo validation in AG129 mice model highlights an inverse correlation between HuR expression and viral load and implicates HuR in cytokine dysregulation.

In this work, we examined the capabilities of a commercially available high-throughput single-cell dispensing solution to selectively target and isolate diverse strains of a genus of interest, Bifidobacterium, from fecal samples. The general performance of the single-cell dispenser was first assessed, revealing a low doublet frequency of 11.5% and an ability to preserve global genus diversity when a mixed culture of Bifidobacterium was dispensed. Culturing-related factors including the use of an effective selection medium, such as the Bifidus Selective Medium supplemented with mupirocin (BSM-MUP), and the length of incubation were found to be critical in determining isolation success. Leveraging these results, we obtained a total of 622 viable isolates from five Singaporean fecal samples, among which ~98.7% were bifidobacteria.

The new isolate, named BR-AMG2, is a chlorovirus infecting the microalga Chlorella variabilis. Members of the family Phycodnaviridae, the chloroviruses have large linear dsDNA genomes (285-410 kbp), encoding hundreds of proteins and tRNAs. Despite their ecological and evolutionary importance, chloroviruses remain poorly studied, especially in South America. This study aimed to expand the understanding of this viral group by isolating and fully characterizing new chloroviruses in Brazil. After inoculating alga cultures with environmental samples, cytopathic effects, marked by lysis plaque formation, were observed 72 hours post-sampling. Chlorovirus BR-AMG2 remained stable across a temperature range of -30 {degrees}C to 37 {degrees}C, yet was highly sensitive to UV exposure. This virus has a 160 nm icosahedral capsid and establishes a large viral factory in the host cytoplasm. Whole genome sequencing revealed a 338,043 bp genome, containing 11 tRNAs and 388 protein-coding sequences. We observed an extensive DNA methylation machinery, accounting for ~5% of gene content in this isolate, suggesting a highly methylated genome. Phylogenetic reconstruction and Average Nucleotide Identity analyses confirmed that BR-AMG2 is a new member of the species Chlorovirus americanus, the first isolate recovered from a tropical region of the planet.

Notably, the role of the gut microbiota and polymicrobial interactions in shaping population heterogeneity of invading pathogens has not been explored. Here, we show that Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen that thrives in the inflamed gut during C. difficile infection, can impact the phase variable CmrRST signal transduction system in C. difficile. The CmrRST system controls multiple phenotypes including colony morphology, cell elongation, and cell chaining in C. difficile. Here we describe how interactions between E. faecalis and C. difficile on solid media lead to a marked shift in C. difficile phenotypes associated with phase variation of CmrRST. Specifically, E. faecalis drives a switch of the C. difficile population to the cmr-ON state leading to chaining and a rough colony morphology. This phenomenon preferentially occurs with E. faecalis among the enterococci, as other enterococcal species do not show a similar effect, suggesting that the composition of the polymicrobial environment in the gut is likely critical to shaping C. difficile population heterogeneity.

We aimed to investigate the presence and diversity of denitrifying bacteria of the candidate family Azoamicaceae that form obligate symbioses with protists in wastewater treatment plants. Our analyses showed that denitrifying endosymbionts belonging to the Ca. Azoamicus genus are present in 20-50% of wastewater treatment plants worldwide. Time-resolved amplicon data from four Danish wastewater treatment plants showed high temporal fluctuations in the abundance and composition of the denitrifying endosymbiont community. Fifteen high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes of denitrifying endosymbionts, four of which were circular, were recovered.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), as post-transcriptional regulators, play key roles in immune regulation and host-virus interactions. We hypothesized that physiological adaptations to pregnancy include the modulation of systemic miRNA expression, which in turn regulates host genes involved in HIV interaction, potentially influencing susceptibility during pregnancy. To test this, we leveraged a large longitudinal cohort from Uganda and Zimbabwe and analyzed 174 serum samples from 88 participants in pre-pregnancy (PP), pregnancy (P), and breastfeeding (BF) states using the HTG EdgeSeq platform. Differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in pregnancy were identified with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.1 (29 upregulated and 131 downregulated) by intersecting pairwise comparisons (P vs. PP and P vs. BF). Validated gene targets (2,733) were identified via miRWalk and modular enrichment analysis performed using Cytoscape/ClueGO. Enriched pathways (FDR<0.05) included Adaptive Immune Response, Hippo Signaling, Cellular Senescence, HSV-1 Infection, and two cancer-related pathways. Genes from pregnancy-enriched pathways overlapped with the known HIV-host interactome at the range of 37 to 88%. From this overlap, the Maximal Clique Centrally (MCC) score (cytoHubba) identified 47 unique hub genes acting as essential regulatory nodes of protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. These hub genes were further examined by their expression patterns predicted by DE miRNAs, and explored for their interactions with the HIV interactome, revealing connectivity with 18 HIV proteins (highest with Tat and gp120) and impact on the HIV replication process. HLA-A was the most connected host gene, followed by BCL2L1, EIF2AK2, PTEN, and CYCS.

Increases in gene copy number can confer a strong selective advantage in some circumstances, but CNVs can also incur fitness costs. Prior research has shown that experimental evolution of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in nutrient-limited chemostats recurrently selects for amplifications of nutrient transporter genes, including GAP1, MEP2, and PUT4 in glutamine, ammonium and proline limited conditions, respectively. However, the fate of these CNVs upon return of the organism to a non-selective environment, is unknown. To investigate the fitness costs and stability of CNVs upon reversal of the original selection pressure, we studied 15 unique CNV lineages that had been selected in different nitrogen-limited chemostats, including both segmental amplifications and whole-chromosome aneuploidies. We studied the stability of CNVs using a fluorescent CNV reporter system during propagation in nutrient-rich media using serial dilution of batch cultures for 110-220 generations. We found that only one-third of CNV lineages repeatedly underwent loss of CNVs and reversion to a single-copy genotype. All lineages containing aneuploidies showed rapid reversion dynamics, whereas lineages containing segmental amplifications were remarkably stable - only one of 11 strains reverted to a single copy. Pairwise competitive fitness assays revealed strong fitness defects associated with reverting CNVs in the nutrient-rich environment but minimal fitness defects in lineages that did not revert. Reversion of CNVs led to increased fitness. Using simulation-based inference to estimate reversion rates and fitness effects we find that negative selection is the primary driver of CNV loss although aneuploid reversion rates are high with estimates of 10-5 to 10-3. Whole-genome sequencing of clones isolated from evolved populations revealed that reversion of both aneuploids and a segmental amplification left no evidence of prior existence of the CNV, making the genomes of revertants indistinguishable from the single-copy ancestor. Our findings provide novel evidence of the low fitness cost and high stability of most segmental CNVs upon removal of the selection pressure, and that gene amplifications with large fitness costs are readily reversible, highlighting the significance of CNVs for genome evolution as well as rapid and reversible adaptation to transient selection pressures.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

We found that evolutionary transitions leading to reduced numbers of eyes are primarily associated with parallel genome-wide relaxed selection. While these independent reduction events shared several genes under consistent selective pressures, they did not share any genes under positive selection, indicating putatively divergent molecular mechanisms.

However, transgenic proteins can themselves impact cellular and physiological processes in ways that are often ignored or poorly defined. Here we discovered that the yolk-GAL4 transgene, which directs strong expression of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor in the Drosophila fat body, induces significant physiological defects in adult female flies. We found that yolk-GAL4 disrupts adipose tissue integrity and reduces fat body lipid stores, egg production, and resistance to systemic bacterial infections. Knocking down GAL4 expression in yolk-GAL4 heterozygotes using RNAi fully suppressed each of these defects, thus confirming that the GAL4 transgene product induces these phenotypes. Comparing a panel of additional fat body driver lines, we found that GAL4 expression levels directly correlate infection susceptibility, but not with fat levels or egg production. To determine whether other transgenic proteins can impair fat body function, we constructed new fly lines in which the yolk enhancer directs expression of either cytoplasmic or nuclear-localized mCherry, or an alternative transactivator, LexA. We found that only nuclear-localized mCherry and LexA increased infection susceptibility similarly to GAL4, suggesting that intranuclear transgenic proteins in general can curtail the fat bodys induced immune response in a manner highly sensitive to transgene expression strength. Additionally, these new lines can be valuable tools for future studies.

This shows that semantically rich and category-structured representations are required for modelling context sensitivity. Notably, context sensitive behavior was closest to humans in VLMs when using language-guided inference at test time. This suggests that how a model accesses its representations during inference is relevant for enabling context-sensitive behavior. Together, this work offers steps towards a computational account of contextual facilitation of objects by scenes, and highlights zero-shot inference as an interesting alignment metric when benchmarking artificial and biological vision.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Coupling whole virus genome sequencing with the monitoring of influenza cases allows for the identification of increased disease burden and the emergence of novel virus variants. METHODS Influenza B virus infected individuals were identified in the Johns Hopkins Health Systems network and whole IBV genome sequencing was performed. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments were used to identify the IBV clades and novel virus mutations. The amount of neutralizing antibody activity specific to different IBV clades was measured. RESULTS Late in the 2024-25 Northern Hemisphere influenza season, a surge of IBV cases were identified. The IBV responsible for the surge, C.3re, was a clade C.3 virus that had reassorted with clade C.5.1 viruses and acquired a mutation predicted to mask a key neutralizing antibody epitope on the hemagglutinin protein. The neuramindase gene contained mutations predicted to reduce neutralizing antibody binding and potentially alter oseltamivir sensitivity. The C.3re viruses preferentially infected children but showed no significant increase in disease severity. The C.3re viruses were poorly neutralized by pre and post influenza vaccination serum. CONCLUSIONS The C.3re IBV genotype that emerged in late in the 2024-25 influenza season is antigenically mismatched with current circulating IBVs and the IBV vaccine strains chosen for the 2025 Southern Hemisphere and 2024-25 Northern Hemisphere season. This may result in lower vaccine efficacy increases in IBV cases in upcoming influenza seasons.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

N.; Wang, Z.; Yang, Z.", "abstract": "Poxviruses remain a significant global health concern, necessitating the development of novel antiviral strategies. Through high-throughput screening, we previously identified ciclopirox (CPX), an FDA-approved antifungal, as a hit that inhibits vaccinia virus (VACV) replication. Here, we further characterized its antiviral activity and mechanism of action using human primary fibroblasts. CPX significantly reduced VACV titers without reducing host cell viability, with an EC50 in the sub-micromolar range and a CC50 >500M. Rescue experiments demonstrated that CPX inhibits viral replication primarily through chelation of intracellular Fe3+ and, to a lesser extent, Fe2+, as evidenced by partial restoration of viral replication with ferric ammonium citrate supplementation. Furthermore, overexpression of the iron-dependent enzymes RRM2 and the VACV-encoded F4L reduced the inhibitory effect of CPX, indicating that these host and viral proteins are affected by CPX treatment. Moreover, CPX treatment also suppressed cowpox virus and monkeypox (mpox) virus replication in vitro. It also reduced VACV titers in ex vivo mouse lung tissue. These findings highlight host iron metabolism as a critical determinant of poxvirus replication and support repurposing CPX as a broad-spectrum orthopoxvirus antiviral candidate.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

Herein, we sequenced MVEV isolates from the Ralph Doherty Virus Collection, a virus bank with Australian field isolates dating between the 1950s-1980s, and determined their phylogenetic relationship with existing isolates to provide insights into virus evolution and genetic diversity. Additionally, we characterised isolates from different genotypes both in vitro using human neuronal cells, and in vivo using C57BL/6J mice, to provide additional insight into MVEV pathogenicity and establish models of MVEV disease that recapitulate MVEV human disease. We found 15 new full length sequences of MVEV, which primarily clustered into the dominant genotype, G1. Additionally, we show MVEV can be lethal and neuroinvasive in C57BL/6J mice, recapitulating histological lesions identified in human infection.

However, the mechanism by which CMG2 transmits signals to orient endothelial cells is unknown. Here, we use affinity proteomics to identify proteins that interact with CMG2. This led us to investigate CMG2 interaction with F-actin in the context of serum and individual growth factors (bFGF/PDGF/VEGF) in both primary and immortalized endothelial cells. We also measured different matrix-protein-mediated changes in chemotaxis. We find that CMG2 function is matrix dependent, and that CMG2-actin interaction is required for serum- and growth-factor-induced chemotaxis. Inhibiting chemotaxis with CMG2 antagonists (collagen 6, penta-galloyl-glucose, or anthrax toxin protective antigen; PA) leads to the release of actin cytoskeleton from CMG2. Furthermore, CMG2 co-localizes with actin at the leading edge during live migration. This colocalization is disrupted by PA, which also disrupts directional movement. Finally, we demonstrate that the conserved actin binding domain of CMG2 directly binds to F-actin in vitro where it bundles F-actin, suggesting a mechanism by which it enables directional migration.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

To assess spatiotemporal changes in pathogen dynamics in vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in response to habitat fragmentation, we used general linear mixed models to investigate the influence of site, year, and tree cover on the prevalence of Bartonella and hemotropic Mycoplasma (hemoplasma) in bats in one large and one small forest fragment in northern Belize across seven years. Bartonella was marginally more prevalent in later years, while year and site differences in hemoplasma infections were driven by a peak in prevalence in the third year of the study in the small fragment. Bartonella prevalence increased with forest loss, but only in the large fragment, whereas hemoplasma prevalence showed a marginal negative response to forest loss. The effects of site, year, and forest loss on infection likelihood varied by pathogen genotype. Neither site nor year affected Bartonella genotypes, but one genotype was positively associated with tree cover. Two hemoplasma genotypes were influenced by year, but with differing trends. One genotype increased with tree cover regardless of site while another increased with forest loss at the small fragment only. Our work demonstrates that the effects of habitat fragmentation on infection prevalence depended on both the pathogen and specific genotype. Our findings complicate expectations of how habitat fragmentation affects infectious disease dynamics in bats. As such, management practices aimed at mitigating the impacts of infectious diseases in fragmented systems should be tailored to specific pathogens of concern.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

This complex resolves DNA lesions during transcription to maintain genome integrity, while in HD, mHTT impairs the activity of this complex, resulting in accumulation of DNA lesions. Using molecular, cellular biology and computational methods, we find that HTT has a role in assembling a functional DNA repair complex in mitochondria. Together with mitochondrial RNA polymerase and transcription factors, HTT resolves mitochondrial DNA lesions to preserve mitochondrial genome integrity and function. Pathogenic mHTT impairs this activity, resulting in persistent DNA lesions and reduced mitochondrial function in HD.

Predictive coding proposes that the brain emphasises unexpected information via prediction errors, whereas Bayesian models emphasise expected information through sharpening. We reconcile these views through direct neural evidence from electroencephalography showing that both mechanisms operate at different hierarchical levels during speech perception. Across multiple experiments, participants heard identical ambiguous speech in different speaker contexts. Using speech decoding, we show that listeners learn speaker-specific semantic priors, which sharpen sensory representations by pulling them toward expected acoustic signals. In contrast, encoding models leveraging large language models reveal that prediction errors emerge at higher linguistic levels. These findings support a unified model of predictive processing, wherein sharpening and prediction errors coexist at distinct hierarchical levels to facilitate both robust perception and adaptive world models.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

The composition of these white matter connections (SC) shapes inter-regional signaling dynamics giving rise to spatial patterns of synchronous functional connectivity (FC). Several modeling approaches have proven useful for studying the mechanisms underlying the relationship between SC and FC. However, the myelination of white matter tracts -- a major component of white matter connectivity -- is not accounted for by conventional SC networks, and thus, has largely been excluded from models of FC. Here, we expand structure-function brain modeling by integrating a multi-feature white matter SC network. We use multi-modal MRI to compute an SC network with connections (edges) weighted by the caliber, myelination, and length of white matter tracts. We investigate the relationship of this multi-feature SC network with both haemodynamic and electromagnetic FC. Edge myelin was strongly predictive of FC in a pattern that was heterogeneous across brain regions and timescales of neural function. Edge myelin showed strong, frequency-specific interactions with both edge caliber and length suggesting a modulatory role for white matter myelin in structure-function coupling. This was further supported by antagonistic gradients of white matter myelin and structure-function coupling along the sensory-association axis. We describe in detail the individual and joint relationships between these major white matter features and multi-frequency FC. These results illustrate the advantage of a more comprehensive characterization of white matter in structure-function models and establish how white matter myelin -- known for roles in conduction velocity, plasticity, and metabolic support at the microscale -- shapes brain function at the macroscale.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

A central function in mental programming is working memory (WM), involving both temporarily maintaining the information and manipulating it based on rules. While the neural mechanisms of WM maintenance have been extensively studied, those governing WM manipulation remain largely unknown. To bridge this gap, the present study focuses on an elementary operation in WM manipulation: re-ordering items in WM sequences. We propose a functional, biologically plausible neural circuit model that consists of two interconnected modules: a memory module composed of continuous attractor-based memory slots that store item features, and a control module sending gain-modulating commands to orchestrate specific operations in the memory module. The model successfully implements two-item swapping in a WM sequence, generating neuronal responses similar to recent primate experiments of WM sequence manipulation. By incorporating principles from the algebraic permutation group, we generalize the circuit model to accommodate more complex sequence manipulations. This math foundation reveals how arbitrary permutations can be decomposed into sequences of elementary swapping operations, which can be generated by a hierarchical tree-structured control circuit module. And the mutual inhibition within the control tree ensures that only one program is being executed at the same time. Our study establishes overarching connections among mental programming neural circuit models, neuroscience experiments, and abstract algebraic structure. These insights enhance our understanding of the neural underpinnings of cognitive reasoning and inspire the design of artificial cognitive systems.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

We found no statistically significant temporal trends in -diversity for any group. Total {beta}-diversity also appeared temporally stable.

However, how Yme1 selects substrates within the crowded mitochondrial environment is poorly understood. An established substrate of Yme1 in yeast is the Tim10 subunit of the small Tim9-Tim10 protein chaperone complex, which is degraded following disruption of the subunit's internal disulfide bonds. Here, we use biochemical and biophysical approaches to examine initial substrate binding and degradation of small Tim proteins by Yme1 and shed light on the molecular mechanism of substrate selection. We show that Yme1 preferentially binds Tim10 over other small Tim proteins by forming a high-affinity interaction with the subunit irrespective of the presence of its disulfide bonds. This interaction is primarily mediated by Tim10's flexible N-terminal tentacle, though substrate unfolding exposes additional contact sites that enhance engagement. Notably, the human ortholog TIMM13 is also recognized by yeast Yme1, suggesting conservation of recognition strategy across species. Yme1 also binds to the assembled Tim9-Tim10 chaperone but independently of the Tim10 N-terminal tentacle.

In contrast, behavioral inflexibility provides efficiency and automaticity in familiar contexts, and is promoted by the dorsolateral striatum (DLS). Importantly, chronic elevation of the primary stress hormone, corticosterone (CORT) in rodents or cortisol in humans, impairs behavioral flexibility through dendritic atrophy in the DMS, and promotes inflexible behavioral response strategies through dendritic outgrowth in the DLS. However, understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the structural changes promoting behavioral inflexibility is lacking. We used a food-motivated operant task in male and female mice to define synaptic plasticity gene regulation supporting a decreased DMS activity and increased DLS activity in the shift to inflexible behavior with CORT. We discovered that CORT-accelerated loss of behavioral flexibility is accompanied by decreased DMS- and increased DLS-specific synaptic plasticity gene expression, and that distinct genes are either differentially expressed or spliced in the transition to inflexible behavior. Splicing analysis suggests that repressed activity in the DMS during the transition to inflexible behavior reflects both reduced expression and increased degradation of plasticity-related mRNA transcripts. Finally, given the ability of CORT to influence histone acetylation, we defined CORT-mediated H3K9ac enrichment profiles associated with synaptic plasticity gene regulation stratified by sex and striatal subregion.

The two pathogenic pmrB mutants showed clear evidence of LOS modification, which was linked to increased transcription of LOS modification enzymes, including the product of the cryptic eptA gene. Spontaneous insertion mutations that caused hyperexpression of eptA allowed the heteroresistant mutant to develop clinically-significant colistin resistance. Insertion mutations upstream of the eptA gene or those disrupting hns, which encodes a small histone-like protein, resulted in increased eptA transcript, linking expression of this protein to clinically significant resistance. The resistant variant selected from the heteroresistant parent was stable in the absence of drug, but continued passaging selected for colistin-resensitized pseudorevertants that were largely due to disruption of the LOS modification enzymes. Therefore, colistin heteroresistance is an early stage in the stepwise acquisition of stable resistance in A. baumannii.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}

However, a comprehensive analysis of gene expression, alternative splicing (AS), and RNA editing across various organs and developmental stages in cattle has not been reported. This study aims to create a comprehensive transcriptomic BodyMap across various tissues and developmental stages, integrating this information into genomic predictions of beef production traits. We created a comprehensive transcriptomic BodyMap using 400 samples collected from 52 organs of newborn, young, and adult cattle, and estimated their contributions to genetic variance and genomic predictions for 23 beef production traits in 1476 beef cattle. We cataloged the expression of 25,530 annotated genes, 28,533 novel long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), 215,754 AS events, and 3,093,058 A-to-I RNA-editing sites. Integrating transcriptome BodyMap with 23 beef production traits, we found lncRNAs influenced traits like rib-eye area and carcass length, while RNA editing associated with chunk roll weight and daily gain. We observed trait-relevant tissues between different stages, including the differential expressed genes of cerebellum, longissimus muscle, and testis between newborn and adult stages are more relevant to beef production traits. The tissue-specific genes and development-associated genes in several tissues could improve the reliability of genomic prediction in beef production traits. We developed Cattle BodyMap Transcriptome Database (https://cattlegenomics.online/cattle_bodymap) to retrieve, analyze, and visualize gene expression, lncRNA, splicing and RNA editing data. Our results demonstrated the potential of using transcriptome data as a valuable resource for genomic selection and breeding programs in beef cattle. Additionally, our transcriptome BodyMap serves as a valuable resource for biological interpretation, functional validation, and genomic improvement in livestock.", "date": "2025-07-24", "journal": ""}
