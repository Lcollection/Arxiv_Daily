Vascular tissues have different developmental origins that may influence global chromatin accessibility, and understanding differential chromatin accessibility, gene expression profiles, and gene regulatory networks (GRN) on single cell resolution may give key insight into vascular site-specific disease risk. Here, we performed single cell chromatin accessibility (scATACseq) and gene expression profiling (scRNAseq) of healthy adult mouse vascular tissue from three vascular sites, 1) aortic root and ascending aorta, 2) brachiocephalic and carotid artery, and 3) descending thoracic aorta. Through a comprehensive analysis at single cell resolution, we discovered key regulatory enhancers to not only be cell type, but vascular site specific in vascular smooth muscle (SMC), fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. We identified epigenetic markers of embryonic origin with differential chromatin accessibility of key developmental transcription factors such as Tbx20, Hand2, Gata4, and Hoxb family members and discovered transcription factor motif accessibility to be cell type and vascular site specific. Notably, we found ascending fibroblasts to have distinct epigenomic patterns, highlighting SMAD2/3 function to suggest a differential susceptibility to TGF{beta}, a finding we confirmed through in vitro culture of primary adventitial fibroblasts. Finally, to understand how vascular site-specific enhancers may regulate human genetic risk for disease, we integrated genome wide association study (GWAS) data for ascending and descending aortic dimension, and through using a distinct base resolution deep learning model to predict variant effect on chromatin accessibility, ChromBPNet, to predict variant effects in SMC, Fibroblasts, and Endothelial cells within ascending aorta, carotid, and descending aorta sites of origin. We reveal that although cell type remains a primary influence on variant effects, vascular site modifies cell type transcription and highlights genomic regions that are enriched for specific TF motif footprints, including MEF2A, SMAD3, and HAND2. This work supports a paradigm that the epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape of vascular cells are cell type and vascular site-specific and that site-specific enhancers govern complex genetic drivers of disease risk.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

While the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) has been proposed as a candidate region supporting this decision, it remains unclear whether dACC activity tracks rewards and costs independently or integrates them to reflect effort intensity. Recent accounts posit that the dACC plays a key role in mediating cost-benefit trade-offs. However, empirical evidence remains scarce. A systematic meta-analysis review of neuroimaging studies was conducted, using the activation-likelihood estimation method to quantify brain activity across 45 studies (N = 1273 participants) investigating reward-guided effort. Results found reliable recruitment of the dACC, putamen, and anterior insula for processing larger rewards and increasing task demands. However, the dACC clusters sensitive to task demands and rewards were anatomically distinct with no significant overlap: caudal dACC activity tracked increasing task demands, while rostral dACC activity tracked increasing reward. We also observed that caudal dACC activity tracked the integration of costs and benefits. These findings suggest there are distinct signals for demand and effort in the dACC, which are integrated to support the decision to invest effort.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Here we examined the function of neuroligins in astrocytes with a rigorous genetic approach that uses the conditional deletion of all major neuroligins (Nlgn1-3) in astrocytes in vivo and complemented this approach by a genetic deletion of neuroligins in glia cells that are co-cultured with human neurons. Our results show that early postnatal deletion of neuroligins from astrocytes in vivo has no detectable effect on cortical or hippocampal synapses and does not alter the cytoarchitecture of astrocytes when evaluated in young adult mice. Moreover, deletion of astrocytic neuroligins in co-cultures of human neurons produced no detectable consequences for the formation and function of synapses.

We observed that D2Rs were expressed in DANs and the mushroom body (MB) in third instar larval brains. Knockdown of D2Rs in DAN-c1 by microRNA impaired aversive learning. Optogenetic activation of DAN-c1 during training led to an aversive learning deficit as well, indicating that D2R achieves its functions via autoreceptor inhibition. Interestingly, knockdown of D2R in MB impaired both appetitive and aversive learning.

Internal prioritization is known to guide the selection of external sensory input, but the reverse may also be possible: Does the environment guide the prioritization of memorized material? Here we addressed whether reappearing sensory input can facilitate the prioritization of other non-reappearing memorized items held in visual working memory (VWM). Participants (total n = 96) memorized three orientations. Crucially some, but not all, items maintained in VWM were made available again in the environment. These reappearing items never had to be reproduced later. Experiment 1 showed that the reappearance of all but one memory item benefited accuracy and speed to the same extent as a spatial retro cue. This shows that reappearing items allow for the dynamic prioritization of another non-reappearing memorized item. What aspects of the reappearing sensory input drive this effect? Experiments 2-4 demonstrated that prioritization was facilitated most if reappearing items matched VWM content in terms of both location and orientation. Sensory input fully matching VWM is possibly processed more efficiently and/or protects against interference, ultimately leading to stronger prioritization of other memory content. We propose that the link between sensory processing and VWM is bidirectional: internal representations guide the processing of sensory input, which in turn facilitates the prioritization of other VWM content to subserve adaptive behavior.

Increased levels of phosphorylated Tau in the cytosol pose the risk of pathological aggregation, as observed in neurodegenerative diseases. We show that binding of 14-3-3{zeta} enhances cytosolic Tau solubility by promoting phosphorylated Tau removal from MTs, while simultaneously inhibiting Tau aggregation both directly and indirectly via suppression of condensate formation. These 14-3-3{zeta} activities depend on site-specific binding of 14-3-3 to Tau phosphorylated at S214 and S324. At sub-stoichiometric 14-3-3{zeta} concentrations, or in the presence of other 14-3-3{zeta} binding partners, multivalent electrostatic interactions promote Tau:14-3-3{zeta} co-condensation, offering a phosphorylation-independent mode of Tau-14-3-3{zeta} interactions. Given the high abundance of 14-3-3 proteins in the brain, 14-3-3 binding could provide efficient multi-modal chaperoning activity for Tau in the healthy brain and be important for preventing Tau aggregation in disease.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

L.; Lopez, V.; Shields, D. C.", "abstract": "Quantifying model generalization to out-of-distribution data has been a longstanding challenge in machine learning. Addressing this issue is crucial for leveraging machine learning in scientific discovery, where models must generalize to new molecules or materials. Current methods typically split data into train and test sets using various criteria, like temporal, sequence identity, scaffold, or random cross-validation; before evaluating model performance. However, with so many splitting criteria available, existing approaches offer limited guidance on selecting the most appropriate one, and they do not provide mechanisms for incorporating prior knowledge about the target deployment distribution(s). To tackle this problem, we have developed a novel metric, AU-GOOD, which quantifies expected model performance under conditions of increasing dissimilarity between train and test sets, while also accounting for prior knowledge about the target deployment distribution(s), when available. This metric is broadly applicable to biochemical entities, including proteins, small molecules, nucleic acids, or cells; as long as a relevant similarity function is defined for them. Recognizing the wide range of similarity functions used in biochemistry, we propose criteria to guide the selection of the most appropriate metric for partitioning. We also introduce a new partitioning algorithm that generates more challenging test sets, and we propose statistical methods for comparing models based on AU-GOOD. Finally, we demonstrate the insights that can be gained from this framework by applying it to two different use cases: developing predictors for pharmaceutical properties of small molecules, and using protein language models as embeddings to build biophysical property predictors.

Although this theory is fundamental to our understanding of disease dynamics [2,5-8], it remains unconfirmed how local density generally drives individuals' positions within their networks, which reduces our ability to understand and predict density-dependent processes [4,9,10]. Here we provide the first general evidence that density drives greater network connectedness at fine spatiotemporal scales, at the scale of individuals within wild animal populations. We analysed 36 datasets of simultaneous spatial and social behaviour in >58,000 individual animals, spanning 30 species of fish, reptiles, birds, mammals, and insects. 80% of systems exhibited strong positive relationships between local density and network centrality. However, >80% of relationships were nonlinear and 75% became shallower at higher values, signifying that demographic and behavioural processes counteract density's effects, thereby producing saturating trends [11-15]. Density's effect was much stronger and less saturating for spatial than social networks, such that individuals become disproportionately spatially connected rather than socially at higher densities. Consequently, ecological processes that depend on spatial connections (e.g. indirect pathogen transmission, resource competition, and territory formation) are likely more density-dependent than those involving social interactions (e.g. direct pathogen transmission, aggression, and social learning). These findings reveal fundamental ecological rules governing societal structuring, with widespread implications. Identifying scaling rules based on processes that generalise across systems, such as these patterns of density dependence, might provide the ability to predict network structures in novel systems.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we investigated the biochemical and in vitro functional properties of recombinant fragments from IgMs corresponding to the Fc-core in their pentameric or hexameric forms. Biophysical experiments confirmed the crucial role of the IgM Joining chain (J) in favoring homogenous pentamers, while its absence led to heterogeneous population with a mixture of oligomeric forms. By combining size-exclusion chromatography with mass photometry, isolation of enriched samples with IgM hexamers or IgM pentamers without the J chain was possible. Biolayer interferometry demonstrated that both IgM-Fc forms bind C1q and ELISA showed that they induce the in vitro C4b deposition when in solid phase. Additionally, our data confirmed the higher efficacy of IgM hexamers compared to pentamers in activating the first component of the classical pathway. Finally, hemolytic assays demonstrate the ability of IgM-Fc constructs to inhibit Ig-induced complement-dependent cytotoxicity, which is likely made possible by the absence of Fab.

In many molecules, fluorine is incorporated to enhance the half-life and improve bioavailability. Fluorinated compounds enter the human body through food, water, and xenobiotics including pharmaceuticals, exposing gut microbes to these substances. The human gut microbiota is known for its xenobiotic biotransformation capabilities, but it was not previously known whether gut microbial enzymes could break carbon-fluorine bonds, potentially altering the toxicity of these compounds. Here, through the development of a rapid, miniaturized fluoride detection assay for whole-cell screening, we discovered active gut microbial defluorinases. We biochemically characterized enzymes from diverse human gut microbial classes including Clostridia, Bacilli, and Coriobacteriia, with the capacity to hydrolyze (di)fluorinated organic acids and a fluorinated amino acid. Whole-protein alanine scanning, molecular dynamics simulations, and chimeric protein design enabled the identification of a disordered C-terminal protein segment involved in defluorination activity. Domain swapping exclusively of the C-terminus conferred defluorination activity to a non-defluorinating dehalogenase. To advance our understanding of the structural and sequence differences between defluorinating and non-defluorinating dehalogenases, we trained machine learning models which identified protein termini as important features. Models trained on 41-amino acid segments from protein C-termini alone predicted defluorination activity with 83% accuracy (compared to 95% accuracy based on full-length protein features).

We generated transcriptomes of intermediate and spinous cells and identified specific markers that distinguish these two populations. Further, we found that intermediate cells express a subset of genes in common with granular cells of the epidermis - the terminal living cell type that helps establish the barrier. Lineage tracing revealed that most intermediate cells directly transition to granular cells without expressing markers specific to spinous cells, thus revealing a distinct lineage pathway leading to granular fate. In addition to their transcriptional similarities, intermediate and granular cells both had hallmarks of increased actomyosin contractility. We found that rather than simply lying downstream of cell fate pathways, contractility was sufficient to suppress spinous fate and promote granular gene expression.

However, the three publications to date investigating underlying mechanisms disagree about the role of the Desmodium intercrop and whether it emits volatiles that repel FAW. Here, we synthesize knowledge on the effects of maize-Desmodium push-pull on FAW, report volatiles from two commonly used Desmodium species: Desmodium intortum and D. incanum, and test whether these affect the behavior of gravid FAW moths in bioassays. We detected 25 volatiles from field-grown Desmodium, many in the headspaces of both species, including volatiles previously reported to repel lepidopteran herbivores. In cage oviposition assays, FAW moths preferred to oviposit on maize over Desmodium, but not on maize further from, versus closer to Desmodium plants that were inaccessible to the moths, but sharing the air. In flight tunnel assays, moths approached the headspace of maize more than the shared headspace of maize and Desmodium, but pairwise differences were often insignificant. Thus, headspaces of Desmodium species include volatiles that could repel FAW moths, and gravid moths were generally more attracted to maize and its headspace than to either Desmodium species or mixed maize-Desmodium headspaces.

We also discovered that Src is an unrecognized pH-dependent kinase and mutation of the identified ionizable network abolishes pH-sensitive activity. Importantly, we found that Src kinase activity was pH sensitive even in the presence of EGF and with a phosphomimetic (Src-Y527E) mutant required for auto-inhibitory SH2 domain binding. Thus, the identified pH-sensitive regulation of Src kinase activity functions in concert with established mechanisms of Src regulation by phosphorylation.

Using genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches, we find that BEPs preferentially localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Despite having unrelated sequences, ER-localized BEPs converge on a shared protein feature, a C-terminal transmembrane domain, that enables recognition by conserved post-translational ER insertion pathways. From the ER, BEPs traffic from the ER to ultimately accumulate in the vacuole. Their homeostasis is regulated by conserved proteasomal and vacuolar degradation pathways. Our findings demonstrate that ancient membrane-associated systems can process young de novo proteins bearing a convergent protein feature.

Y.; Kim, Y.; Lee, S.-H.", "abstract": "Short-term facilitation of recurrent excitatory synapses within the cortical network has been proposed to support persistent activity during working memory tasks, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We characterized short-term plasticity at the local excitatory synapses in layer 2/3 of the rat medial prefrontal cortex and studied its presynaptic mechanisms. Low-frequency stimulation induced slowly developing facilitation, whereas high-frequency stimulation initially induced strong depression followed by rapid facilitation. This non-monotonic delayed facilitation after a brief depression resulted from a high vesicular fusion probability and slow activation of Ca2+-dependent vesicle replenishment, which led to the overfilling of release sites beyond their basal occupancy. Pharmacological and gene knockdown (KD) experiments revealed that the facilitation was mediated by phospholipase C/diacylglycerol signaling and synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7). Notably, Syt7 KD abolished facilitation and slowed the refilling rate of vesicles with high fusion probability. Furthermore, Syt7 deficiency in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons impaired the acquisition of trace fear memory and reduced c-Fos activity. In conclusion, Ca2+- and Syt7-dependent overfilling of release sites mediates synaptic facilitation at L2/3 recurrent excitatory synapses and contributes to temporal associative learning.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

The Drosophila female germline serves as an excellent model for studying these regulatory mechanisms. Here, we report that a previously uncharacterized gene CG14545, which we named sakura, is essential for oogenesis and female fertility in Drosophila. Sakura is predominantly expressed in the ovaries, particularly in the germline cells, including GSCs. sakura null mutant female flies display rudimentary ovaries with germline-less and tumorous phenotypes, fail to produce eggs, and are completely sterile. The germline-specific depletion of sakura impairs Dpp/BMP signaling, leading to aberrant bag-of-marbles (bam) expression, resulting in faulty differentiation and loss of GSCs. sakura is also necessary for normal levels of piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) levels and for female-specific splicing of sex-lethal (sxl), a master regulator of sex identity determination. We identified Ovarian Tumor (Otu) as a protein binding partner of Sakura and found that loss of otu phenocopies loss of sakura in ovaries. Thus, we identify Sakura as a crucial factor for GSC renewal and differentiation and oogenesis, and propose that Sakura and Otu function together in these processes.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

S.; Gregory, J. D.; Cheetham, C. E. J.", "abstract": "Postnatal neurogenesis occurs in only a few regions of the mammalian nervous system. Hence, neurons that are lost due to neurodegenerative disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury or peripheral neuropathy cannot be replaced. Transplantation of stem cell-derived neurons provides a potential replacement strategy, but how these neurons can be encouraged to functionally integrate into circuits remains a significant challenge. In the mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE), olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) continue to be generated throughout life from basal stem cells and can be repopulated even after complete ablation. However, the specialized population of navigator OSNs that ensures accurate odorant receptor-specific targeting of OSN axons to glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (OB) is only present perinatally. Despite this, some studies have reported complete regeneration of specific glomeruli, while others have found various degrees of recovery, following OSN cell death. Variability in the extent of both initial OSN ablation and subsequent repopulation of the OE, and the focus on anatomical recovery, leave the extent to which newly generated OSNs can reinnervate the OB unclear. Here, we employed the olfactotoxic drug methimazole to selectively ablate OSNs without damaging the basal stem cells that generate them, enabling us to assess the extent of functional recovery of OSN input to the OB in the context of complete OSN repopulation. We found profound deficits in the recovery of odor-evoked responses in OSN axons in the glomerular layer of the dorsal OB five weeks after OSN ablation, a time point at which OSNs are known to have repopulated the OE. Histological analysis of mature OSN axons in the OB at 10 and 20 weeks post-methimazole showed a persistent region-specific deficit in OSN axon reinnervation of the dorsal OB, with the dorsomedial region being particularly adversely affected. In contrast, reinnervation of the ventral, lateral and medial regions of the OB was almost complete by 10 weeks post-MMZ. Hence, we have identified a region-specific deficit in OSN reinnervation of the mouse OB, which sets the stage to identify the mechanisms that mediate successful vs. unsuccessful axonal regeneration in an endogenous population of stem cell-derived neurons.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Unlike mammals who cannot endogenously synthesize PUFAs, C. elegans can de novo synthesize PUFAs starting with the {Delta}12 desaturase FAT-2 which introduces a second double bond to monounsaturated fatty acids to generate the PUFA linoleic acid. FAT-2 desaturation is essential for C. elegans survival since fat-2 null mutants are non-viable; the near-null fat-2(wa17) allele synthesizes only small amounts of PUFAs and produces extremely sick worms. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we found that the fat-2(wa17) mutant has rigid membranes and can be efficiently rescued by dietarily providing various PUFAs, but not by fluidizing treatments or mutations. With the aim of identifying mechanisms that compensate for PUFA-deficiency, we performed a forward genetics screen to isolate novel fat-2(wa17) suppressors and identified four internal mutations within fat-2, and six mutations within the HIF-1 pathway. The suppressors increase PUFA levels in fat-2(wa17) mutant worms and additionally suppress the activation of the daf-16, UPRer and UPRmt stress response pathways that are active in fat-2(wa17) worms. We hypothesize that the six HIF-1 pathway mutations, found in egl-9, ftn-2, and hif-1 all converge on raising Fe2+ levels and in this way boost desaturase activity, including that of the fat-2(wa17) allele. We conclude that PUFAs cannot be genetically replaced and that the only genetic mechanism that can alleviate PUFA-deficiency do so by increasing PUFA levels.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

As one of the first MRSA strains isolated, COL has become a common model strain of S. aureus. Here we report that COL is, in fact, an atypical strain of MRSA that exhibits slow growth and multidrug tolerance. Genomic analysis identified three mutated genes in COL (rpoB, gltX and prs) with links to tolerance. Allele swapping experiments between COL and the closely related, non-tolerant Newman strain uncovered a complex interplay between these genes. However, Prs (phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate [PRPP] synthetase) accounted for most of the growth and tolerance phenotype of COL. Biochemical and transcriptomic analysis revealed that COL does not exhibit slow growth as a result of partial stringent response activation, as previously proposed. Instead, the COL Prs mutation greatly reduces the PRPP synthetase activity of the enzyme and leads to downregulation of pyrimidine, histidine and tryptophan synthesis, three pathways that rely on PRPP. Overall, our findings indicate that COL is an atypical, antibiotic-tolerant strain of MRSA whose isolation predates the previous first report of tolerance among clinical isolates.

A possible explanation for this inconsistency is the use of inappropriate proxies of sexual selection. Here, by focusing on swallows and allies (Aves: Hirundinidae), I examined whether or not a classic example of sexually selected trait, long outermost tail feathers, explains speciation rate in this clade. Long tails have been repeatedly shown to be intersexually selected in manipulative experiments, which is further corroborated by a series of macroevolutionary studies, thereby validating their use as a target of sexual selection. I found that hirundines with sexually dimorphic tail length have a significantly higher speciation rate than those with sexually monomorphic tail length. Furthermore, evolutionary changes in the extent of sexual tail dimorphism (and those in the extent of male outermost tail exaggeration) was significantly positively associated with speciation rate. Sexual plumage dichromatism and wing dimorphism are irrelevant to speciation rate. Together, the current study demonstrated the importance of using valid targets of sexual selection in studies on the macroevolutionary patterns of speciation. Using a classic, unidimensional sexual trait (i.e., long tail), I demonstrated a strong macroevolutionary support that divergence of intersexually selected traits promotes speciation.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Here, long timescale atomistic simulations were performed to directly probe voltage-induced gating transitions of the big potassium (BK) channels, where the voltage sensor domain (VSD) movement has been suggested to be distinct from that of canonical Kv channels but remains poorly understood. Using a Core-MT construct without the gating ring, multiple voltage activation transitions were observed at 750 mV, allowing detailed analysis of the activated state of BK VSD and key mechanistic features. Even though the S4 helix remains the principal voltage sensor in BK, its vertical displacement is only ~3 [A] and accompanied by significant lateral movements. The nature of the predicted VSD movement is in strong agreement with recent Cryo-EM structural studies of mutant BK channels with constitutively activated VSD. Free energy analysis based on the predicted activation transition yielded a total gating charge of 0.44 e per VSD, consistent with the experimental range of 0.48 - 0.65 e. We further show that the ability of modest physical movements with a small total gating charge to drive effective voltage gating of BK can be attributed to large gradients in the local electric field as reshaped by the protein. Furthermore, the S4 movement is coupled to the pore opening through a non-canonical pathway that involves the tightly packed S4-S5-S6 interface. These distinct mechanistic features may be relevant to voltage gating of other ion channels where VSDs are not domain-swapped with respect to the pore-gate domain.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Pangenome fluidity has been attributed to adaptive evolution, yet the underlying ecological drivers for bacterial pathogens persisting in natural reservoirs remain poorly understood. Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), a foodborne pathogen causing fatal listeriosis, serves as an ideal model for investigating the ecological mechanisms underlying pangenome fluidity in bacterial pathogens due to its high evolutionary divergence, broad ecological versatility, and significant public health concern. Through pangenome analysis of 177 Lm isolates representing three evolutionary lineages (I, II, and III) that we isolated from soils across the United States, we found that substantial genome variation was strongly associated with climatic factors (e.g. precipitation and temperature), soil properties (e.g. aluminum, pH, and molybdenum), and bacterial community composition, particularly Nitrospirae, Planctomycetes, Acidobacteria, and Cyanobacteria. These factors exerted selective pressure across many gene functions, with pronounced effects on genes involved in cell envelope synthesis, defense mechanisms, and replication, recombination, and repair. Among Lm lineages occupying varied habitats, distinct pangenome properties were observed. Lineage III exhibited a highly fluid pangenome, which was attributed to local adaptation to nutrient-limited conditions and strong dispersal limitation. In contrast, lineage I maintained a conserved pangenome, likely due to frequent homogenizing dispersal. Consistent with these dispersal patterns, we identified an elevated risk of soil-to-human transmission in lineage I, evidenced by epidemiological links between three soil-derived and 17 clinical isolates. Collectively, this study reveals the pivotal role of environmental selection imposed by both abiotic factors and bacterial communities in governing the adaptive pangenome evolution in bacterial pathogens.

Moreover, in these oligomers intramolecular vibrational coupling was detected between residues V18 and A30, as well as F20 and A30, in addition to intermolecular coupling between V18 amides, and between F20 and I32 residues. This indicates that these residues are close in the 3-dimensional structure (contact).

Using high-throughput drug screening of genetically-identical resistant clones with varying transcriptomes and morphologies, we show that each clone had a distinct drug sensitivity profile. These results admitted the possibility that there are drugs that are effective against only subsets of therapy resistant populations but in combination eliminate a large proportion of the resistant population. Using the individual clone sensitivity profiles, we prospectively identified combinations that were highly effective at eliminating most of the resistant population. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of \"subpopulation-directed synergy\", showing that considering population heterogeneity can reveal therapeutic opportunities otherwise masked by population averages, offering new strategies to combat therapy resistance.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we present a second-generation method, IL4Pred2, which is a host-specific approach designed to predict IL-4 inducing peptides separately for human and mouse hosts. All models were trained, tested, and benchmarked on experimentally validated data obtained from the IEDB. We employed a wide range of state-of-the-art techniques for prediction, including similarity-based approaches, machine learning, deep learning methods, and large language models. Our best model achieved highest AUC 0.80 with MCC 0.45 for human and AUC 0.82 with MCC 0.50 for mouse on independent set of main datasets. All models were trained, test and optimized on training dataset. We validate our final model on an independent dataset which is not used in training or hyperparameter optimization of models. In this study, we developed models on three types of datasets called Main, Alternate1 and Alternate2 for predicting IL-4 inducing peptides.

K.; Saddawi-Konefka, R.; Salanga, C.; Schokrpur, S.; Gutkind, J. S. K.; Handel, T. M.", "abstract": "The immune-suppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) has limited the impact of immune checkpoint blockade in many cancers, often by restricting the infiltration and activation of anti-tumoral CD8+ T, CD4+ T, and NK cells. Here, we utilized murine models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and demonstrated that intratumoral (IT) delivery of CXCL10 drives tumor elimination and inhibits recurrence. CD8+ T cells recruited to tumors display enhanced activation, increased tumor antigen specificity, and decreased markers of T cell exhaustion, indicating that CXCL10 not only directs cell migration, but also enhances T cell effector functions. Despite delivery of CXCL10 into tumors, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells also show enhanced presence and proliferation in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TdLNs), consistent with antigen presentation and trafficking of these cells between tumors and TdLNs. CXCL10 also stunts lymph- and hem-angiogenesis within the TME, which likely contributes to its antitumoral effects. Finally, enhanced tumor clearance was observed by combining IT CXCL10 and anti-PD-1. Together, these findings provide the rationale for the clinical evaluation of CXCL10 as a strategy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.\n\nSummaryCXCL10 suppresses tumor growth and promotes immune memory by recruiting and activating T and NK cells into the tumor microenvironment, promoting tumor-specific antigen recognition and effector functions, slowing T cell exhaustion, and inhibiting angiogenesis.

In this study, we describe the creation and characterization of the nanosd IGD targeting and inserted into the nanos gene of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae and show that it achieves high rates of gene drive (97.7% in females, 99.0% in males). We find that homozygous nanosd females but not males show impaired fecundity, and a variable loss of ovary phenotype. Transcriptomic analysis of ovaries points to decreased transcript levels of the nanos gene when harbouring Cas9. As a minimal genetic modification, nanosd does not induce widespread transcriptomic perturbations, and its susceptibility to Plasmodium spp. and Onyong nyong virus infection remains similar to wild-type mosquitoes. Importantly, we find that nanosd propagates efficiently in caged mosquito populations and is maintained as a source of Cas9 after the emergence of drive resistant alleles whilst also mobilising a non-autonomous antiparasitic effector modification.

All phytoplankton experience gravitational sinking, which can contribute to their vertical migration.

Here, we combine simulations and experiments to investigate the effects of nutrient availability on gravitational sinking in 9 diverse species of unicellular eukaryotic marine phytoplankton. Using measurements of cell mass, volume, and molecular composition, we find that most phytoplankton increase their gravitational sinking when starved, but the biophysical basis for the altered sinking varies across species and starvation conditions. For example, Chaetoceros calcitrans relies nearly exclusively on density regulation whereas Emiliania huxleyi relies on volume regulation. On the molecular level, the observed sinking changes are predominantly attributed to cellular dry contents, rather than water content. For example, starch accumulation increases sinking in 3 green algae species, and lipid accumulation decreases sinking in Phaeodactylum tricornutum.

This impairs contractility, hinders recovery and predisposes to arrhythmia. However, the key signals and cellular processes driving TATS loss are not understood. We investigated protein kinase C (PKC) and its downstream signals in animal and human cardiomyocytes. Methods Ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated from healthy adult rat, rabbit and failing human hearts and treated with the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristat 13-acetat (PMA) or receptor-mediated agonists, alongside inhibitors targeting PKC, PKD, NFkB, MKK1-ERK1/2, NFAT, or endocytic pathways. TATS density was analyzed by confocal microscopy using lipophilic membrane dyes. Signaling pathway activation was determined by Western blotting and RNA sequencing. Ca2+ signals and contractility were assessed in rat cells. Mechanisms of TATS loss were studied using endocytosis assays involving fixable dextran. Results PMA induced severe TATS loss, which was prevented by inhibiting PKC, PKD, NFkB or MKK1, but not by blocking NFAT or p38 MAPK. Receptor-mediated PKC activation also decreased TATS density. All effective inhibitors suppressed IkBa expression. RNA sequencing indicated PMA-mediated activation of the NFkB and MAPK/ERK pathways and genes related to endocytosis. NFkB inhibition did not suppress the MAPK pathway, but MKK inhibition suppressed NF{kappa}B. PMA decreased Ca2+ transient amplitudes and contractility, whereas NFkB inhibitors preserved both. Dextran assays revealed that TATS membranes were internalized via a macropinocytic process that followed saturation kinetics was upregulated by PMA, downregulated by NFkB inhibition, and required PI3K, myosin I, and clathrin-independent endocytosis and correlated with the rate of TATS loss. Key findings were consistent in human cardiomyocytes and in ex-vivo rat and rabbit myocardial slice culture. Conclusions PKC activation drives TATS loss in human and animal myocytes via PKC-PKD-NFkB, T-tubules are degraded by endocytic internalization, offering a new perspective on how cardiomyocyte membranes may deteriorate in heart disease.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Nitrate-induced Sialin2 scaffolds Lyn kinase with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at endosomes, activating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT-nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway to stimulate localized nitric oxide (NO) production, enhancing angiogenesis and cell survival.

First, we determined appropriate treatment concentrations using MTT assays, which demonstrated a dose dependent reduction in cell viability for all three compounds. Selected doses were applied to differentiating SGBS cells until day 14. Lipid droplet accumulation and free fatty acid release were assessed using Oil Red O (ORO) staining and a lipolysis assay kit, respectively. Gene expression of adipogenic and lipolytic markers was analysed by RT-PCR and TRPV1 receptor involvement was examined by immunofluorescence. A network pharmacology approach incorporating GeneCards, STITCH, and other databases revealed downregulation of PPARG, CEBPA, and FABP4, and upregulation of HSL, ATGL, and PLIN1. TRPV1 activation was prominent in capsaicin treated cells. Network analysis identified shared regulatory hubs such as PPARG, STAT3, and MTOR. All treatments significantly reduced lipid accumulation and increased lipolysis, with capsaicin showing the strongest effects. Combination treatments, especially capsaicin with caffeic acid, exhibited synergistic effects. While the previous studies showed interference of these compounds in the molecular pathways involved in fat cell metabolism, our work establishes for the first time potential thermogenic capacity of camphor individually and of combinatory effects of three compounds to inhibit adipogenesis and promote lipolysis in human adipocytes, potentially through TRPV1 signalling and modulation of metabolic gene networks.

The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathway plays a key role in inducing cardiac hypertrophy and in regulating specific protein translation. However, it is unclear how the specificity is achieved, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of protein translation remain unexplored. Methods: We employed single-molecule imaging of nascent peptides (SINAPs) reporters to visualize and analyze the translation dynamics in single adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and tracked active translation sites at high spatiotemporal resolution. We also examined the effects of adrenergic stimulation and the role of the ERK pathway in translation localization. Results: Our findings revealed that translation sites are primarily localized near Z-lines in cardiomyocytes, with some sites being highly dynamic and moving during translation. The 3 untranslated regions did not significantly change the localization of translation. Many translation sites co-localized with microtubules, and their movement predominantly occurred along microtubular tracks. Adrenergic stimulation led to a transient shift in translation activity toward the peri-nuclear region, peaking at 12 hours and requiring ERK pathway activity for this localization change. Conclusions: Our high-resolution single-cell study demonstrates that protein translation in cardiomyocytes is dynamic and responsive to hypertrophic stimuli in an ERK-dependent manner. The localized translation mechanism allows cardiomyocytes to rapidly adapt to changing environments by preferentially translating mRNAs in the peri-nuclear region.

We identify a 29bp 3'UTR motif in mRNA encoding TRAK2, a key determinant of mitochondria retrograde transport, that promotes cell-size-dependent targeting of TRAK2 mRNA to distal sites of cell protrusions. Cell-size-scaled mRNA polarisation in turn scales mitochondria distribution by defining the precise site of TRAK2-MIRO1 retrograde transport complex assembly. Consequently, 3'UTR motif excision perturbs size-regulated transport and eradicates scaling of mitochondria positioning, triggering distal accumulation of mitochondria and progressive hypermotility as cells increase size.

G.", "abstract": "Cdc42 is a Rho-family GTPase conserved across eukaryotes, where it plays essential roles in cell polarization. In single-celled yeast systems, Cdc42 is a key driver of symmetry breaking and polarized growth, forming zones of activity that locally recruit eRectors to organize the cytoskeleton and polarize secretion. Here we show that Cdc42 also functions in cell-cell fusion during Schizosaccharomyces pombe sexual reproduction but concentrates at the fusion site through mechanisms distinct from those proposed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Notably, the cdc42-mCherrySW allele (but not the cdc42-sfGFPSW allele), which is functional for cell polarization and has been used across organisms for dynamic studies, exhibits a strong fusion defect. These cells block fusion before cell wall digestion but after actin fusion focus formation, indicating that Cdc42 is required to translate the vesicle cluster into polarized cargo delivery. We trace the defect to instability of Cdc42-mCherrySW and demonstrate that cell fusion requires higher Cdc42 protein levels than mitotic polarized growth. Remarkably, by constructing an allelic series driving Cdc42 expression over a 5-fold range, we discover that polarized growth responds linearly to Cdc42 protein levels, whereas sexual reproduction exhibits a sharp switch-like response. Thus, the topology of the Cdc42 regulatory network is distinct for its polarization and mating functions.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

However, most evidence for this model is based on in vitro studies. Here we test the ability of Oskar variants to assemble functional germ plasm in vivo. We found that Vasa recruitment was largely unperturbed by LOTUS deletion or mutations in vivo. In contrast, nanos and pgc mRNA recruitment was affected by LOTUS domain perturbations, despite the current model attributing mRNA recruitment to the distinct OSK domain.

However, much remains unknown about the function, formation, and regulation of hornwort pyrenoids, especially as they are unaffected by changes in atmospheric CO2. Here, we tested whether submersion and hyperoxia induce pyrenoid formation and CCM. By subjecting Anthoceros agrestis, a pyrenoid-forming hornwort species, and A. fusiformis, which develops no pyrenoids, to a series of submersion experiments and analyzing their molecular, physiological, and cell-morphological response patterns using label-free proteomics and transmission electron microscopy, with additional in silico analysis, we identified a core set of CCM candidate genes. Under submersion, both species expressed CCM-associated protein homologs, whereas hyperoxia induced or diminished the expression of CCM-like homologs in a species-specific manner. We discovered that a carbonic anhydrase, a CAH3 homolog, as well as thylakoid bicarbonate transporter (LCI11-like) are upregulated under both conditions in A. agrestis, but not in A. fusiformis, suggesting that an algae-like mechanism of bicarbonate pumping into the thylakoid lumen and CO2 conversion exists in A. agrestis. Corroborating these molecular findings, an ultrastructural analysis of plastids revealed increases in pyrenoid-like structures and rearrangements during submersion in A. agrestis, whereas A. fusiformis accumulated lipid droplets between thylakoid stacks. Together, our data highlight hornworts' distinct acclimation strategies to adverse environmental conditions, highlighting the relevance of their pyrenoids and CCM.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Understanding how eCO2 affects susceptibility to biotic stress and alters leaf metabolism is critical for predicting forest responses to climate change. We examined the effects of eCO2 (+150 ppm) on 180-year-old Quercus robur at the Birmingham Institute of Forest Research (BIFoR) Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) facility. From 2016 (pre-treatment) to 2024 (year 8 of enrichment), we monitored natural powdery mildew infection and insect herbivory, alongside targeted and untargeted metabolomic profiling of leaf material collected across the growing season. While seasonal patterns and an overall decline in PM and herbivory were observed, no consistent differences in biotic stress incidence emerged due to eCO2. Metabolomic data revealed subtle but widespread shifts, especially in amino acid, CoenzymeA, and redox pathways. These results suggest that although eCO2 drives extensive metabolic changes, it does not alter biotic stress resistance in mature oaks. Instead, eCO2 appears to promote physiological plasticity that may shape future responses to combined environmental stressors.

To explore this, we compared the centromere and (epi)genome organization of two sister genera with contrasting centromere types: Chamaelirium luteum with large \"macro-monocentromeres\" and Chionographis japonica with holocentromeres. Both exhibit chromosome-wide histone phosphorylation patterns distinct from typical monocentric species.

Here, we constructed a unified single-cell reference framework by integrating scRNA-seq data from 11 distinct genetic and environmental ASD animal models, encompassing over 300.000 cells across various brain regions and developmental stages. Comparative analyses revealed convergent differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across neuronal and glial populations. Cross-model comparisons validated the integration, showing significant concordance between the unified dataset and individual studies, particularly for neuronal populations, and demonstrating how environmental models like valproic acid exposure recapitulate some of the transcriptomic alterations seen in genetic models. Cell communication analyses support widespread excitatory-inhibitory imbalance and with predicted signaling involving ligands like Pdgfa and Reln. Furthermore, we identified significant glial dysfunction, notably downregulation of crucial functional genes in astrocytes and signatures of metabolic dysregulation in mature oligodendrocytes. Cross-referencing with the SFARI database confirmed significant overlap with high-confidence ASD risk genes, with notable dysregulated in specific cell types included Ermn (upregulated in multiple glia), Foxg1 (downregulated in L5/6 NP neurons) and Mef2c (downregulated in MEIS2-like interneurons). Comparison with human scRNA-seq postmortem data revealed conserved dysregulation, highlighting enrichment of presynaptic/postsynaptic translation processes in neurons (implicating CACNAIA, GRIN2B, CAMK2A, ribosomal proteins) along with enrichment for neurodevelopmental disorder pathways in mature oligodendrocytes, involving NRXN and DLGAP gene networks.

In D. teissieri, for example, bam is not essential for GSC daughter differentiation. Here, we generated bam null alleles using CRISPR-Cas9 in a species more distantly related to D. melanogaster, D. americana, to interrogate whether bams essential GSC differentiation function is novel to the melanogaster species group or a function more basal to the Drosophila genus. To further characterize the extent of the functional flexibility of other GSC regulating genes, we generated a gene ortholog dataset for 366 GSC regulating genes essential in D. melanogaster across 15 additional Drosophila and two outgroup species. We find that bams essential GSC function is conserved between D. melanogaster and D. americana and therefore originated prior to the formation of the melanogaster species group. Additionally, we find that ~8% of the 366 GSC genes essential in D. melanogaster are absent in at least one of the 17 species in our ortholog dataset.

We first identified SEL1L through the study of Atypical Equine Thrombasthenia (AET), an autosomal recessive platelet disorder found in Thoroughbred horses. A missense variant in SEL1L (c.1810A>G p.Ile604Val) was found in AET-affected horses, which we show is associated with decreased protein expression. SEL1L is intracellular in equine platelets and localizes to the surface upon activation with thrombin. Platelets from homozygous horses exhibit significant decreases in spreading on immobilized collagen. Human megakaryocytes were found to have two SEL1L protein isoforms that increase in expression during megakaryopoiesis, although only one is delivered to mature platelets. Studies using inducible mouse and constitutive zebrafish knockouts demonstrate that SEL1L is necessary for efficient platelet or thrombocyte (fish equivalent) adhesion to sites of endothelial injury.

We introduce hedonic foraging as a mechanism by which hedonic evaluation guides behaviour via iterative reward maximisation. This framework integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference, whereby expected free energy encodes wanting--the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes--while variational free energy co responds to liking--the hedonic impact of the outcome. Hedonic foraging unifies the mechanisms underlying behaviours ranging from allostasis to art appreciation, casting cognition and motivated behaviour as purposive engagement with the environment and its affordances.\n\nLong abstractHedonic evaluation shapes behaviour across organisms. Yet, the mechanisms that transform hedonic values into motivated behaviour remain poorly understood, and key questions remain unanswered. How do habits, wanting, and liking or disliking interact to generate behaviour? Do common principles govern behaviour across species and cognitive systems, from basic survival mechanisms to complex cultural endeavours? We propose a unifying theory of motivated behaviour that integrates hedonic evaluation with active inference--a framework in which perception, action and cognition emerge from the imperative to minimise free energy. We argue that variational free energy provides a natural measure of liking and disliking, while expected free energy encodes wanting--the motivational drive toward rewarding outcomes. This synthesis, which we term hedonic foraging, offers a principled explanation for how organisms navigate their environments based on pleasure-driven learning and decision-making. It posits that motivated behaviour emerges from the fundamental pursuit of maximising reward, with hedonic evaluation motivating and monitoring actions through wanting and liking mechanisms. We demonstrate that hedonic foraging captures a wide range of behaviours, from allostatic processes common to all animals to sophisticated human activities such as art appreciation and cultural exploration. Crucially, our integrative perspective fosters mutual enrichment between hedonic evaluation and active inference--two fundamental approaches to behaviour. Ultimately, hedonic foraging reinforces the view that cognition is essentially about purposive engagement in adaptive interactions with the environment and its affordances and offers a unified framework for investigating cognition and behaviour.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

The recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology generated large-scale genomic and/or multi-omics datasets from different disease types or models. Owing to the huge volume of data coming out of genomic experiments, scientists are facing challenges in handling, manipulating, visualizing, and interpreting the data. Currently, available tools to visualize genetic variants from VCF files are not very user-friendly as most of them require knowledge of command line tools or scripts to install and run those software. Moreover, biologists or clinicians lack this knowledge of computer programming. Therefore, graphical user interface (GUI) based tools or software are needed to effectively summarize and visualize the huge volume of genomic data such as VCF data. Methods We have developed a Shiny App, interactive tool using the R programming language that utilizes other R packages like 'vcfR' and 'maftools' to visualize and generate quality control metrics for genetic data effectively and exquisitely. A key improvement is the addition of a user-friendly interface, providing researchers with an interactive way to explore VCF or Cancer genomics data. Our tool is powered by Shiny, making it even easier for researchers to analyze and visualize genomic variation data using a GUI. Researchers can upload their datasets and customize the analysis parameters to suit their specific research needs. Results A user-friendly interactive tool has been developed for the summarization and visualization of data related to genomic variation research. The application features an easy and friendly interface, allowing users to perform various functions such as data loading, summarization, and visualization interactively. XVCF offers an easy-to-use GUI platform to read genetic variant data (annotated or unannotated) and extract useful information such as read depth, mapping quality, genotype, quality control summary, and allele frequency from unannotated data. In the second module of XVCF, the cancer genomic data (annotated, so far supported by ANNOVAR) is analyzed using 'maftools' to produce oncoplot, comparison of mutational load across different TCGA datasets, gene summary, etc. XVCF is available for free download from https://github.com/rashidma/XVCF. Conclusion XVCF Shiny web application can serve as a robust visualization and quality control GUI platform for the germline and cancer genomics dataset. We expect this tool will be immensely useful for researchers with less computational or technical knowledge.

Advancing beyond previously published semi-automated (SA) marker-based watershed algorithms, we added structure enhancement, tensor voting, and output dilation to identify joint spaces. Segmentation was enhanced by the use of a DL joint space prediction model (3D U-Net architecture, ResNet-18 backbone) using wild-type (WT) hindpaw labels as ground truth. Prediction was then extended to hindpaws (52.4% in test group) and forepaws from WT and tumor necrosis factor transgenic (TNF-Tg) mice with inflammatory-erosive arthritis of both sexes across age. Segmentation accuracy improved dramatically using the DL methodology (WT male: SA 79.39+/-5.73% vs DL 98.16+/-1.47%, p<0.0001; WT female: SA 79.16+/-4.84% vs DL 99.19+/-1.63%, p<0.0001).

Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted by plants may be important in these interactions.

Amplicon sequencing revealed that bacterial and fungal communities differed significantly between gardens and among host population origins. Analysis of BVOC profiles showed that the camphene emission rate was associated with bacterial community composition, whereas that of {beta}-farnesene was linked to fungal community composition.

The advent of AI brings new advantages by enhancing phenotyping methods using imaging, making them more accessible to breeding programs. In this context, we have developed an open Python workflow for analyzing morphology and heritable morphometric traits using AI, which can be applied to fruits and other plant organs. This workflow has been implemented in almond (Prunus dulcis), a species where efficiency is critical due to its long breeding cycle. Over 25,000 kernels, more than 20,000 nuts, and over 600 individuals have been phenotyped, making this the largest morphological study conducted in almond. As result, new heritable morphometric traits of interest have been identified. These findings pave the way for more efficient breeding strategies, ultimately facilitating the development of improved cultivars with desirable traits.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

However, the molecular regulators of CAM induction remain poorly understood. Here, we generate the first single-nucleus transcriptome atlas of a CAM species, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum, to resolve transcriptional dynamics at the cell-type level during the C3-to-CAM transition. Using snRNA-seq and a 24-hour time-course bulk RNA-seq dataset, we identify PPCK1, a key CAM enzyme regulator, as part of a co-expression network enriched in circadian clock genes and salt-induced pathways. We demonstrate that the ice plant HY5 (McHY5) directly activates PPCK1, a function absent in the C3 model species Arabidopsis thaliana. This discovery reveals a fundamental divergence in transcription factor activity between a CAM and a C3 species, suggesting that CAM evolution in M. crystallinum involved a rewiring of core regulatory elements underlying CAM. Identifying a transcription factor that directly controls a major CAM gene provides a key step toward decoding CAM regulatory architecture and opens new avenues for engineering drought-resilient crops.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Domestication and selection influence the accumulation of alleles occurring across a range of deleteriousness. Evidence suggests that mildly deleterious mutations (DelMut) can be purged out of breeding populations, increasing favorable allele accumulation. We used phylogeny-based analyses among 36 legume genomes to identify selection signatures and predict DelMut in common bean. We also developed a multiparent advanced generation intercrossed (MAGIC) population of black beans to characterize DelMut. Genes involved in nitrogen metabolism showed signs of positive selection in the Middle American genome, whereas genes related to phosphorylation were positively selected in the Andean genome. By combining conservation and protein information with machine learning (ML) for high-dimensional feature analysis, we characterized 82,442 sites in the MAGIC founders (36,558 polymorphic) and 4,753 sites evenly sequenced among RILs that could be potentially deleterious. Variation in the number of highly DelMut (high predicted deleterious scores) among lines was observed and later correlated with agronomic traits. Phenotypic analyses showed that calculated genetic load (and number of highly DelMut) was negatively correlated with flowering time, maturity, and yield. A detailed in-silico analysis of predicted mutations showed presence in highly conserved protein regions, which is likely to affect protein functionality. Our results show that variation in genetic load can be observed in breeding populations and potentially impact plant performance.

Arabidopsis is the key genetic model for plants but monitoring these sorts of physiological processes presents significant challenges using traditional gas-exchange or fluorescence-based techniques due to the small size of intact Arabidopsis thaliana (arabidopsis) seedlings. Here, we validate and characterize the use of Clark-type oxygen electrodes, specifically the Hansatech Oxytherm+P system, to quantify both photosynthetic and respiratory activity in intact arabidopsis seedlings. By monitoring oxygen evolution in dark and light phases, we demonstrate that oxygen consumption and production correspond to mitochondrial respiration and photosynthesis, respectively. These processes were modulated by tissue biomass, light intensity, developmental stage, and stress conditions. Specific inhibitors such as potassium cyanide and paraquat confirmed that the recorded changes in oxygen concentrations reflected mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase activity and photosystem electron transport-dependent oxygen production, respectively. Moreover, oxygen evolution increased significantly with bicarbonate supplementation, validating the system's sensitivity to carbon fixation. We further showed that photosynthetic activity measured with this method correlates with a quantitative green index and responds dynamically to de-etiolation, abiotic stress (salt, osmotic, oxidative), and temperature shifts. Our study lays the groundwork for measuring photosynthesis based on oxygen evolution and respiration in arabidopsis knockout mutants, CRISPR lines, overexpression lines and ecotypes using Clark-type oxygen electrodes and highlights key considerations and limitations to consider when applying this approach.

Experiments were conducted on M. pudica in Cuajiniquil, Costa Rica. Petiole angle change was recorded following repeated P1 stimuli, both with (P3 group) and without (NS-P3 group) concurrent tertiary pulvinus (P3) activation. Results showed the highest mean petiole angle change and P1 activations at the first stimulus, with a significant decline at the second stimulus and sustained lower responses thereafter. Both the NS-P3 and P3 groups exhibited similar overall behavior, characterized by a sharp decline in petiole angle change and P1 activation counts after the first stimulus. However, the P3 group had a lower initial petiole angle change compared to the NS-P3 group, and exhibited significant wave-like behavior, suggesting a more pronounced refractory period due to the combined activation of both P1 and P3 pulvini.

Diverse measures of biological age, referred to as clocks, have been developed in recent years and enable risk assessments, and an estimation of the efficacy of longevity interventions in animals and humans. While most clocks are trained to predict chronological age, clocks have been developed to predict more complex composite biological age outcomes, at least in humans. These composite outcomes can be made up of a combination of phenotypic data, chronological age, and disease or mortality risk. Here, we develop the first such composite biological age measure for mice: the mouse phenotypic age model (Mouse PhenoAge). This outcome is based on frailty measures, complete blood counts, and mortality risk in a longitudinally assessed cohort of male and female C57BL/6 mice. We then develop clocks to predict Mouse PhenoAge, based on multi-omic models using metabolomic and DNA methylation data. Our models accurately predict Mouse PhenoAge, and residuals of the models are associated with remaining lifespan, even for mice of the same chronological age. These methods offer novel ways to accurately predict mortality in laboratory mice thus reducing the need for lengthy and costly survival studies.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

It remains unclear what the temporal dynamics are of this generalization, and to which processing stages it is linked. Here we investigated the neural correlates of peripherally encoded memoranda before and after an item was selected for response, focusing on when the representation changes from a location-specific to a spatially generalized code. Thirty healthy participants memorized two orientations presented serially at 15 degrees eccentricity to the left and right of central fixation. One of the two items was subsequently cued, for which memory performance was then assessed. During the delays between each of these events, impulse signals were presented to trace memoranda in potentially activity-silent or activity-reduced states. Replicating prior findings, we observed that neural codes transitioned from dynamic, location-specific states to spatially and temporally generalized stable states post-encoding, here emerging from about 400 ms onwards. Importantly, this already occurred during maintenance, prior to selection of the response-relevant item. After the cue, first the location, and then the identity of the cued item emerged in the signal, suggesting that, despite the by then generalized code, location remained a useful basis for selection.

Previous studies have demonstrated the value of tDCS for modulating sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, nevertheless, knowledge about how externally applied electric fields affect different components of neuronal networks is still incomplete, and in vivo animal models, which are required for a deeper understanding, are not fully developed. To evaluate the impact of tDCS on cortical excitability, many human experiments assess motor evoked potentials elicited by motor cortex (M1) stimulation. To develop a related in vivo animal model, we recorded electrical activity in M1 of alert mice during and after administration of tDCS over M1. M1 excitability was chronically recorded from layers 2-3, layer 5 and layer 6, evoked by stimulation of the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus (VAL). M1-tDCS was applied at 100 and 200 A for 5 s to test the acute effects on neuronal excitability, and for 15 min to induce after-effects. Acute M1-tDCS increased and decreased the amplitude of VAL-evoked potentials in a polarity-, layer- and intensity-dependent manner. For 15 minutes of anodal or cathodal tDCS, a similar polarity- and intensity-dependent modulation of VAL-evoked potential amplitudes during the 15 minutes of stimulation was observed. After tDCS was switched off, the highest intensity of anodal stimulation induced a significant excitability enhancement during at least two hours after stimulation, whereas the after-effects of cathodal tDCS were less pronounced. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of a mouse model of M1-tDCS to accomplish similar modulatory effects of tDCS on cortical excitability as observed in human experiments. A proper adjustment of tDCS parameters, as compared to application in humans, is however required to obtain these translational effects.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Our results show that both relationship quantity (having many association partners) and relationship quality (having strong associations) are linked with survival.

However, sample-induced wavefront distortions of emitted fluorescent light as it passes through the sample and onto the detector often yield point spread function (PSF) aberrations, presenting an important challenge to 3D particle tracking using pre-calibrated PSFs. PSF calibration is typically performed outside cellular samples, ignoring sample-induced aberrations, which can result in localization errors on the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers, ultimately compromising sub-diffraction limited tracking. In practice, correcting sample-induced aberrations currently requires sample-specific hardware adjustments, such as adaptive optics. Yet, information on sample-induced aberrations and PSF shape can be directly decoded from data collected using a 3D imaging setup. To this end, we propose a framework for simultaneous particle tracking, pupil function learning, and PSF reconstruction directly from the input data themselves. To accomplish this, we operate within a Bayesian paradigm, placing continuous 2D priors on all possible pupil phase and amplitudes warranted by the data without limiting ourselves to a finite Zernike set--thereby allowing capture of intricate pupil phase details. We benchmark our framework using a wide range of synthetic and experimental data from static to diffusing particles, and generalize to multiple diffusing particles with overlapping PSFs. Further, as a result of simultaneous particle tracking, phase retrieval, and PSF reconstruction, we retrieve the pupil phase with errors smaller than 10% under a range of realistic scenarios, while restoring sub-diffraction limited localization precisions of 10-25nm and 20-50nm in lateral and axial directions, respectively.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

This method does not require complete resonance assignments, though it can incorporate experimental chemical shifts when available to improve performance. The simulated spectra are generated from postulated resonance assignments, which can be derived either from empirical database predictions, direct interpretation, or a hybrid combination. BPHON employs a physics-based approximate polarization transfer model to predict cross-peak intensities from the internuclear distances in the decoy structure, and models the peak lineshapes using empirical, bulk T2 relaxation rates and literature values for scalar couplings. The resulting simulated spectra are scored relative to the experimental data by normalized cross correlation, yielding a fitness score between 0 and 1. We demonstrate BPHON's ability to discriminate structural models, particularly in the case of 13C-detected magic angle spinning solid-state NMR spectra.

FRAP is based on the spatiotemporal imaging of fluorescent molecules following an initial bleaching of fluorescence in a region of the sample. Although a large number of methods have been developed to infer kinetic parameters from experiments, it is still a challenge to fully characterize molecular dynamics from noisy experiments in which diffusion is coupled to other molecular processes or in which the initial bleaching profile is not perfectly controlled. To address this challenge, we have developed HiFRAP to quantify the reaction-(or exchange-)diffusion kinetic parameters from FRAP under imperfect experimental conditions. HiFRAP is based on a low-rank approximation of a kernel related to the model Green's function and is implemented as an ImageJ/Python macro for (potentially curved) one-dimensional systems and for two-dimensional systems. To the best of our knowledge, HiFRAP offers features that have not been combined together: making no assumption on the initial bleaching profile, which does not need to be known; accounting for the limitation of the optical setup by diffraction; inferring several kinetic parameters from a single experiment; providing errors on parameter estimation; and testing model goodness. In the future, our approach could be applied to other dynamical processes described by linear partial differential equations, which could be useful beyond FRAP, in experiments where the concentration fields are monitored over space and time.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

To fully leverage UHF magnets for magic-angle-spinning SSNMR, it is essential to eliminate linebroadening arising from magnetic field drift and couplings among the nuclear spins. We address these challenges using an external 2H lock to compensate the field drift and Long-Observation-Window Band-Selective Homonuclear Decoupling (LOW-BASHD) to suppress 13C homonuclear couplings. We thereby achieve better than 0.2 ppm resolution in proteins up to 144 kDa, enabling unique site resolution for over 500 amide backbone pairs in 2D experiments.

While solution NMR employs deuterium lock sys-tems, most SSNMR probes still lack this capability; though a lock corrects for magnet drift and instabilities, it is not alone sufficient to account for field gradients, sample temperature differences, and pulse sequence effects that can contribute to ref-erencing errors among several data sets. These offsets become particularly problematic in the lengthy multidimensional ex-periments that provide the foundation for resonance assignment and structure determination procedures. Currently, researchers rely on manual alignment through visual peak inspection--a qualitative approach that often overemphasizes prominent, out-lying peaks while overlooking subtle, global patterns. This subjective process becomes increasingly impractical for use cases with lower sensitivity, such as large proteins with thousands of peaks. To address these challenges, here we present Auto-mated NMR Spectral Alignment (ANSA), a program that adapts cryo-electron microscopy motion correction principles to NMR spectroscopy. ANSA treats NMR spectra as images and applies cross-correlation functions to determine optimal align-ment, improving cross-correlation scores from 0.33 to 1.00 in controlled tests and achieving 0.96 correlation in real-world applications with previously misaligned spectra. The algorithm successfully aligns spectra across varying experimental con-ditions, corrects shifts in long-duration experiments, and works with 2D and 3D datasets, with approaches that can be readily extended to additional dimensions. By eliminating human bias and providing objective, consistent spectral alignment, ANSA enhances scientific rigor, improves reproducibility between experiments, and enables automation of critical data pro-cessing steps.

The X2 may be composed of individual contributions from lattice disorder (LT), static conformational heterogeneity (H) throughout the lattice, rigid body vibration (RB), local conformational vibration (V), and zero-point atomic fluctuation (A). The Bf has been widely employed as a surrogate measure of local protein flexibility, although such relation has not been confirmed. In addition, reproducibility of the absolute B-factor is difficult to achieve, hampering the understanding of their individual contribution. Here we report the crystallographic investigation of the enzyme-ligand complex of trypsin with benzamidine from cryo to room temperature, through a 200 K range (9-point triplicate design), by crystal stabilization with hydrophobic grease enabling data collection beyond the protein glass transition (~200 K). The extent of temperature-induced conformational changes showed no connection with their respective B-factors. The B-factor variation due to temperature was constant for all atoms of the system, of about 0.005 K-1. The results caution against interpreting absolute, normalized or zero-point B-factors as direct proxies for protein dynamics, which is further supported by structural analysis of data from independent groups with trypsin-benzamidine complexes obtained under dissimilar experimental conditions. The similar thermal dependence of B-factor for all atoms of the system suggests a major contribution of this physical variable over uniform rigid body vibration.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

In photothrombosis (PT)-induced cortical stroke model, PT triggered H2O2 surge, astrogliosis, glial barrier formation, COL1 expression, fibrotic scarring, altered N-glycosylation, neuronal loss, and neurological deficits.

To address this, we collected patient-matched tumor tissue, distant normal tissue, metastasis, and draining lymph nodes to generate a large-scale single-cell immune profiling dataset from 64 patients (n=179 samples, >150,000 cells). From single cell analysis, we identified two distinct sources of impaired tumor surveillance within tumor draining lymph nodes. First, we observed that a significant fraction of tumor draining lymph nodes had undergone cytokine-driven reprogramming, leading to reduced dendritic cell homing and limited T cell priming. Second, T cells undergoing successful activation exhibited limited expansion and constrained differentiation, marked by expression of the quiescence-associated transcription factor Kruppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2). Overexpression of KLF2 in primary T cells limited both their differentiation and cytotoxic capacity. These findings implicate both impaired T cell priming and KLF2-dependent T cell quiescence in limiting T cell immunity in gastric adenocarcinoma.

Among these is dengue virus (DENV), a flavivirus whose global infection rates continue to rise each year. With limited options available for preventing or treating DENV infections, mosquito control remains the most widely implemented strategy to combat DENV transmission. Due to the global distribution of DENV, which infects an estimated 400 million people per year, vector suppression practices vary drastically by country and/or region and even small differences in microenvironment can significantly impact vector abundance. There remains a significant need to better understand vector exposure rates at an individual level to disentangle vector exposure and arboviral infection rates. To this end, we have optimized a serologic assay to assess the abundance of antibodies directed against the mosquito salivary proteins AeD7L1+2 as a surrogate metric of vector exposure. Utilizing this assay, we found that anti-D7L1+2 IgG levels were unable to identify low levels of Aedes exposure in individuals with limited prior Aedes exposure, indicating they are unreliable markers of an individuals recent exposure to low levels of these vectors. However, antibody levels against D7L1+2 were robust in plasma samples from individuals living in Aedes endemic regions. These antibody levels reflected seasonal changes in Aedes abundance and exposure, indicating their potential for use as an aggregate marker of vector exposure. Additionally, we found that there were slight negative associations with anti-D7L1+2 IgG levels and age in our cohort. Interestingly, we also found that lower titers of anti-AeD7L1+2 IgG correlated with higher infection burden in households.

This work examines the structural and optical properties of Au-NCs interacting with bioengineered IDPs containing up to three cysteines. We show that, by exploiting the conformational flexibility of cysteine-containing IDPs, we can anchor proteins to Au-NCs in a position-specific man-ner, leading to new bioconjugates with properties that differ from those of the individual components.

Although extensive experimental studies have characterized polymer-protein interactions, computational studies remain limited due to the inherent difficulty of modeling and integrating these distinct components within a unified system. This study presents molecular modeling and simulation of polyelectrolyte and polyzwitterionic brushes - poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA), poly(2-(N-oxide-N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PNOMA), and poly(2-(N-3-sulfopropyl-N,N-dimethylammonium)ethyl methacrylate) (PSBMA) - grafted onto -quartz substrates. The brush models were developed to closely replicate experimentally synthesized brush samples and to provide detailed insights into structural and dynamical changes at the molecular level during protein adsorption. Using steered molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the PSBMA brush, due to its high local density, exhibits the greatest resistance to protein insertion. C root-mean-square deviation and interaction patterns analyses further reveal that PSBMA also induces the most significant destabilization of lysozyme, while PDMAEMA brush enhances protein stability through ion-mediated interactions. The PNOMA brush, while requiring the lowest force for protein adsorption, induces greater protein destabilization than the PDMAEMA brush primarily due to electrostatic repulsion caused by a short carbon spacer length. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first comprehensive and realistic model system - comprising nanomaterials, polymers, and proteins, specifically antifouling polyzwitterions and polyelectrolytes grafted onto -quartz substrates via linkers.

The first stage employs a convolutional and recurrent neural network, adapted from the Deep-Channel multi-channel classifier, to accurately classify raw current recordings into discrete conductance states, including partially blocked sub-conductance intermediates. The second stage, peptide classification, utilizes a novel branched input network with a temporal convolutional network for processing translocation event conductance state sequences and a dense network for incorporating computed event-level and global kinetic features. Using idealized simulated multi-state translocation data for seven peptides, we demonstrate high classification accuracy (0.99) when global features are included alongside event-level features. For classifying mixture samples, where only event-level features are applicable, performance is more modest (0.68 accuracy). Peptide mixture predictions showed reasonable accuracy (MAE 0.045-0.161), although misclassification resulted in false positives. Event stochasticity and the fact that some peptides possessed similar kinetic parameters posed challenging for event-level prediction. However, vote aggregation from translocation event streams achieves perfect 100% accuracy, when predicting pure peptide samples.

Notably, the unmodified AlphaFold3-type baseline failed to predict any of the eight complexes, underscoring the difficulty of sampling ternary conformations. By contrast, our FK-steered diffusion approach-FKSFold-successfully predicted 3 of the 8 cases in these early trials.

KdpB belongs to the superfamily of P-type ATPases with a conserved binding site for ions within the membrane domain and three cytoplasmic domains that orchestrate ATP hydrolysis via an aspartyl phosphate intermediate. Previous work has hypothesized that K+ moves parallel to the membrane plane through a 40-[A] long tunnel that connects the selectivity filter of KdpA with the binding site in KdpB. In the current work, we have reconstituted KdpFABC into lipid nanodiscs and used cryo-EM to image the wild-type pump under turnover conditions. We present a 2.1 [A] structure of the E1~P{middle dot}ADP conformation, which reveals new features of the conduction pathway. This map shows exceedingly strong densities within the selectivity filter and at the canonical binding site, consistent with K+ bound at each of these sites in this conformation. Many water molecules occupy a vestibule and the proximal end of the tunnel, which becomes markedly hydrophobic and dewetted at the subunit interface. We go on to use ATPase and ion transport assays to assess effects of numerous mutations along this proposed conduction pathway. The results confirm that K+ ions pass through the tunnel and support the existence of a low affinity site in KdpB for releasing these ions to the cytoplasm.

To systematically identify regulators of phagocytosis, we performed genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens in human leukemia cells co-cultured with human monocyte-derived macrophages. Surprisingly, we found that whereas the classic ''don't eat me'' signal CD47 inhibited mouse macrophages, it did not inhibit phagocytosis by human macrophages. In contrast, the O-linked glycosylation and sialylation pathways were strong negative regulators of phagocytosis. In AML, the cell surface O-linked glycoprotein CD43 was the major effector of the O-linked glycosylation and sialylation pathways. Genetic deletion or antibody blockade of CD43 enhanced macrophage phagocytosis. This work highlights the importance of using human platforms to identify immune checkpoints, and nominates CD43 as a glyco-immune regulator of human macrophage phagocytosis.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

In the realm of biomolecules, embeddings serve as efficient sequence and/or structure representations, enabling similarity searches, structure and function prediction, and estimation of biophysical and biological properties. However, relying on embeddings without assessing the model's confidence in its ability to accurately represent molecular properties is a critical flaw - akin to using a scalpel in surgery without verifying its sharpness. In this study, we propose a means to evaluate the ability of protein language models to represent proteins, assessing their capacity to encode biologically relevant information. Our findings reveal that low-quality embeddings often fail to capture meaningful biology, displaying vector properties indistinguishable from those of randomly generated sequences. A key contributor to this performance issue is the models' failure to learn the underlying biology from unevenly distributed sequence spaces in the training data. Our novel, model-agnostic scoring framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to quantify protein sequence embedding reliability. We believe that our robust approach to screening embeddings prior to making biological inferences, stands to significantly enhance the reliability of downstream applications.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is ubiquitous in human genes, resulting in mRNA diversity, and has been validated to play a pivotal regulatory role in the onset and progression of a variety of diseases, including viral infections. Here, we analyzed the APA usage across different cell types in frontal cortex cells from non-viral control group and COVID-19 patients, and identified functionally related APA events in COVID-19. According to our study, the poly(A) site (PAS) usage is different among cell types and following SARS-COV-2 infection. Moreover, we found the genes with significant PAS level changes affected pathways related to RNA splicing, and neuronal development and function, suggesting that survivors of COVID-19 will have a high risk of these diseases and that alternative splicing functions cause these changes. Additionally, APA usage and its correlation with gene expression levels varied across genes, some prefer short isoform that is more stable to produce more proteins, while others may be regulated by different mechanisms. A total of 267 risk genes targeted by microRNAs for common neurological and psychiatric disorders were found to undergo significant changes in APA following infection. In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis of APA in neural cells from COVID-19 patients at the single-cell level elucidated changes in APA levels in the brains of SARS-COV-2-infected patients and confirmed that these changes impair the function of the nervous system, providing important insights for COVID-19-associated sequelae.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Recycling of spent media, specifically certain abundant metabolites such as lactic acid, offers an opportunity for valorization and to offset the carbon footprint of cultivated meat production, however, the feasibility of recovering lactic acid from spent media has yet to be examined in detail. In this study, we developed a conceptual design of a five-step lactic acid recovery process integrated into a previously modeled cultivated meat facility. We examined the corresponding cost and environmental impacts of recovering an 88% aqueous, polymer-grade lactic acid solution and compared these footprints to data from commercial lactic acid fermentation processes. At an anticipated lactic acid concentration in spent media of 3 g/L, we found that the net cost of recovery would be $0.71 per kg of 88% lactic acid, with a 7.5 year simple payback period. Sales of this co-product could offset $0.06/kg of the cost associated with the production of cultivated meat. Depending on allocation scenarios, the environmental impact of the recovery process had a -1.0 to +0.2 kg CO2 eq effect on the overall carbon footprint and a -22 to +3 MJ effect on cumulative energy demand per kg of cultivated meat production. These results suggest that the recovery of lactic acid may be an economically viable and environmentally beneficial practice if implemented in future production facilities. This study provides crucial guidance for lactic acid valorization and other media recycling strategies for cultivated meat that can be applied to broader animal cell biomanufacturing industries.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

The test results for the system during independent use of the amplifier and during simultaneous use of the amplifier and stimulator are presented. As seen in the circuit analysis, test results confirm that the charge storage that occurs in the tissue/electrode interface used for stimulation interferes with the measurement of the neural signals of interest when the two circuits share electrodes.

Resistance to the frontline antifungal fluconazole (FLZ) in Candida spp. is commonly acquired through gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in the gene encoding the transcription factor Mrr1. These activated Mrr1 variants enhance FLZ efflux via upregulation of the multi-drug transporter gene MDR1. Recently, it was reported that, unlike in the well-studied Candida albicans species, C. lusitaniae and Candida parapsilosis with activated Mrr1 also have high expression of CDR1, which encodes another multi-drug transporter with overlapping but distinct transported substrate profiles and Cdr1-dependent FLZ resistance. To better understand the mechanisms of Mrr1 regulation of MDR1 and CDR1, and other co-regulated genes, we performed CUT&RUN analysis of Mrr1 binding sites. Mrr1 bound the promoter regions of MDR1 and CDR1 as well as FLU1, which encodes another transporter capable of FLZ efflux. Mdr1 and Cdr1 independently contributed to the decreased susceptibility of the MRR1GOF strains against diverse clinical azoles and other antifungals, including 5-flucytosine. A consensus motif, CGGAGWTAR, enriched in Mrr1-bound C. lusitaniae DNA was also conserved upstream of MDR1 and CDR1 across species including C. albicans. CUT&RUN and RNA-seq data were used to define the Mrr1 regulon which includes genes involved in transport, stress responses, and metabolism. Activated and inducible Mrr1 bound similar regions in the promoters of Mrr1 regulon genes. Our studies provide new evolutionary insights into the coordinated regulation of multi-drug transporters and potential mechanism(s) that aid secondary resistance acquisition in emerging Candida.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

While their direct bactericidal mechanisms are well-characterized, how bacteria sense and respond to these peptides at sublethal concentrations remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the activation of the Escherichia coli PhoQ-PhoP signaling system by the human cathelicidin LL-37 and its derivatives (KR-12 and RI-10). We demonstrate that these peptides exhibit variable antimicrobial potency but surprisingly similar abilities to activate the PhoQ-PhoP pathway, indicating that signaling function is separable from bactericidal activity. Notably, sublethal concentrations of these peptides induce significant cell elongation, a phenotype dependent on PhoQ and mediated by the upregulation of QueE, which interferes with bacterial cell division. Contrary to the previous model suggesting peptides activate PhoQ passively by displacing its inhibitor MgrB, we observed enhanced cell elongation in {Delta}mgrB strains across all tested peptides, including RI-10, lacking antibacterial activity. Our findings suggest peptides actively stimulate PhoQ through a mechanism independent of MgrB dissociation, providing a more refined understanding of the peptide signaling through the PhoQ-PhoP system.

Through competition assays, gene expression analysis, and siderophore quantification, we demonstrate that Salmonella increasingly relies on exogenous siderophores under acidic conditions. This shift is attributed to reduced production of its endogenous siderophores, enterobactin and salmochelin. Deletion of the sigma factor RpoS enhances endogenous siderophore production and iron acquisition at low pH, suggesting its role in regulating iron homeostasis.

We measured expression of five candidate immune genes in B. sudanica 8, 24, and 72 hours post-exposure to S. mansoni using reverse transcription quantitative PCR. Expression patterns of resistant snails were compared to susceptible snails and those sham exposed. We also assessed how diet (lettuce vs. pellet) affected expression of three genes, given prior findings that pellet-fed snails were more susceptible to S. mansoni. Results indicated that resistant snails constitutively expressed higher levels of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) than susceptible snails, consistent with expression patterns of resistant B. glabrata. Parasite-induced expression occurred at 8 hours in SOD1, biomphalysin, thioester protein 1 (TEP1), and granulin (GRN); however, for biomphalysin and TEP1, induced expression was only detected for susceptible snails. At 24 hours, biomphalysin expression increased in exposed resistant snails, and at 72 hours, all exposed snails decreased biomphalysin expression compared to controls. Parasite-induced expression of SOD1, biomphalysin, TEP1, and GRN supports the hypothesis that these genes play a role in B. sudanica anti-schistosome defense, however increased expression does not necessarily yield clearance of S. mansoni. SOD1 expression was higher in lettuce-fed snails at 8 and 24 hours, consistent with their greater resistance.

While Toxin A and Toxin B are thought to drive the pathology associated with the disease, strains that produce CDT have been linked to increased disease severity, higher rates of infection recurrence, and increased incidence of mortality. A basic understanding of how CDT intoxicates host cells has emerged over the past two decades and includes a framework that relies on the oligomerization of the components that comprise CDT to promote cellular intoxication. Although several key steps of this process have been biochemically described, a clear, molecular description of toxin assembly has not been resolved. We have collected cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM) data of purified, recombinant CDTb. From these data, we have generated several structural snapshots of the toxin, including a series of structures that correspond to intermediates that form during oligomerization. These structures provide insight into the mechanism underlying toxin assembly and highlight a role for structural plasticity during this process.

Comparative genomic analyses revealed that NC-SV-like prophages and svsR homologs are conserved across diverse Enterobacteriaceae. Transcriptional analyses reveal that svsR represses maltodextrin transport genes, including lamB, which encodes the outer membrane maltoporin LamB--a known receptor for multiple phages.

Although intestinal E. coli densities remained stable across groups, animals colonized with NC101 exhibited markedly reduced phage burdens in both the intestinal lumen and mucosa compared to mice colonized with NC101deltaNC-SV.

In this study, we aim to address this research gap by establishing a bioinformatics pipeline to mine genomes of extremely and moderately thermophilic microorganisms for signatures of potential polyhydroxyalkanoate production. Based on a collection of verified protein sequences of polyhydroxyalkanoate polymerase PhaC, the key biosynthetic enzyme, carefully curated sets of thermophilic bacterial and archaeal genomes were screened. This revealed that although PhaC-encoding genes are prevalent in diverse moderately thermophilic bacteria, they are absent in the considered extreme thermophilic bacteria. In contrast, a few limited examples of extreme thermophilic archaea were found to encode putative phaC genes embedded within a typical polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis operon in their genomes, namely within the genera Ferroglobus, Geoglobus and Archaeoglobus, while no hits were found in extreme thermophilic bacteria. The latter included Thermus thermophilus, which was previously reported as a polyhydroxyalkanoates producer. This was refuted in our bioinformatics analysis and moreover, the predicted absence of polyhydroxyalkanoates synthesis in T. thermophilus was experimentally confirmed by employing various extraction and analytical methods.

In this study, we examined the role of the sugar maltose in Salmonella Typhimurium (STM) growth under nitrogen-deficient conditions and the pathogenicity of Salmonella in the early phases of infection in C57BL/6 mice and colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2 cells). Bacteria grown under nitrogen-deficient conditions with maltose supplementation showed enhanced growth with reduced Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) expression, leading to reduced invasion of Caco-2 cells and reduced organ burden in C57BL/6 mice. Even without nitrogen starvation, maltose supplementation at lower concentrations inhibited STM colonisation in the ileum of mice. In the cell line model, deleting the maltose metabolism gene (malQ) leads to increased adhesion due to increased expression of type 1 fimbriae. We propose that maltose modulates Salmonella survival by aiding growth under nitrogen-deficient conditions, and it is detrimental to bacterial infection in epithelial cells.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Genomic studies can facilitate our better understanding the relationships among the vast array of diverse, and frequently, mobilisable AGEs such as phages, plasmids and the exponentially growing swathe of defence systems (DSs) within microbial genomes. Emerging evidence suggests that bacterial DSs can interact both synergistically and antagonistically with each other, and ecological studies describe non-random patterns of co-occurrence and avoidance of DSs in bacterial populations. Here, we analysed the distributions of DSs and AGEs in a recently curated dataset of 4,288 Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes. Genomic DS content varied by ecological niche, with higher numbers per genome in non-CF isolates (average n=6.9) compared to CF isolates (average n=7.9). We observed multiple phylogenetically independent associations (n=426) and dissociations (n=50) among DSs themselves, and between DSs and AGEs, many of which had a plausible biological basis. We further explored the relative importance of interactions among different AGEs and DS, which indicated that DSs and anti-defence systems have the most significant interactions with other AGEs and interact more strongly with each other than with other AGEs. Ultimately, these patterns of DS interactions and their variation across ecological niches sheds light on the evolutionary conflicts shaping bacterial accessory genomes and provides a significant public resource for downstream studies on DS and AGE interactions.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Here, using chromosome conformation capture methods (3C and 4C-seq), we report that DSB formation within the promoters of Fos and Npas4 is sufficient to emulate contact profiles observed at these regions following neuronal stimulation, including their elevated interactions with cognate enhancers. Furthermore, despite their purported risk, repeated DSB cycles within ERG promoters progressively potentiated ERG induction in both mouse cortical neurons and HEK293T cells, evoking the effects of transcriptional memory. Potentiated ERG inducibility following recurrent DSBs persisted through intervening cell cycles, occurred even when DNA repair was likely mutagenic, and was associated with a substantial loss of cis chromosome interactions and an increase in trans interactions with ERG promoters.

Elevated asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) levels is known to induce hypoxia driven mitochondrial dysfunction in the lungs, despite normoxic conditions. This alteration is known to be caused by interleukin-4 (IL-4). In addition to asthma, IL-4 and ADMA are also known to be elevated in metabolic syndrome (MetS), but the existence of hypoxic response in arterial tissue remains elusive. Since, MetS and asthma are correlated; we explored whether hypoxia exists in vascular tissue and is associated with IL-4 and ADMA levels. To induce MetS, C57BL/6 mice were fed chow, high-fat or high-fructose diets for six months. Interestingly, MetS was associated with the induction of the hypoxic response in aortic tissue. Further, IL-4 and ADMA, which induce aberrant hypoxic response despite normoxia in the lungs, were elevated in the aorta of mice with MetS. Additionally, significant reductions in the levels of mitochondrial biogenesis factors (TFAM, PGC1) and respiratory chain complexes (Complex I and Complex IV) were observed. Mitochondrial dysfunction in the aorta of mice with MetS perturbed mitochondrial inner membrane integrity and led to the leakage of cytochrome c in the cytosol. These results collectively suggest that elevated levels of IL-4 and ADMA in the aorta of mice with MetS correlates with induced vascular mitochondrial dysfunction and hypoxic response.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Yet, the mechanisms that support the virion-incorporation of Spike are incompletely defined. We noted an unusual feature of human sarbecovirus Spike proteins: their cytoplasmic domains (CDs) contain a stretch of acidic amino acids (DEDDSE). This sequence resembles a cluster of acidic residues, or acidic cluster (AC) motif, found in the cytoplasmic domain of the cellular endoprotease Furin. In Furin, the acidic cluster acts as a protein sorting signal, supporting its intracellular localization at the trans-Golgi network (TGN). We tested the contribution of the acidic cluster motif in the Spike CD to protein interactions and to the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We used virus-like particles (VLPs) as a model for viral infection (transduction). The SARS-CoV2 VLPs were produced by co-expressing Spike (S), Membrane (M), Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins and deliver an RNA encoding luciferase to target cells expressing the ACE2 receptor. Remarkably, when all five acidic residues of the DEDDSE sequence were replaced with alanines, the VLPs were rendered non-infectious. The N-terminal DE residues provided most of the activity of the acidic cluster. These virologically-impaired Spike mutants were able to reach the cell surface and induce the formation of syncytia, indicating that they are fusogenic and capable of anterograde traffic through the biosynthetic pathway to the plasma membrane. Despite this, they failed to efficiently incorporate into virions. We observed acidic cluster motif-dependent interactions of the Spike CD with several cellular proteins that could potentially support its role in virion-incorporation, including the ERM proteins Ezrin, Radixin, and Moesin; the retromer subunit Vps35, and the medium subunits of the clathrin adaptor complexes AP1 and AP2.

Traditional analytic approaches rely on analysis of thermal indices to describe thermal conditions organisms may or may not choose, though computational simulations could potentially be used to analyze thermoregulatory behavior explicitly. Here, we leverage a novel simulation framework that integrates data from operative thermal models deployed in microhabitats available to ectotherms to showcase the trade-offs be- tween two basic thermoregulatory strategies: maintaining a thermal optimum point or attempting to keep their body temperature within a preferred thermal range. We assess the output from simulations of these behavioral strategies to understand their influence on body temperature regulation and occupancy of thermal refugia, and then compare our findings from an empirical case study. Results from our analysis suggest that these two general strategies do not impact thermoregulation as strongly as previously assumed. We also found that occupancy of thermal refugia appeared to be driven by environmental conditions rather than the thermoregulation strategy. Although our case study showed promise in providing insights into predicting use of thermal refugia, understanding microhabitat occupancy from thermal data alone may require finer scale temporal data, or the integration of other factors such as foraging dynamics or predation avoidance.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Random effect model structures are often employed that treat individual effects as deviations from larger population-level effects. In this way individuals are assumed to be \"exchangeable\" samples. Ecologists may address this exchangeability assumption intuitively, but might in certain modeling contexts ignore it altogether, including in situations where it may have large implications for study design. Multispecies occupancy models based on detection/non-detection data are an approach that can be utilized by those tasked with monitoring rare and endangered species because most literature suggests that, compared to single species occupancy models, improved parameter estimates are assured. Yet, we illustrate through a power analysis how sampling requirements to detect experimental treatment effects vary tremendously depending on whether the species exchangeability assumption is met. The degree to which species in a community respond similarly to covariates governs the ability to accurately estimate parameters using multispecies occupancy models. Detecting small or moderate changes in occupancy resulting from habitat restoration treatments may be impossible for small datasets (e.g., < 36 sampling locations, each surveyed < 8 times) even with a paired treatment-control design if the exchangeability assumption is violated. By contrast, when the assumption is met, small effects may be confidently estimated with as few as 12 sampling locations (6 pairs) and 6-8 survey events. Often, it may be impossible to know whether the exchangeability assumption is met. The statistical power needed to accurately estimate species-specific effects using detection/non-detection multispecies occupancy models depends on the unknown values of treatment effects and whether responses by species in the community diverge. When the species exchangeability assumption is violated, and at lower levels of sampling effort, multispecies occupancy models may provide worse inference than single species occupancy models.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}
{"title": "Development of a Two-Stage Life Cycle Model to Inform the Trap and Haul Program for Coho Salmon in the Lewis River, Washington", "doi": "10.1101/2025.04.30.651546", "authors": "Perry, R. W.; Plumb, J. M.", "abstract": "Restoration of salmon populations in the upper Lewis River Basin depends on a trap-and-haul program owing to the Lewis River Hydroelectric Project (Project) operated by PacifiCorp and Cowlitz PUD (Utilities), which has been a barrier to salmon passage since the 1930s. Thus, sustaining the Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) population upstream of the Project currently depends on two fundamental factors: (1) the collection of upstream migrating adult Coho salmon at Merwin Dam, the lower most dam within the Project, and transporting them by truck to spawn above Swift Dam, the upper most dam within the Project; and (2) the collection of out-migrating juvenile Coho salmon at the downstream collection facility at Swift Dam for transport and release below the Project. The reintroduction program began once the downstream collection facility at Swift Dam was commissioned in late-2012 with the first year of transport data being collected in 2013. Over the past decade, the Utilities have been collecting data on juvenile outmigrants and adult fish returns at the dams. The need to construct a life cycle model for Lewis River anadromous fish was identified by the Lewis River Aquatic Technical Subgroup, with the understanding that many years (>15) of data collection are needed to adequately measure the life cycle production of coho salmon. Use of past data to construct models could help inform future data collection and provide a framework that can be updated annually to measure trap and haul program performance within a life cycle context (Note: Data are not currently available from PacifiCorp. Contact organization Chris Karchesky for further information). Because Coho salmon can live as long as five years, estimating demographic parameters for Coho salmon populations over their life cycle requires at least 10 or more years of data collection. Over the past decade, PacifiCorp has been collecting data on fish collection efficiency and the numbers of adult and juvenile salmon transported around the Lewis River dams, providing sufficient data to formulate a life cycle model that can guide future data collection efforts and provide preliminary information to resource managers The goal of the statistical life cycle model was to estimate annual production and survival during two critical life-stage transitions (1) the freshwater production from escapement of adults released upstream of Swift Dam, and the collection of downstream migrating juveniles at the passage facility at Swift Dam, and (2) the smolt-to-adult survival from the time of collection at Swift Dam to their return as adults. We used the Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment model to estimate juvenile production from the number of spawners. This approach allowed us to test for density dependence at current spawner abundances while estimating annual productivity, defined as the number of juveniles produced per spawner at low spawner abundance. Productivity was then expressed as a function of the number of juveniles collected and transported downstream of the Project. Because juvenile Fish Collection Efficiency (FCE) directly affects the number of juveniles that survive to continue downstream migration, FCE is a primary determinant of fish production. Consequently, the modeling framework is well suited to evaluate the performance of trap and haul programs within a life cycle context. The objectives of this study were to: (1) gather and collate available data on adult and juvenile Coho salmon at Merwin and Swift dams, (2) quantify adult escapement, juvenile abundance, and the age at outmigration and adult return, (3) describe, formulate, and fit the integrated population model (IPM) to the data, and (4) summarize our findings, identify data gaps, and identify potential opportunities for future studies that could provide information used to improve model estimation and inference. Our key findings were: (1) over and above the number of spawning females, FCE was the primary factor affecting productivity of Coho salmon above Swift Dam, (2) smolt-to-adult return (SAR) rates were relatively high considering that harvest was included in the estimate, averaging about 4.5% and ranging as high as 12.9%, and (3) juvenile capacity upriver of Swift Dam was difficult to estimate due to the limited range in spawning females over the time series of data, suggesting the model may be improved by collecting data at higher spawner abundances. In addition, by including FCE in the model, we estimated that the median pre-collection productivity, defined as the number of juveniles produced per spawner when FCE = 1, was 64 juveniles per spawner. Because this two-stage life cycle model partitions factors that affect fish production in river versus the ocean, the model estimates should help inform fishery managers about the overall role that fish collection at Swift Dam plays in the recovery and sustainability of Lewis River Coho salmon. By providing the model with (1) more years of data, (2) higher numbers of spawning females, and (3) data on age at juvenile migration in relation to age at adult return greater certainty in the estimates of capacity and SAR can be attained. Ultimately, information provided by the model can assist in the evaluation and continued improvement of the current trap and haul program to support anadromous fishes in the Lewis River Basin.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

In this study, we present two cryo-EM structures of the transcription activation complex (Mor-TAC and C-TAC) with phage Mu middle and late gene promoters, respectively. Remarkably, the Mor/C activators bind to promoter DNA as a centrosymmetric tetramer rather than as the proposed dimer, concurrently stabilizing by the N-terminal dimerization domains and C-termini. The C-terminal DNA binding domains and two anti-{beta}-strands simultaneously interact with two adjacent DNA major grooves. The activators also engage a variety of interactions with the conserved domains (CTD, {sigma}70R4, and {beta} FTH) of RNAP, providing evidences for a recruitment mechanism. In addition, single-molecule FRET assays show that C significantly enhances RPitc formation, suggesting a different multi-step activation mechanism for C.

Digital light projection stereolithography was used to design and fabricate a three-chambered PDMS microfluidic chip. Model osteocytes (murine MLO-Y4) were encapsulated in collagen matrix within the chip to form self-assembled three-dimensional (3D) cell networks. Daily stimulus in the form of PUFFS was then applied for upto 21 days. A combination of experiments, computational simulation and analytical modeling was used to characterize the mechanical environment experienced by embedded cells during PUFFS. Viability, morphology, cell-connectivity, expression of key proteins, and gene expression, and real-time calcium signaling within 3D osteocyte networks were characterized at select time-points and compared to static conditions. Results show that PUFFS stimulation at 0.33 and 1.66 Hz can initiate mechanotransduction via calcium signals that are propagated across the network of collagen encapsulated osteocytes via Cx43 junctions. Furthermore, osteocytes cultured in these devices maintain expression of several key osteocyte genes for up to 21d.

After more than fifty generations of late selection, progeny displayed diminished resistance to acute oxidative stress, disrupted partitioning of stored lipids, reduced movement capacity, and an overall shortening of lifespan. In contrast, starvation resistance was improved and late selection had negligible effects on developmental timing and total reproductive output that suggests a reduction in lifespan health to preserve reproductive capacity. The phenotypes of late selection are reminiscent of animals with activation of the cytoprotective transcription factor SKN-1 but are unlikely a result of a spontaneous genetic mutation.

To overcome this bottleneck, we have expanded the available regulatory repertoire in T. thermophilus by developing novel artificial 5' regulatory sequences. In this study, we applied our Gene Expression Engineering platform to engineer 53 artificial 5' regulatory sequences (ARES) in T. thermophilus. These ARES, which comprise both promoter and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs), were functionally characterised in both T. thermophilus and Escherichia coli, revealing distinct host-specific expression patterns. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of these ARES by demonstrating high-level expression of thermostable proteins, including {beta} -galactosidase, a superfolder citrine fluorescent protein, and phytoene synthase. A bioinformatic analysis of the novel sequences has also being carried out indicating that the ARES possess markedly lower GC content compared to native promoters.

This study investigates whether these tails influence body stability during gliding, when the pectoral fins remain extended and held in position. We first measured relative tail lengths across the four families (Rhinopteridae, Myliobatidae, Aetobatidae, and Mobulidae). Using two 3D-printed models based on a myliobatid body and a NACA 0012 shape, we tested the effects of different tail lengths (double, equal to disc width, and no tail) on posture and stability across increasing flow speeds (1 to 4.5 body lengths/second) in a recirculating flow tank. Pitch, roll, and ODBA were recorded via an embedded accelerometer. Our results show that tail length varies among myliobatids, with spotted eagle rays having the longest tails (up to 4 times body length) and giant manta rays the shortest (0.9 times body length). Models without tails exhibited greater instability, particularly increased roll and ODBA. However, tails longer than body length did not provide additional stability or affect pitch. Although tails offered similar results in both models, the tailless NACA model was more unstable at high speeds than the manta body model. We propose that elongate tails of myliobatids enhance stability by generating hydrodynamic drag and exerting a restoring moment around the center of gravity, thereby damping body oscillations. Tails exceeding 0.9 times body length may serve additional functions such as communication, mating, or sensory roles.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

We thus developed a CRISPR/Cas9-based approach to engineer dual CNI [cyclosporine (CsA) and voclosporin (VCS)] resistant IEC therapies by targeting PPIA (encoding cyclophilin A - CypA), a critical binding partner for both drugs. Because CypA has several homeostatic functions in T cells, a complete CypA knock-out could impair cell viability. To avoid this, we CRISPR edited the last exon of the PPIA gene, corresponding to the C-terminus of CypA, selectively disrupting amino acids that mediate CsA/VCS-based inhibition, while leaving the majority of CypA intact. Unlike an edit in an upstream exon, which was detrimental to cell survival and rapidly selected out, C-terminal editing was stable throughout expansion and preserved CypA protein expression.

It possesses the potential to generate novel virulence races through sexual reproduction, which is the primary cause of its extensive epidemics. Mating type (MAT) of Pst lacks direct experimental evidence to account for the role of sexual recombination on high genetic diversity in evolution. Herein, we developed 11 pairs of HD alleles of Pst MAT genes, and 2 pairs HD alleles of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei (Psh, the causal agent of barley stripe rust) MAT genes. HD alleles in Pst are different from those in Psh. We tested that mating system of Pst is tetrapolar responsible for sexual genetic recombination via HD genes by experiments of selfing and sexual hybridization on alternate (secondary) hosts. Multiple HD gene types and HD gene recombination types were detected in Chinese natural Pst populations of 200 Pst isolates and 13 Psh isolates from 92 sampling sites in 11 provinces, supporting that sexual reproduction accounts for frequent emergence of new races and high genetic diversity of Pst population in northwestern oversummering variable region (hotspot) than other stripe rust-occurring regions in China. Overall, these results provide an insight into diverse types and frequent exchange of Ps MAT alleles, revealing the important role of sexual recombination via MAT alleles in virulence variation, high genetic diversity and epidemics of Pst, and also provide a basis for wheat stripe rust control in those regions where sexual reproduction occurs.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

P.; Dobbins, A. L.; Erhardt, M.; Hendrixson, D. R.; Zhulin, I.", "abstract": "The bacterial flagellum is a complex nanomachine essential for motility, environmental sensing, and host colonization. While many of its core components have been well characterized, the relevance of proteins such as FliO, which are inconsistently annotated and poorly conserved at the sequence level, has remained ambiguous in their evolutionary and functional status. Here, we present a comprehensive phylogenomic and structural analysis of FliO across >30,000 representative genomes spanning >100 bacterial phyla. Additionally, during this analysis, we found that approximately 40% of bacterial genomes contain flagellar genes - significantly fewer than previously reported. Using a custom pipeline combining low-threshold HMM searches, operon context analysis, and structural information, we demonstrate that FliO is present in ~95% of genomes encoding the core flagellar components FliP, FliQ, and FliR. This suggests that FliO is a nearly ubiquitous and ancestral core component of the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS). FliO exhibits considerable structural diversity, including lineage-specific acquisitions of LysM and AMIN domains. We identify FliO homologs not only in canonical flagellar systems but also in some virulence-associated T3SS and even some non-flagellated organisms, suggesting functional repurposing and highlighting its functional plasticity. Functional studies in Campylobacter jejuni reveal that FliO and its AMIN domain are critical for efficient bipolar flagellation, membrane stability of the export gate component FlhB, and colonization of the host. These findings establish FliO as a core, yet evolutionarily dynamic, component of flagella and provide new insights into the evolution and diversification of bacterial secretion systems.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Expanding its genetic toolbox is essential to facilitate efficient genetic manipulation, including successive transformations and multiple or reusable selection markers for consecutive gene deletions. We applied CRISPR/Cas9 via ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes for gene editing in T. atroviride and successfully deleted three target genes, i.e., pks4 (involved in spore pigment production), pyr4 (pyrimidine biosynthesis), and pex5 (receptor for peroxisomal matrix protein import). Although double-strand breaks induced by Cas9 can be repaired via homology-directed repair (HDR), using donor templates, the most effective gene deletions in our case were achieved via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), by co-transforming a transiently stable telomere vector carrying the hygromycin-resistance gene (hph), which was rapidly lost under non-selective conditions. This strategy promoted NHEJ repair and resulted in the efficient deletion of open reading frames between two Cas9 target sites. Our results demonstrate that combining CRISPR/Cas9 RNP delivery with transient telomere vectors provides a fast and reliable method for marker-free gene deletion and vector recycling in T. atroviride, advancing the reverse genetic toolkit available for this important biocontrol fungus.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Thus, the benefit of producing these proteins during stress conditions is unknown. In the current study we used a multidisciplinary approach to determine the function of the 27 amino acid long protein YohP in E. coli. Our proteomics approach revealed that YohP production leads to an up-regulation of proteins involved in membrane protection and to a down-regulation of many enzymes involved in key metabolic processes, such as nucleotide biosynthesis. Further biochemical characterizations revealed increased cardiolipin content in the membrane, a partial dissipation of the membrane potential and reduced membrane fluidity in YohP-containing membranes. Finally, our data show that YohP production induces the stringent response and leads to elevated levels of (p)ppGpp. Overall, our data indicate that the YohP-induced proteome and membrane changes initiate a state of metabolic silencing that protects E. coli against stress and helps to conserve cellular resources.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

The intrinsic population growth rate of the G4-like phage isolates was measured on the four host clones at three temperatures, reflective of a low, optimum and high temperature for one of the phage. The phage's intrinsic growth rate was significantly affected by host-temperature and phage-temperature interactions, but not by the interaction between host and phage. Across temperatures, phage growth rate was consistently highest on the host clone with the highest maximum growth rate, but was not, contrary to our expectations, lowest on the host with the lowest growth rate.

They enable in vitro studies of brain development and disease mechanisms, providing disease models for various neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental / degenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, microcephaly, and autism. There are many protocols to generate NOs with different complexities and sizes, varying from 400 microns to several mm in diameter, with a starvation-induced necrotic core eventually forming depending on the diameter and culture conditions. Thus, they can benefit from vascularization and more optimal culture conditions. There have been several attempts to decrease necrosis while growing larger NOs, such as by using orbital shaking or 2D/3D microfluidic chips, but only with limited success. In this study, we describe a 3D finite element model to simulate O2 starvation-induced necrosis in NOs using the Damkohler Number (Da) and the Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We measured the necrotic areas in NOs using fluorescent imaging and used them to calibrate the model with a specific Da. Using these calibrated values, we systematically compared simulations of different NO culture methods: static, orbital shaking, and microfluidic flow around organoids--highlighting their relative impacts on nutrient diffusion and necrosis. We observed that these culture strategies cannot prevent necrosis beyond a diameter of ~800 microns. Based on these findings, we propose that 3D spatial perfusion, achieved through uniformly distributed fluidic capillaries within the NO, could significantly reduce necrosis. We conducted parametric studies on capillary spacing, density, and layout. Our calibrated model offers insights for designing next-generation microfabricated bioreactors and culture devices, not just for NOs but also for all 3D tissue engineering and organoid research.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Carbon storage regulator A (CsrA), a highly conserved small RNA-binding protein, serves as a critical post-transcriptional regulator by recognizing GGA motifs in target transcripts and typically repressing translation. Despite extensive research, how this conserved regulator has evolved diverse species-specific regulatory networks remains unclear. Here, using Bacillus subtilis as an experimental chassis, we have developed Swarm-seq - a high-throughput functional genomics platform capable of assessing CsrA homologs across the Bacterial domain for their ability to regulate flagella-dependent swarming motility. Systematically testing over five-hundred codon-optimized csrA homologs for flagellin (Hag) repression revealed striking functional divergence, i.e., broadly two classes of CsrAs. Class I, exemplified by CsrAHp from Helicobacter pylori and RsmN from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strongly inhibited swarming, while Class II, exemplified by CsrAEc from Escherichia coli and RsmA from P. aeruginosa failed despite high sequence conservation. This differential activity occurred despite all proteins targeting identical GGA motifs in the hag transcript's 5'UTR, indicating evolutionary plasticity in RNA-binding specificity beyond motif recognition. We propose that this plasticity enables a conserved global regulator to develop species-specific regulons through subtle structural adaptations, facilitating diverse physiological responses across bacterial taxa. Our findings establish B. subtilis as a powerful platform for characterizing CsrA homologs from genetically intractable bacteria, providing insights into post-transcriptional regulatory network evolution.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

We observed high expression of Chi3l1 in both KCs and MoMFs during MASLD development. Genetic deletion of Chi3l1 specifically in KCs significantly exacerbated MASLD severity and metabolic dysfunction, whereas MoMF-specific Chi3l1 deletion showed minimal metabolic effects. Mechanistic studies revealed that this cell type-specific regulation arises from differential metabolic requirements: KCs display elevated glucose metabolism compared to MoMFs. Chi3l1 directly interacts with glucose to inhibit its cellular uptake, thereby selectively protecting glucose-dependent KCs from metabolic stress-induced cell death while having negligible effects on less glucose-dependent MoMFs. These findings uncover a novel Chi3l1-mediated metabolic checkpoint that preferentially maintains KCs populations through glucose metabolism modulation, providing important new insights into the pathogenesis of MASLD and potential therapeutic strategies targeting macrophage-specific metabolic pathways.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

Recent studies have shown deregulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-induced unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways in skeletal muscles in various catabolic conditions, including cancer growth. However, the role of individual arms of the UPR in regulation of muscle mass remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the IRE1/XBP1 arm of the UPR stimulates the activation of ubiquitin-proteasome system, autophagy, JAK-STAT3 signaling, and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle of the KPC mouse model of pancreatic cancer cachexia. Furthermore, our results show that IRE1/XBP1 pathway is a key contributor to cachexia as targeted ablation of XBP1 transcription factor in mouse skeletal muscle inhibits KPC tumor-induced muscle wasting. Transcriptionally active XBP1 protein binds to the promoter region of multiple genes whose products are involved in skeletal muscle wasting. Treatment of KPC tumor-bearing mice with 48C, a small molecule IRE1 inhibitor, reverses cachexia-induced molecular changes and improves skeletal muscle mass and strength.

We evolved the anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris to use formate as the sole carbon source. Through gene deletions, we determined that formate is assimilated via oxidation to CO2 by formate dehydrogenase followed by CO2 fixation by the Calvin cycle. However, this pathway had no clear link to three genes that were commonly mutated in evolved isolates: (i) ribB, a flavin synthesis enzyme, (ii) ppsR2, a repressor of light-harvesting genes, and (iii) RPA0893, a regulator of unknown function. A RibB mutation was necessary and sufficient for formate assimilation and improved formate oxidation. PpsR2 mutations occurred early, facilitated formate assimilation, and caused elevated pigmentation. Pigment production generates CO2 and alkaline conditions that, along with intracellular chromatophore membranes, could represent a rudimentary but important CO2-concentrating mechanism. RPA0983 mutations emerged late and facilitated formate assimilation. RPA0983 proximity to a CO2-liberating pigment synthesis gene suggests a similar effect as PpsR2 mutations.

The vascular endothelium is critical for T. pallidum attachment, dissemination, and host immune response initiation; however, the molecular details of T. pallidum-endothelial interactions are incompletely understood. To enhance understanding, we performed time-course transcriptomic profiling on T. pallidum-exposed brain microvascular endothelial cells. These analyses showed T. pallidum exposure altered pathways related to extracellular matrix, growth factors, integrins, and Rho GTPases. The induced transcriptional response was consistent with endothelial to mesenchymal transition, a process involved in fetal development and vascular dysfunction. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular responses of endothelial cells to T. pallidum and identified the host pathways that might cause syphilis disease symptoms, information that could aid in syphilis vaccine design.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}

T.", "abstract": "Methylated CpG loci mutate at high rates, but it remains challenging to identify sample-specific non-reference CpG loci for methylation analyses. Here, we present a likelihood-based method that identifies sample-specific CpG loci at high precision in long-read sequencing data from Nanopore and PacBio platforms. Inclusion of non-reference CpG loci increased the number of loci and reduced reference bias, and is important for accurate estimation of global methylation levels across samples.", "date": "2025-05-06", "journal": ""}
