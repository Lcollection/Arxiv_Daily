M.", "abstract": "Extremely preterm birth (at < 28 postconceptional weeks) leads to brain injury and represents the leading cause of childhood-onset neuropsychiatric diseases. No effective therapeutics exist to reduce the incidence and severity of brain injury of prematurity. Hypoxic events are the most important environmental factor, along with inflammation. Among other developmental processes, the second half of in utero fetal development coincides with the migration of cortical interneurons from the ganglionic eminences into the cortex; this process is thus prone to disruptions following extremely preterm birth. To date, no studies have directly investigated the migration of human cortical inhibitory neurons under hypoxic conditions. Using multi-day confocal live imaging in human forebrain assembloids (hFA) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and ex vivo developing human brain tissue, we found a substantial reduction in the migration of hypoxic interneurons. Using transcriptomics, we identified adrenomedullin (ADM) as the gene with the highest fold change increase in expression. Based on previous literature about the protective role of supplemental ADM for other injuries, here, we demonstrated that addition of exogenous ADM to the hypoxic media restores the migration defects of interneurons. Lastly, we showed that one of the mechanisms of protection by ADM is through the activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway and subsequent pCREB-dependent rescued expression of a subset of GABA receptors, which are known to promote migration. Overall, in this manuscript we provide the first direct evidence for hypoxia-induced deficits in the migration of human cortical interneurons and identify ADM as a possible target for therapeutic development.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

As a possible co-evolutionary response to attack by specialists, plants in the genus Erysimum gained the ability to produce novel cardenolide defences in addition to ancestral glucosinolates. We grew the dually defended E. cheiranthoides side-by-side with the phenologically similar Rhamnospermum nigrum (syn. Brassica nigra) in agricultural fields surrounded by other Brassicaceae crops. Over the course of two field seasons, we monitored focal plants to characterise their associated herbivore community, and we quantified herbivore damage and measured plant growth. In the second year, we additionally manipulated herbivore density and plant competition to identify direct and indirect effects on plant fitness. Both plant species were attacked by a diverse community of specialist herbivores already present on the surrounding Brassicaceae crops. Most herbivores strongly favoured R. nigrum, reaching higher densities and causing intense damage that largely suppressed growth of these plants. A similar community of herbivores attacked E. cheiranthoides, but at much lower densities that caused little damage and did not impact plant growth. in accordance with differential susceptibilities to herbivores, herbivore removal benefitted R. nigrum by reducing damage and increasing plant growth, while it had no positive effect on E. cheiranthoides. In fact, herbivore removal had an indirect negative effect on E. cheiranthoides plants growing in conspecific pairs, as they suffered from increased competition by otherwise herbivore-suppressed R. nigrum. Our results agree with a successful escape of E. cheiranthoides from herbivory, as even though plants are still attacked when herbivores are abundant, these herbivores cause little damage and cause no reduction in fitness. However, the escape from herbivory has likely come at loss of competitive ability when herbivore pressure is low, which would explain why despite its key innovation, E. cheiranthoides has been unable to gain dominance in any plant community.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Arrhythmic pathology is often rooted in the cardiac conduction system, but the mechanism is complex and not fully understood. For example, how metabolic diseases, like obesity and diabetes, increase the risk for cardiac arrhythmia. Glucagon regulates glucose production, mobilizes lipids from the fat body, and affects cardiac rate and rhythm, attributes of a likely key player. Drosophila is an established model to study metabolic diseases and cardiac arrhythmias. Since glucagon signaling is highly conserved, we used high-fat diet (HFD)-fed flies to study its effect on heart function. HFD led to increased heartbeat and an irregular rhythm. The HFD-fed flies showed increased levels of adipokinetic hormone (Akh), the functional equivalent to human glucagon. Both genetic reduction of Akh and eliminating the Akh producing cells (APC) rescued HFD-induced arrhythmia, whereas heart rhythm was normal in Akh receptor mutants (AkhRnull). Furthermore, we discovered a pair of cardiac neurons that express high levels of Akh receptor. These are located near the posterior heart, make synaptic connections at the heart muscle, and regulate heart rhythm. Altogether, this Akh signaling pathway provides new understanding of the regulatory mechanisms between metabolic disease and cardiac arrhythmia.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we report the role of lamins and Top2 during transition from normal conditions (N), in heat shock (HS) and recovery (R) in Drosophila since the fly genome contains a single gene for B-type lamin (lamin Dm), for A-type lamin (lamin C) and Top2. Heat shock increases transient phosphorylation of lamin Dm on S25, induces changes in solubility of lamin Dm, Top2, HSF, HDAC1 and HP1 proteins, especially in S2 cells and relocates Top2 and chromatin closer to the nuclear lamina with induction of granular staining for Top2 in Kc, S2 and embryonic cells. Lamin Dm interacts with Top2 protein and HS increases the interaction. In vivo photocrosslinking and immunoprecipitation revealed a significant increase in binding to chromatin and nucleic acids upon HS induction for Top2 and lamin Dm. All the detected changes in the properties and location of proteins returned to \"normal\" after recovery from heat shock. This suggests an important role for lamin Dm, Top2 and their complexes in nuclear functions during HS and recovery. We propose a model in which relocation of Top2 chromatin complexes closer to the nuclear lamina and lamin Dm may help to rearrange the gene expression pattern by tethering HS inactivated genes to nuclear lamina and NPCs which might also help to bind nuclear fraction of non-HSrelated transcripts at the nuclear lamina/NPCs area.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify the C-type lectin receptor CD301b (encoded by Mgl2) as a regulator of immune activity within the breast tumor microenvironment (TME). Using a murine triple-negative breast cancer model, we demonstrate that tumors expressing the Tn glycoantigen grow more rapidly, and this growth is facilitated by CD301b+ immune cells. Depletion or genetic loss of CD301b markedly suppressed tumor growth, indicating that CD301b promotes tumor progression through myeloid-tumor interactions. Phenotypic analyses revealed that CD301b+ cells within tumors are type 2 conventional dendritic cells (cDC2s), a subset known to influence immune polarization. Single-cell RNA sequencing of human breast cancers showed that the human ortholog CLEC10A is expressed in cDC2-like dendritic cells and select macrophage subsets, suggesting a conserved role for CD301+ myeloid populations. Transcriptomic profiling of tumors developed in Mgl2-deficient mice revealed a shift toward an inflammatory, immune-activated state consistent with enhanced antitumor immunity. Together, these findings establish a link between tumor glycosylation and lectin signaling of myeloid cells, highlighting CD301b as a potential target for reprogramming the tumor immune microenvironment in breast cancer.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Podocyte specific IR/IGF1R knockdown mice developed a severe kidney phenotype with albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis and renal failure with death occurring in some mice between 4 and 24 weeks. Simultaneous knockdown of both receptors in cultured podocytes resulted in >50% cell death by 7 days.

Here we perform constant pH simulations and graph-based analyses to investigate dynamics and H-bond patterns of the neuropeptide Y in the pH range from 3.0 to 7.0. We find that an -helical core, as observed in the NMR experiments, is presented at all pH values, though its length can vary by 2-3 residues depending on the pH. The pKa of Asp16, part of the -helix, and of Asp11 may shift by more than on pH unit.

While the pathogen exploits host nutrients to support its growth and virulence, the plant attempts to restrict pathogen multiplication by limiting nutrient availability or producing antimicrobial compounds. To unravel these trophic interactions, we constructed a genome-scale metabolic model of a complete pathosystem by integrating a multi-organ metabolic model of the plant, a pathogen metabolic model, quantitative measurements, and a mathematical framework based on sequential flux balance analyses (FBAs). This strategy was applied to the Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum-tomato system. For the first time, quantitative fluxes of matter occurring during a plant infection were predicted. The model shows that (i) plant photosynthetic capacity is a stronger constraint than mineral availability for bacterial proliferation, (ii) infection-induced reduction of plant transpiration limits and ultimately halts first plant growth, then pathogen expansion, (iii) stem resource hijacking can enhance bacterial growth but remains secondary, and (iv) pathogen-excreted putrescine is likely reused for the plant's needs.

Two fatty acids are found in each protomer of the HKU5 S protein, which stabilize the S protein in the closed conformation.

Environmental stress sensed by a cell starts a complex chain of reactions between MAPK enzymes that ultimately activates the master stress response regulator protein p38 MAPK. Thus activated, p38 must then selectively activate targets from a pool of hundreds to initiate appropriate cellular responses. Mechanisms for how p38 performs this selection remain unclear. Here we show that human p38 target selectivity is based on the same principles as modern electronic telecommunications systems, except using waves of chemicals rather than electromagnetic fields or electric currents. p38 encodes information about stimuli as different frequency oscillations of its activation state, and targets are selected through frequency-dependent resonance of oscillating biochemical reactions between p38 and its targets. We demonstrate this mechanism by activating various genetic responses in human cells by applying only sugar at different frequencies. These results unify observations of oscillating signaling components and altered responses into a coherent framework to understand and control human gene expression. As failures of this mechanism may contribute to some p38-associated diseases, these findings may have implications for pharmaceutical development and therapeutic strategies.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

I.; Visser, M.; Zareba, M.

Although often co-occurring with other psychological and neurodevelopmental conditions such as anxiety, depression and autism spectrum disorders, alexithymia is believed to be associated with unique alterations within the socio-emotional brain networks. With the semantic and neuromodulatory brainstem systems playing a key role in social and affective cognition, the current work aimed to study their contributions to alexithymia in unprecedented detail. First, we attempted to identify resting-state functional connectivity patterns of the social semantic hubs (superior anterior temporal lobe) and monoamine-producing regions (dorsal raphe, ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus) linked to each alexithymia domain. Secondly, by deploying tractography and graph analysis of the associated structural network, we intended to identify their potential anatomical correlates. Alexithymia was strongly associated with dysconnectivity within the semantic network, and altered functional connectivity between the neuromodulatory brainstem regions and cortical areas crucial for social cognition and emotion regulation, including medial prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule. On the anatomical level, these findings were paralleled by negative links with network modularity, suggestive of less specialised neural processing, and decreased clustering coefficient of the semantic node in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus. Despite observing associations with trait-anxiety and emotion suppression for some of the highlighted findings, these phenomena did not mediate the effects of alexithymia. Therefore, the current work highlights the existence of functional and structural alterations within socio-emotional networks as neural markers of alexithymia.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

We confirm the location and identity of known wing mechanosensory neurons and identify previously uncharacterized axons, including a novel population of putative proprioceptors that make monosynaptic connections onto wing steering motor neurons. We also find that proprioceptors of adjacent campaniform sensilla on the wing have distinct axon morphologies and postsynaptic partners, suggesting a high degree of specialization in axon pathfinding and synaptic partner matching.

Current human pluripotent stem cell differentiation protocols fail to selectively generate these subtypes. Here we describe a multiomic-guided strategy that enriches SOX6+ mDA neurons by combining enhancing Sonic Hedgehog agonism with prolonged Wnt activation. This approach accelerates floor plate specification, increases expression of mDA developmental markers, and increases substantially the yield of SOX6 mature mDA neurons compared to prior attempts. Following intrastriatal transplantation into hemiparkinsonian mice, these cells restore motor function in approximately 4 months and generated grafts containing SOX6 A9-like neurons.

Here, we investigated TBRS etiology using new human pluripotent stem cell models, modeling varying levels of TBRS-associated loss of DNMT3A function. We identified lineage-specific overgrowth in TBRS ventral forebrain medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-like progenitors, due in part to increased signaling through the PIK3/AKT/mTOR pathway that could be modulated to ameliorate this phenotype. By contrast, reduced DNA methylation during MGE-like progenitor differentiation into GABAergic interneurons caused premature expression of neuronal and synaptic genes, triggering precocious neuronal maturation. As a result, TBRS GABAergic neurons exhibited hyperactivity sufficient to alter the development and structure of neuronal networks, likely contributing to the intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder common to TBRS patients. Together, this work elucidates new roles for DNMT3A-mediated gene repression in human cortical development, identifying critical requirements for regulating GABAergic neuron production and neuronal network function. These findings also provide evidence for interrelated pathogenic mechanisms underlying TBRS and other OGIDs, including PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndrome and Weaver Syndrome, providing a foundation and rationale for future studies to identify common paradigms to treat these related disorders.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Despite the promise of machine learning, traditional methods often fall short in providing both high classification accuracy and interpretable, statistically validated feature importance scores for high-dimensional imaging data. This gap is particularly evident when conventional techniques such as random forests, LIME, and SHAP are applied, as they struggle with complex feature interactions and managing noise in large datasets. We address this challenge by developing an integrated framework that combines Oblique Random Forests (ORFs) with a novel, permutation-based feature importance testing algorithm. ORFs extend traditional random forests by employing oblique decision boundaries through linear combinations of features, thereby capturing intricate interactions inherent in neuroimaging data. Our feature importance testing method, NEOFIT, rigorously quantifies the significance of each feature by generating null distributions and corrected p-values. We first validate our approach using simulated datasets, establishing its robustness and scalability under controlled conditions. We then apply our method to classify sex from both voxel-wise structural MRI and cortical thickness data in humans and macaques, facilitating direct cross-species comparisons. ORFs achieves AUC >0.80 on human data, and >0.70 on macaque data, while NEOFIT identifies statistically significant features aligned with sex-dimorphic neuroanatomy. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework not only enhances classification performance but also provides clear, interpretable insights into the neuroanatomical features that distinguish sexes.

In the IncHI1 R27 plasmid-encoded pilus, the TrhA pilin undergoes cyclisation (via a peptide bond between Gly1 and Asp69), essential for conjugation. Gly1 and Asp69 are exposed on the pilus surface and conserved in all TrhA pilins in the Plascad database. Substituting Asp69 with Asn, Ala, Gly, or Arg did not prevent cyclisation or pilus formation, which remained structurally indistinguishable from the wild type. Conjugation efficiency of the Asp69 substitutions across multiple recipient species correlated with side chain size, in the order Asp69Asn > Asp69Ala > Asp69Gly. However, Asp69Arg, as well as Asp69Lys and Gly1Lys substitutions abolished conjugation, likely due to the positively charged pilus surface (opposite to the wild-type negative charge) forming unfavourable electrostatic interactions with the recipient outer membrane's inner leaflet, composed solely of zwitterionic phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Consistently, conjugation was rescued in recipients lacking PE.

However, the molecular mechanisms linking inflammation to these hematopoietic alterations remain poorly understood. Here, we uncover a pivotal role of transposable element (TE) derepression, specifically of the most recent LINE-1 (L1) elements, in mediating inflammation-induced HSC dysfunction. We show that chronic exposure to low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes a loss of the heterochromatin mark H3K9me3 at L1s in wild-type (WT) HSCs, leading to L1 activation, DNA damage, and reduced clonogenic capacity. Remarkably, Tet2-/- HSCs are resistant to this LPS-induced L1 derepression and associated genomic instability. Furthermore, targeted degradation of L1 RNAs in WT HSCs diminishes the competitive advantage of Tet2-/- HSCs under chronic inflammatory conditions both in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal epigenetic control of L1 elements as a previously unrecognized mechanism that links chronic inflammation to HSC impairment and clonal expansion of Tet2-mutant cells.

Deciphering the mechanisms that explain species distributions has been a long-term goal in ecology and is critical to predicting the responses of ecological communities to environmental change. To this end, Joint Species Distribution Models (JSDMs) assess the effects of abiotic factors on these communities and produce species association networks that describe statistical dependencies between species abundances. Species distribution data often contain numerous zeros. Not accounting for structural zeros (as opposed to zeros owing to species rarity or abiotic effects, modelled by JSDMs) can impair inferences of species association networks. 2. We propose a novel JSDM, the ZIPLN-network model, which directly models count data while including zero-inflation, thereby allowing it to account for structural zeros. Using simulated data, we compare the results obtained by this model to existing JSDMs in terms of association network inference from abundance data containing structural zeros. We illustrate the ZIPLN-network approach using data from tropical freshwater fish communities. 3. By integrating zero-inflation, our approach overcomes a previous shortcoming in analyses of species distribution data, and makes it possible to extract more of the ecological signal. A further advantage of this method is that it increases our understanding of ecological mechanisms that structure species distributions at the landscape scale ; this helps generate testable hypotheses. When the ZIPLN-network results are compared with those of its non-zero-inflated counterpart, a finer analysis of a species distribution dataset results. 4. The ZIPLN-network approach can be widely applied to species distribution datasets to produce more informed analyses and help distinguish different mechanisms so as to better understand community assembly rules.

L.; Hendricks, A. G.", "abstract": "Tau, a neuronal microtubule-associated protein (MAP), organizes the axonal cytoskeleton and regulates intracellular transport. Tau hyperphosphorylation is linked to neurodegeneration in tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. Tau binds microtubules cooperatively to form cohesive tau envelopes, which are thought to control access to the microtubule lattice and regulate the activity of motor proteins and other microtubule-associated proteins. However, how disease-related perturbations affect tau dynamics and its function as a selective barrier to intracellular transport remains unclear. Using tau phosphomutants in vitro and in live neurons, we show that tau hyperphosphorylation disrupts cooperative binding and dysregulates lysosome transport. Hyperphosphorylated tau does not form envelopes, distributes more uniformly along the axon, and dissociates faster from microtubules. Tau weakly inhibits KIF5C motility, but strongly inhibits KIF1A. Hyperphosphorylation reduces KIF5C inhibition but increases KIF1A inhibition by decreasing processivity and accelerating detachment. Consistent with these effects, hyperphosphorylated tau alters lysosome transport in neurons. While phospho-resistant tau inhibits processive lysosome motility, hyperphosphorylated tau weakens tau-mediated regulation of lysosome transport-mimicking tau knockout neurons that exhibit enhanced processivity. Altogether, these findings show that hyperphosphorylation disrupts tau envelopes and impairs lysosome trafficking, likely contributing to early defects in degradative pathways that drive neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

GLP-1-based drugs have massively transformed care, but long-term consequences are unclear in part due to reductions in energy expenditure with ongoing use. Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) and cold exposure (CE) raise EE via brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation and beiging of white adipose tissue (WAT). Methionine restriction (MetR) is a candidate DIT stimulus, but its EE effect has not been benchmarked against CE, nor have their tissue-level interactions been defined. Objective & Methods: In a 2*2 design (Control vs. MetR; room temperature, RT: 22 C vs. CE: 4 C for 24 h), we used male C57BL/6N mice to benchmark MetR-induced thermogenesis against CE and mapped how diet and temperature interact across tissues. Bulk RNA-seq profiled liver, iBAT, iWAT, and eWAT. Differential expression was modeled with main effects and a diet:temperature interaction. KEGG GSEA was used to assess pathway-level enrichment. Results: MetR increased EE at RT and shifted fuel use towards lipid oxidation, supporting MetR as a bona fide DIT stimulus. CE elevated EE across diets and blunted diet differences. Transcriptomic responses were tissue-specific: in liver, CE dominated gene induction while MetR and CE cooperatively repressed genes. The combination enriched glucagon/AMPK-linked and core metabolic pathways. In iBAT, CE dominated thermogenic and lipid-oxidation programs with minimal MetR contribution. In iWAT, MetR and CE acted largely additively with high concordance, enhancing fatty-acid degradation, PPAR signaling, thermogenesis, and TCA cycle pathways. In eWAT, robust co-dependent and synergistic differential expression emerged only with MetR+CE. Conclusion: MetR is a genuine DIT stimulus that remodels metabolism in a tissue-specific manner.

Here, we applied multiscale molecular simulations and sequence analysis to probe GumK dynamics and substrate specificity. We show that GumK undergoes twisting and bending motions constrained by interdomain contacts and modulated by membrane anchoring. Acceptor-substrate binding within an amphiphilic clamp promotes opening, whereas donor-substrate binding stabilizes closure, defining a substrate-dependent catalytic cycle. Specificity for UDP-glucuronate is mediated by a conserved electrostatic environment centered on Lys307 and a hydrophobic triad that orients the sugar moiety. On the acceptor side, the binding site selectively accommodates polyisoprenyl carriers up to three isoprene units in length and wraps around the substrate, constraining the trisaccharide moiety in a catalytically competent conformation.

Conventionally, the viscosity is measured and optimized in labor-intensive experimental workflows that require a lot of material. While predicting the viscosity with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations is feasible, they are computationally prohibitively expensive due to the large system sizes and the long simulation times involved. Coarse-grained MD (CG-MD) simulations significantly reduce computational demands, but evaluating their accuracy and predictive power requires rigorous validation. Here, we assess the capability of the Martini 3 CG force field to predict the viscosity of high-concentration antibody solutions. We show that a refined Martini 3 force field, with optimized protein-protein interactions, can accurately predict the elevated viscosities observed in concentrated solutions of F(ab')2 fragments of the therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) omalizumab. Furthermore, we show that our previously developed Martini 3-exc model for arginine excipients successfully captures the trend of lowering viscosity, as observed in our rheology experiments.

Sideways locomotion is a defining feature of true crabs (Brachyura) and may have contributed to their ecological success. Yet, the evolutionary origin of this unique behavior remains unknown. Here we show that the prevalence of sideways locomotion in true crabs reflects a single evolutionary origin from a forward-moving ancestor. Our behavioral analysis of 50 live crab species indicates that crab locomotion can be separated into two distinct types, sideways and forward locomotion, with no intermediates. The phylogenetic comparative analysis revealed a single origin of sideways locomotion, with multiple independent reversions to forward locomotion in ecologically specialized groups. The species richness data show that the lineage in which sideways locomotion originated is far more diverse than its nearest outgroups. These results suggest that sideways locomotion acted as a key innovation, potentially promoting adaptive radiation by enabling true crabs to exploit a wide range of ecological niches. Such a rare but innovative behavioral trait provides a framework for understanding how locomotor modes shape evolutionary diversification in animals.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Using resting-state fMRI from 584 neonates in the Developing Human Connectome Project, we provide the first comprehensive systems-level characterization of human visual cortex within hours of birth and across the third trimester of gestation. We discover that newborns possess a sophisticated visual architecture already functionally organized into three distinct pathways (ventral, lateral, and dorsal), each exhibiting posterior-to-anterior hierarchical structure and adult-like topographic organization. This tripartite visual organization differs from the bipartite organization observed in macaques, suggesting this architecture emerges through intrinsic developmental mechanisms rather than being a product of extensive postnatal experience and environmental adaptation. Moreover, pathway segregation, hierarchical ordering, and connectivity maturity all strengthen progressively with gestational age, revealing that visual cortical organization emerges through an active developmental program that unfolds across late gestation. Yet, despite this large-scale structure, individual pathways follow strikingly different maturation trajectories: dorsal areas exhibit a near-adult-like functional organization, even at the earliest gestational timepoints tested, whereas ventral areas remain immature and poised for experience-dependent refinement. These findings reframe our understanding of early visual development by revealing that complex functional networks emerge before substantial visual experience, yet are differentially prepared for plasticity, providing crucial insights into how evolution has optimized the brain for rapid learning while maintaining the flexibility needed for adaptation to diverse environments.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Built in Python and available open-source, FLIM Playground runs on all major operating systems as a ready-to-run app and can also be deployed on the web. The Data Extraction section interactively collects and checks field-of-view metadata, calibrates either via instrument response function (IRF) shift or reference dye, and extracts single-cell fluorescence lifetime features, both fitted and phasor, along with morphology and texture features across all channels. Multiple datasets spanning time, samples, or treatments can be merged through an interface that assigns categorical labels for downstream analyses. The Data Analysis section accepts either outputs from the Data Extraction or user-provided datasets. It provides visual analytic methods that share common interactive controls to visualize and filter large datasets in real time through a graphical user interface (GUI). Validation of lifetime fitting with FLIM Playground was performed by comparison with SPCImage using two-photon autofluorescence FLIM of Panc1 cells. Additionally, two-photon autofluorescence FLIM of Panc1 and MCF7 cells treated with metabolic inhibitors were used to demonstrate FLIM Playground features.

Relapsed AML remains largely unresponsive to current therapies and carries a poor prognosis. We developed a large-language model (LLM) agent that incorporates multi-modal data to nominate druggable therapeutic targets for AML. We identified that higher expression of AGTR2 (encoding AT2R) is associated with better chemotherapy response and longer survival. In functional studies of 68 primary human AML samples, we found that LSCs consistently lacked AT2R expression. Across both CD34-expressing and -non-expressing AML samples, AT2R expression positively correlated with CD34 and CD117 expression. In patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models using 21 primary AML samples, AT2R- cells initiated leukemia, whereas AT2R+ cells failed to do so. AT2R- cells gave rise to both AT2R+ and AT2R- progeny, suggesting hierarchical differentiation. Following chemotherapy in AML PDX mice, bone marrow analysis showed a marked enrichment of AT2R- cells and depletion of AT2R+ cells, indicating that AT2R- cells drive minimal residual disease and relapse. These results support the role of AT2R absence as a marker of LSCs. We observed reduced AT2R expression in AML cells compared to healthy peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells, suggesting a tumor suppressor role. Whole-genome sequencing of AML patients revealed no functional mutations in AGTR2. However, 3D chromatin and epigenetic analyses uncovered frequent chromatin rearrangements involving AGTR2 promoter-silencer interactions, indicating epigenetic silencing as a likely mechanism for AT2R downregulation in AML. To validate the tumor suppressor role of AT2R, we developed murine AML models driven by MLL-AF9 or AML1-ETO9a fusions with either Agtr2 knockdown or enforced expression. Agtr2 knockdown accelerated leukemogenesis, while enforced Agtr2 expression delayed AML progression. In these models, enforced Agtr2 expression reduced LSC frequency, impaired cell cycle progression, and decreased AML stemness, as confirmed by limiting dilution assays and analysis of LSC-enriched populations. Mechanistically, enforced Agtr2 expression suppressed fatty acid metabolism - a key driver of AML stemness and growth - and inhibited downstream signaling pathways, including GSK3, PI3K/AKT, and Wnt/b-catenin. This led to reduced SREBF1 activity, confirmed by protein level changes and CUT&Tag assays. We tested buloxibutid (C21), a small-molecule AT2R agonist currently in phase II trials for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, in AML PDX models derived from 20 de novo and 6 relapsed AML samples. C21 significantly inhibited AML progression and enhanced the efficacy of chemotherapy, particularly in relapsed AML models.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

This dual effect on epithelial immunity and antibiotic accessibility was conserved across multiple UPEC strains and antibiotic classes.

Despite the exciting promise of this new sensor, it was still unclear if SnxA unbiasedly reported on PI(3,5)P2 levels and how its sensitivity compared to other PI(3,5)P2 biosensors. In this work, we addressed these gaps by using a recruitable PIKfyve construct to demonstrate that ectopically generated PI(3,5)P2 at mitochondria was sufficient to recruit SnxA. Further, we co-expressed putative PI(3,5)P2 biosensors to definitively show that SnxA is more sensitive to PI(3,5)P2. We also validated previous results by showing that SnxA depends on PI(3,5)P2 for membrane binding, SnxA responds to PI(3,5)P2 production at endosomes, and that PI(3,5)P2 levels decline quickly when its production is inhibited.

Here, we investigate the capacity of Azospira suillum PS, a model facultative perchlorate-reducing bacterium, to synthesize PHB. We show that unlike most organisms, PHB production is growth-associated both aerobically, and anaerobically with perchlorate as an electron acceptor under moderate nitrogen deplete conditions.

Sequencing analysis of the variety of sRNAs representing the entire RNA fragmentome would improve our understanding of their roles in cancer development and help to discover novel sRNA biomarkers for cancer diagnostics and personalized treatments.

These mutualisms consist of food provisioning by plants and, their counterpart, plant propagule (seeds) movement by the animals, being crucial for the natural vegetation regeneration in many ecosystems. Yet we are far from understanding which part of this enormous interaction biodiversity is needed for their maintenance. I overview the diversity of interaction modes involved in these mutualisms, the main components of the seed dispersal services, and their functional diversity. I examine how interaction richness covaries with partner species richness at different scales, resulting in variable patterns of species complementarities in terms of seed dispersal effects. The functionality of most generalized plant-frugivore mutualisms relies on complementarity of effects across a high diversity of partners, yet frequently depends on just a distinct subset of them, resulting in high functional redundancy. Two distinct aspects are relevant: 1) variable quantitative effects among species; 2) variable pairwise-interaction outcomes, between the extremes of antagonism and mutualism. Frugivory, occurring at the final stage of each plant reproductive episode, entails a large, cumulative, effect of other biotic interactions occurring at earlier stages (e.g., floral herbivory, pollination, pre-dispersal fruit damage). I examine how plant-frugivore interactions mix-up with the whole biotic interactome of a plant, using the Prunus mahaleb system as a case study. The effects of distinct subsets of frugivores combine with different sets of antagonistic and mutualistic partners in other interactions, yet having a lasting signal on final seed dispersal success.\n\nAbbreviated abstractPairwise plant-frugivore mutualistic interactions aggregate into highly diverse networks crucial for seed dispersal and ecosystem regeneration, but the exact subset of interactions essential to maintain these systems remains unclear.

Existing solutions are limited to specific scenarios, require considerable computational resources, or are otherwise unscalable. Consequently, many large, disease-relevant protein complexes in the human proteome, as well as nearly all viruses and numerous other classes, are impractical to model with high fidelity for drug development. To modulate these protein complexes and viruses, structural information is eminently valuable, and often essential. In the last two years, machine learning based-tools that can generate binders to a given target structure with high hit rates have emerged. Combined with high-throughput screening, these technologies can far outpace traditional drug discovery. However, they cannot function well without accurate models of their target structures. Thus, to unlock the full power of AI-driven drug discovery, a scalable method must be developed to predict large protein complex structures. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Cosmohedra, a physics-based method to rapidly and accurately predict the structure of arbitrarily large, symmetric protein complexes. Validated across 4 major symmetry classes (icosahedral, tetrahedral, octahedral, and cyclic), the method consistently achieves near-experimental levels of accuracy, i.e., RMSD < 5 [A].

These molecules penetrate the cytoplasm poorly and are very often non-functional within the cell. Sequence analysis of 106 antibody variable domains alongside the cytoplasmic human proteome shows charge and isoelectric point are characteristics ill adapted to intracellular monodispersity. Characterisation of forty-five single-chain variable fragment (scFv) intrabodies expressed in human cells confirmed charge to have the greatest impact on solubility. We created new interdomain linkers, optimised scFv domain orientation and found variable heavy domain framework sites to be generally positively charged, and promote insolubility, but be amenable to optimisation. This is applied in combination to reduce the search space and refine the products of AI-led inverse folding to create highly soluble, abundant and thermally stable intrabodies that maintain parent antibody epitope recognition. Over six hundred intrabody sequences are described targeting sixty cytoplasmic proteins with linear, conformational, post-translational modification or oligomeric state specificity. Interactions were validated for p53, -synuclein, SOD1, polyQ, FUS/TLS, UCHL1 and GFP.

This study evaluated the validity of the Wesen temperament test by examining its association with physiological biomarkers--salivary cortisol and serotonin. Twenty-four dogs (11 females and 13 males) completed a modified Wesen test comprising seven subtests: Unconscious Confidence, Sociality, Noise Stability, Movement Stability, Desire for Play and Predation, Behavior in Stressful Situations, and Separation. Saliva samples were collected pre- and post-assessment, and cortisol and serotonin levels were measured using ELISA. Hormonal levels and temperament scores were analyzed using correlation, regression, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Pre-assessment cortisol levels were negatively correlated with total average temperament score and several subtest scores. Post-assessment cortisol levels showed significant negative correlations with total average scores and all subtests. Changes in cortisol levels from pre- to post-assessment were negatively associated with temperament scores. Dogs with higher temperament scores exhibited significantly higher serotonin levels than those with lower scores. These findings support the utility of temperament assessments validated through physiological markers and provide novel evidence linking canine temperament with endocrine function.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

These signals are processed through cell type specific circuits traditionally defined by MSN dopamine receptor expression. However, classification by dopamine receptor type alone fails to fully specify MSN diversity and falls short of capturing the functional complexity of the striatum. Here, we combined single-nucleus multi-omic sequencing and high-plex spatial transcriptomics to build a comprehensive atlas of MSNs in the macaque striatum. Using multi-omic sequencing, we profiled MSNs across four anatomically and functionally defined territories, and we mapped these subtypes back into their anatomical context by integrating the multi-omic data with ~5.4 million spatially resolved cells sampled across the full rostral-caudal and dorsal-ventral extent of the striatum. This approach revealed two previously undocumented ventral striatum (VS) subtypes, D1-VS-RGS6 and D2-VS-RGS6, which are molecularly distinct from known ventral striatal MSNs yet share core limbic features. We also uncovered gradients in matrix-compartment cell types along the rostral-caudal axis. Finally, by integrating MSN subtype-specific transcriptomes and ATAC-seq-derived regulatory annotations with human GWAS data, we demonstrate strong, cell-type-specific enrichment of polygenic risk for Parkinson's disease, substance use disorders, and psychiatric and cognitive traits, including a striking association of D2-VS-RGS6 with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Dual-stream topology - functionally distinct visuomotor and perceptual pathways - emerged spontaneously with rich cross-communication. Shapley value analyses revealed that action- and perception-selective features developed progressively across depth, reflecting task-driven hierarchical specialization. Time-resolved EEG showed that model activity mapped onto dissociable temporal components in human cortex: ventral-aligned signals emerged early and late, where dorsal- and ventral-aligned responses coincided in the intervening interval.

This study compared cilia orientation in principal excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex across turtles, mice, and macaques to identify patterns to infer mechanisms of cortical evolution. We first developed custom MATLAB Apps to facilitate the fast identification and statistical analyses of cilia orientation. We found that generally the primary cilia of principal neurons in sparse inside-out laminated regions, including the macaque and mouse neocortex, macaque CA1, mouse entorhinal cortex and neighboring regions, and mouse piriform cortex layer III, orient toward the pia. In contrast, primary cilia in compact laminae of these species, including the macaque and mouse dentate gyrus (DG), macaque CA3, mouse piriform cortex layer II, and turtle lateral cortex manifest opposite orientations, positioning perpendicular to the laminae. These data suggest that over the course of cortical evolution, primary cilia in principal neurons evolve from initially having no preferred orientation to becoming increasingly oriented toward the pial surface. We propose a working model for cortical evolution: the placement of principal neurons progresses from minimal migration in lower vertebrates to forward migration in higher species, and ultimately to pronounced reverse soma movement in higher inside-out laminated cortices, driven by the accumulation of large neuronal populations in the outer layers after completing radial migration.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

We observed overlapping hemodynamic traveling waves across domains, with auditory-motor regions activated earlier, followed by visual, posterior parietal, and Sylvian parietal-temporal (Spt) regions, supporting sensorimotor transformation and online monitoring of production. Increasing rhythmic complexity elicited slower and stronger activations in both domains: compared with baseline, regular rhythm control elicited delayed and amplified responses, while irregular rhythm control produced the slowest and strongest responses. During music production, rhythm-related activity expanded into frontal and temporal language regions, suggesting that higher rhythmic demands engage language resources.

J.; Woolgar, A.; Buckley, M.; Duncan, J.", "abstract": "Learning often depends on feedback, yet how positive and negative outcomes reorganize target representations to support later memory retrieval remains poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) acts as a central hub linking learning and retrieval, raising the possibility that it plays a critical role in this process. Here we analysed spiking activity and local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from vlPFC while monkeys performed a multi-cycle object-learning task. During the initial learning cycle, correct and incorrect feedback elicited distinct neural responses in both spiking and LFPs. In particular, positive feedback produced elevated theta power and enhanced theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling (TG-PAC), associated with sustained suppression of neural spiking. Incorrect feedback induced stronger beta power. Despite comparable levels of object information under both feedback conditions, decoders trained and tested within the same feedback state outperformed those tested across states, revealing feedback-dependent coding formats. State-space analyses further showed that object representations following positive feedback were geometrically closer to those reinstated during later retrieval, indicating that feedback reshapes neural geometry toward retrieval-compatible states. Moreover, these geometric effects were selectively expressed on electrodes showing stronger TG-PAC or beta power, suggesting that oscillatory coordination may regulate how feedback signals are transformed into stable target codes. Together, our results reveal how vlPFC serve as a critical bridge between learning and memory retrieval, with feedback-driven dynamics reorganizing population geometry through rhythmic coordination and bringing successful outcome states closer to future retrieval representations.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

This segregation is particularly damaging to translational fields that are in need of the combined strength of these two major approaches. While studies are increasingly recognizing the value of integrated approaches through hybrid methods, these efforts require great resources. To potentially relieve this interdisciplinary detachment, we uncover similarities between behavioral and molecular work in the publication network to test if the two approaches are more aligned than they appear, through deeper common concepts. To do this, we first create a model to predict genes that are relevant to behavioral publications from their abstracts. These predictions are in turn used to define gene-based similarity across the entire medical literature network. This model is built on-top of a Large Language Model (LLM), used to find patterns in the semantic structure of abstracts. Our experiments demonstrated the model's efficacy in predicting gene annotations in molecular abstracts and showed the practical value of predictions made on behavioral research. We found similar increased relative risks for differentially expressed genes in disease-specific publications compared to the global publication population in both the molecular and behavioral groups. Additionally, the model was able to correlate gene predictions between molecular publications and their behavioral references. We instantiated this model in a free and easy to use search engine that finds related publications via the latent representations we've established.

Old tumor cells showed reduced expression of interferon-related genes, particularly the T cell-recruiting chemokines Cxcl9 and Cxcl10, linked to their altered chromatin accessibility. CXCL9/10 expression also declined with age in human HER2+ tumors. Correspondingly, old tumors exhibited fewer T cells within tumor lesions.

More broadly, however, neurons semantic tunings differed substantially by language, suggesting language-specific neural implementations. Despite this, distances between words neural responses are preserved between the two languages, creating a shared semantic geometry.

CYM5442 also reduced drinking in dependent mice in the chronic intermittent ethanol vapor paradigm of dependence-induced increased drinking paired with 2 bottle-choice (CIE-2BC) as well as in non-dependent mice.

In diderm bacteria, it comprises an inner membrane, a thin peptidoglycan layer, and an outer membrane. A stable outer membrane-peptidoglycan connection is crucial for envelope integrity, preventing outer membrane detachment and enabling the generation of periplasmic turgor that counterbalances cytoplasmic pressure, thereby limiting susceptibility to antibiotics and environmental stressors. In Escherichia coli, the major lipoprotein Lpp (Brauns lipoprotein) serves as the only covalent linker between the outer membrane and peptidoglycan, through its unique C-terminal lysine residue. Homologs of Lpp are widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae, including Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, which encodes LppA and LppB. While Lpp and LppA function similarly, the role of LppB remains unclear. Using E. coli as a surrogate model, we investigated the structural and functional properties of Salmonella LppB. Here, we demonstrate that LppB forms disulfide-linked dimers via its unique C-terminal cysteine and crosslinks to peptidoglycan through its terminal lysine, albeit with significantly lower efficiency than Lpp. Notably, LppB interacts with Lpp to form heterotrimers, thereby reducing overall Lpp-peptidoglycan crosslinking. These findings suggest that LppB modulates outer membrane-peptidoglycan tethering by fine-tuning the bacterial envelope architecture in response to environmental conditions. Given the established link between outer membrane-peptidoglycan uncoupling and outer membrane vesicles (OMV) formation, a key mechanism in bacterial pathogenicity, our results suggest a model in which LppB regulates outer membrane-peptidoglycan attachment, potentially influencing OMV production.

To facilitate use, a user-friendly search engine was developed to retrieve a protein of interest and returns its pKa values, isoelectric points of both cytoplasmic and extra-cytoplasmic faces, and an automated screening of active-site residues. In the end, two case studies were proposed to demonstrate how pKa's from MPKaDB could be applied to explore the pH-dependent relationship between membrane protein structure and function.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

At the single-molecule level, cohesin extrudes DNA loops, a process thought to drive higher-order genome folding. In vertebrates, cohesin incorporates either STAG1 or STAG2. Although both support sister chromatid cohesion, they differentially regulate 3D genome organization. However, the mechanistic basis for these differences has remained unclear. Here we show, using single-molecule assays, that cohesin-STAG1 extrudes DNA loops more efficiently than cohesin-STAG2, despite comparable ATPase activity and topological DNA entrapment. We identify an AT-hook motif unique to the STAG1 N-terminus as the element that promotes loop extrusion without altering ATPase activity or DNA binding. In human somatic cells, the AT-hook is required for stable cohesin-chromatin association during G1 phase but is dispensable for sister chromatid cohesion. Mutation of this motif markedly impairs TAD and chromatin loop formation. These findings highlight AT-hook as a critical determinant that distinguishes STAG1 from STAG2 by promoting DNA loop extrusion and stabilizing cohesin-chromatin interactions in interphase through a mechanism distinct from the one underlying sister chromatid cohesion.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Zebrafish studies have revealed increased activation of the Akt/mTor signaling pathway after mutation of hcfc1a, one ortholog of HCFC1. mTOR hyperactivation is linked to seizures and its inhibition alleviates epilepsy in other preclinical models. We hypothesized that mTor overactivity in hcfc1a mutant zebrafish increases seizure susceptibility and/or severity. We employed a two-concentration model of the seizure inducing agent, pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), with or without pretreatment of the mTor inhibitor, torin1. Mutation of hcfc1a did not increase seizure susceptibility at sub-optimal concentrations of PTZ and the pharmaceutical inhibition of mTor reduced seizure severity when utilized at a dose of 250nM. Higher doses of torin1 treatment exacerbated seizure response in mutant larvae but not in wildtype siblings. These data suggest that in an hcfc1a deficient background, moderate inhibition of mTor signaling may partially alleviate seizure phenotypes, however, over-inhibition of the pathway causes a refractory response to PTZ. Collectively, we present a model that can be used to test dose response and for the development of combinatorial treatment approaches in a high throughput manner.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

C.; Smith, J.; Narum, S.

White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), the largest freshwater fish in North America, have experienced at least two rounds of whole genome duplication, and may exhibit both di- and multi-valent meiotic segregation. Moreover, they exhibit contemporary ploidy variants due to spontaneous autopolyploidy, particularly in aquaculture. Nonetheless, as a species with several population segments that exhibit chronic recruitment failure, conservation aquaculture is an important part of their management. To facilitate the development of genetic tools to aid white sturgeon conservation, as well as a basis to understand how ploidy changes and variation historically and contemporarily shape the evolution of this species, we present a genome assembly for a white sturgeon from the Snake River, Idaho, USA. Analysis of sequence data used for assembly indicated a haploid genome size of approximately 1.5Gbp, implying tetraploidy (4N), while analysis of heterozygous k-mers from 21 to 41 bp suggest the genome reflects both 4N and 8N variants. The final genome assembly, scaffolded using linkage maps constructed from Fraser River and Snake River F1 families, contained 6.26Gbp in 832,145 scaffolds, consistent with published genome size estimates. Conserved ortholog completeness for this genome (90.5%; 22.8% single-copy and 67.7% duplicated) was similar to the putatively diploid sterlet sturgeon, and the largest linkage map-based scaffold was 55.2Gbp, though the N50 for this assembly was only 416Kbp, indicating the assembly remains fragmented. We demonstrate the utility of this assembly by identifying genomic regions significantly associated with sex. Genetic markers, designed for inclusion in an amplicon genotyping panel, predicted sex 96.6% and 81.5% correctly in females and males, respectively, providing a strong overall association (?82 p-value < 2.7x10-37) with some variation by geographic region.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Our study aims to characterize the stress responses of a group of captive working elephants longitudinally while desensitizing certain procedures and training assistive behaviours. We documented the duration and frequency of stress signals presented by elephants during regular training sessions over a four month period. We found that as sessions progressed, elephants displayed fewer stress signals - suggesting a decrease in stress with continued exposure to training.

A troop of six otters was observed at Lincolnshire Wildlife Park (United Kingdom) using camera-traps placed at three key locations in their enclosure: outside of their den, at the main feeding area, and at a rock-garden foraging area. A total of 2895 video clips were analysed using a hierarchical ethogram consisting of the behavioural categories of locomotion, stationary, vocalisation, physical affiliative, sustenance, and OMBs. The most commonly observed behaviours were walking (21.5%), lying (20.8%) and feeding (12.2%). OMBs were observed in 3.9% of total observations. Otters performed OMBs significantly more often outside their den than at the other locations. Grooming was also more frequent at this location. There was a negative association between the expression of OMBs and air temperature.

Following injury, the formation of a hematoma establishes a provisional niche that initiates and regulates healing responses. However, the influence of hematoma viscoelastic properties on immune cell behavior remains poorly understood. Here, we show that distinct ECM viscoelastic properties of the maturing fracture hematoma steer macrophage polarization from pro-inflammatory to pro-regenerative characteristics. Tissue analyses of ex vivo human samples revealed that hematoma viscoelastic properties change with ECM remodeling during healing progression, with the late-phase stress relaxation time constant, {tau}2, increasing significantly with days post-injury. Using alginate hydrogels in 3D culture, we engineered extracellular microenvironments with tunable {tau}2 but constant stiffness to study their role in macrophage polarization. Our data demonstrate that ECM {tau}2 properties guide macrophage phenotype, characterized by high {tau}2 promoting pro-inflammatory activation, while low {tau}2 supported anti-inflammatory phenotypes. This regulation of macrophage polarization by ECM stress relaxation properties persists even under toll-like receptor-coactivation. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed distinct transcriptional programs associated with different ECM {tau}2 values, with many of the differentially expressed genes related to metabolic processes. The transcriptomic profiles of macrophages primed by different ECM {tau}2 aligned with in vivo healing trajectories, with the gene signature score of the low ECM {tau}2 decreasing over time. Our findings uncover the immune-regulatory function of specific hematoma stress relaxation properties associated with healing progress after injury, and suggest {tau}2 as potential mechanobiological target to be leveraged in novel biomaterials-based regenerative therapies.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

In phylogenetic trees, a subset of k taxa with maximum phylogenetic diversity can be found by a simple and efficient greedy algorithm.

To address this challenge, we introduce PaNDA (Phylogenetic Network Diversity Algorithms), the first software package and interactive graphical user-interface for exploring, visualizing and maximizing diversity in phylogenetic networks. PaNDA includes a novel algorithm to find a subset of k taxa with maximum diversity, running in polynomial time for networks of bounded scanwidth, a measure of tree-likeness of a network that grows slower than the well-known level measure. This algorithm considers the variant of phylogenetic diversity on networks in which the branch lengths of all paths from the root to the selected taxa contribute towards their diversity. We demonstrate the scalability of this algorithm on simulated networks, successfully analyzing level-15 networks with up to 200 taxa in seconds. We also provide a proof-of-concept analysis using a phylogenetic network on Xiphophorus species, illustrating how the tool can support diversity studies based on real genomic data. The software is easily installable and freely available at https://github.com/nholtgrefe/panda. Additionally, we extend the definition of phylogene- tic diversity to semi-directed phylogenetic networks, which are mixed graphs increasingly used in phylogenetic analysis to model uncertainty of the root location.

The reduced-order tumor microenvironment model uses histology-informed extracellular matrix (ECM) tumor domain and packing fraction, together with explicit glycocalyx-patch electrohydrodynamics (EHD) at the tumor vessel wall. At the fenestra, EHD increases inlet plasma intensity relative to a non-EHD framework across all models (means: 0.576 non-EHD vs 0.722 EHD; gain 25.34%). Numerical simulations of plasma perfusion in both the tumor ECM domain and a microfluidic benchmark exhibit two-stage kinetics, with an initial advection-dominated regime. The RAD model reproduces this behavior and, after a simple temporal calibration to account for pore-scale hydrodynamic acceleration resolved by computational fluid dynamics (CFD), matches the observed propagation. By using fully resolved, EHD-inclusive multiphase CFD simulations to calibrate a reduced-order RAD model parameterized by measurable geometric features, we bridge the gap between classical Darcy-Starling tissue perfusion models and fully resolved CFD.

This study examined how cognitive load and task complexity affect gaze behaviour and gait biomechanics during a precision target-stepping task in healthy young adults. We also quantified the frequency of cross-stepping during the experimental task. Twenty-three participants (18-23 years) walked along an L-shaped pathway containing raised stepping targets under single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) conditions. Targets had four different layouts to create high and low difficulty conditions. Eye movements were recorded using mobile eye-tracking, and gait kinematics were captured via motion capture. Compared with ST, DT walking produced slower walking speeds, longer stance times, and reduced velocity between stepping targets, indicating a more inefficient gait strategy. Eye-tracking analyses revealed fewer and shorter fixations on task-relevant targets and a greater number of fixations directed toward task-irrelevant areas under DT conditions. In DT, saccadic amplitudes were reduced despite increased outside fixations, suggesting a breakdown in visual exploration between proximal and distal regions of the walkway. Cross-stepping was more frequent in ST conditions than in DT. These findings indicate that increased cognitive load compromises proactive visual search, likely through working-memory and attentional limitations that disrupt feedforward gait planning. Contrary to expectation, cross-stepping occurred more often during ST than DT walking, suggesting that in this population cross-stepping may not be a maladaptive strategy. Overall, these results highlight the cognitive demands of adaptive walking even in young, low-risk individuals and underscore the importance of preserving visual-motor coordination under cognitive stress.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Although mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium stress, and -synuclein aggregation have each been implicated, none alone explains why anatomically similar populations exhibit such different fates. Here we develop a minimal two-variable energetic model that captures only mitochondrial functional capacity, energetic reserve, and the combined load from axonal arborization and calcium handling. Despite its simplicity, the model reveals that increasing structural load deforms the energetic landscape until a saddle-node bifurcation emerges, producing coexisting healthy-energy and collapsed-energy states. SNc-like neurons, which bear extreme axonal and calcium-handling demands, reside inside this bistable regime, operating near a separatrix that renders them vulnerable to even modest metabolic perturbations. In contrast, VTA-like neurons lie outside the bistable window and robustly return to their high-energy state following similar disturbances. The model reproduces hallmark features of Parkinsonian degeneration - long periods of stability, sudden irreversible collapse, and population-specific susceptibility - using only the geometry of load-dependent energy regulation. These findings suggest that selective SNc vulnerability arises not from unique molecular defects, but from the fundamental dynamical structure imposed by their extraordinary anatomical and physiological load.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

To approach this question, we adopted a multi-dimensional task-set interference paradigm that requires individuals to handle distractions from three independent dimensions. Behavioral results suggest that people track prior interference from each dimension to selectively modulate their attentional gain. Testing the mechanism of this adaptation at the neural level requires measuring multi-dimensional task representations. To achieve this, we applied representational similarity analyses and encoding models to human EEG and investigated how the history of interference simultaneously affected the time-resolved representations of target and distractor dimensions. EEG analyses revealed that target and distractor features are initially encoded in parallel, but distractors are rapidly suppressed around 250 ms, with suppression scaling with prior interference. Proactive task-level control enhanced the efficiency of this reactive suppression, without producing sustained preparatory changes. Behavioral and neural effects converged to show that dimension-specific interference and adaptation are associated with the speed of visual integration of each dimension, as captured by a connectionist model with temporal integration. Altogether, these results suggest that proactive control mechanisms operate on the speed and efficiency of a reactive suppression mechanism that constrains selective distractor representations from biasing the response process.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

We subjected samples from subjects with or without EoE to flow cytometry (n = 74 peripheral blood, 17 biopsy) and scRNA-seq (n = 27 peripheral blood, 10 biopsy). Expression of GPR15 by peripheral peTh2 cells was increased in EoE, and these cells expressed increased CD38 in active EoE-- findings recapitulated in esophageal biopsies. We also identified a peTh2-associated, CD38-containing gene expression program that peripheral GPR15+ peTh2 cells upregulated in active EoE. The level of upregulation was distinct from other circulating peTh2 cells and was more similar to that seen in esophageal peTh2 cells. An association between expression of GPR15 by peripheral peTh2 cells, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor was strongest in subjects with EoE, suggesting an environmental exposure or susceptibility. The magnitude of GPR15 expression by peripheral peTh2 cells could effectively in discriminate active EoE from no EoE in our study population (AUC 0.93).

The earliest metazoans evolved in shallow marine shelves of the Neoproterozoic era, where the redox environment was likely variable and spatially heterogenous. This imposed physiological constraints on the emerging animals, selecting for oxygen-responsive and stress-adaptive traits. Embryogenesis is a novel and highly conserved stage of metazoan development, and its regulatory architecture may hold the key to understanding how adaptive traits arise in response to environmental change. Defining how early metazoan embryos respond to fluctuating oxygen levels will therefore provide essential insights into the adaptive mechanisms that shaped the evolution of metazoans. Here, the embryos of the cnidarian Nematostella vectensis, a representative of early-diverging metazoans, were used to comprehensively investigate the developmental and genetic responses to hypoxia. N. vectensis embryogenesis is oxygen-dependent, with hypoxia inducing a reversible developmental arrest. Transcriptomic profiling reveals that the hypoxia response in N. vectensis embryos is conserved with bilaterians, encompassing core hypoxia-responsive genes and pathways.

However, because nearly all cells in the body possess cell-autonomous circadian oscillators, developing cell-type-specific reporter systems is essential to dissect how these oscillators interact within complex multicellular tissues and are modulated by brain-body circadian signals. The intestine is a complex organ composed of diverse cell types with distinct origins and functions, and it exhibits robust daily rhythms in physiological activities driven by intrinsic circadian clocks. While the circadian regulation of the mucosal compartment, including the intestinal epithelium, has been relatively well characterized, the mechanisms governing the circadian rhythms in the cells of the muscularis externa remain largely unexplored. Here, we report a novel Cre-dependent Per2-luciferase reporter mouse that enables precise measurement of circadian oscillations in specific peripheral cell populations ex vivo and demonstrate its utility in revealing the hierarchical circadian chrono-architecture within the intestine. Ex vivo gut explants from mice expressing the reporter in one of five major cell types of the muscularis externa-enteric neurons (ENs), enteric glial cells (EGCs), interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and muscularis macrophages (MMs)-exhibited robust, self-sustained circadian bioluminescence rhythms, indicating that all of these cell types possess cell-autonomous circadian oscillators. Notably, ENs in the small intestine entrained more rapidly to feeding schedules than did those in the colon, revealing regional differences in food entrainment among the gut clocks. Moreover, the clocks of ENs, SMCs, and MMs shifted their phase in response to daytime-restricted feeding, whereas ICC clocks remained unaffected even after three weeks of restricted feeding. These findings demonstrate that distinct intestinal cell types possess unique entrainment properties and that feeding rhythms can induce heterogeneous phase shifts within the gut clocks. Given that circadian disruption, such as that caused by shift work, contributes to intestinal disorders, this reporter system could provide a powerful platform to dissect the mechanisms linking intercellular circadian desynchrony to intestinal homeostasis.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we present the first large-scale eigendecomposition of whole-brain effective connectivity (EC), estimated from resting-state fMRI using sparse Dynamic Causal Modeling. We isolate the irreversible component of EC, which encodes the directionality of information flow and forms a comprehensive hierarchical network of forward and backward interactions. This hierarchy strengthens in brain states approaching criticality, where slow, oscillatory modes dominate and reflects the influence of long-range anatomical connections that scaffold whole-brain information flow. Our decomposition provides the first multiscale quantification of temporal irreversibility, revealing dual counterpropagating streams along the unimodal-transmodal axis operating at distinct frequencies. Crucially, these hierarchical dynamics carry robust, individual-specific signatures, with unimodal networks contributing disproportionately to subject identifiability.

Resistance is due to sequential acquisition of point mutations in the two-component system LiaFSR and in cardiolipin synthases and is associated with alteration of phospholipid and glycolipid membrane composition. The molecular mechanisms underlying these lipid changes are currently unknown. Similarly, it is unclear why mutations in liaFSR occur prior to mutations in cls. We discovered that Enterococcus faecalis remodels membrane composition as a phenotypic response to daptomycin that parallels the membrane composition of DAPR strains. The enrichment in glycolipids that follows antibiotic exposure is due to LtaS1, the main LTA synthase of E. faecalis. Moreover, LtaS1 activity is governed by a network of two-component systems formed by LiaFSR, SapRS, and BsrRS that couple antibiotic sensing with membrane lipid remodeling.

The chiral livebearer (Xenophallus umbratilis) exemplifies these deficits. This freshwater livebearing fish species primarily occupies habitats along the high-elevation fringes of large volcanoes in the central cordillera of Costa Rica. Previous work suggests that current populations have been isolated by repeated marine incursions beginning around 5 mya. Genetic data point to four putative clades that could be considered evolutionarily distinct. Unfortunately, beyond this we know little about adaptive evolution of demographically relevant traits among these clades, making it difficult to determine the conservation status of this species overall. Moreover, a recent IUCN assessment of this species was limited to only a portion of its geographic range and lacked population level information from many locations where it occurs. To address these gaps, here we describe the life history of this species, taken from 23 collections made across its geographic range from locations where this fish is locally abundant. This allowed us to determine if life history traits differ among populations coincident with known population structure. Despite long periods of isolation among clades, we found only modest evidence for divergence in life history phenotypes, and this was limited to just two of the four clades.

This goal requires both a standardized dataset for evaluation and powerful models that overcome data limitations. Here, we make a dual contribution to this endeavor: the NC-Bench benchmark and the NCfold framework. NC-Bench offers a trusted ground for comparison with 925 sequences and 6,708 annotated NC pairs, defining tasks for edge and orientation prediction. NCfold provides a powerful analytical engine, a closed-loop dual-branch network that synergizes sequence features with structure-aware embeddings from RNA foundation models via our proposed REF-weighted self-attention. This iterative design enables robust learning from scarce NC data. On the NC-Bench benchmark, NCfold establishes new state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming existing methods. Comprehensive analyses validate its design and affirm the critical role of NC-Bench in driving future progress. NC-Bench and NCfold together form a cornerstone for the next generation of RNA structure prediction.

These interactions are crucial for cellular functions and maintaining life. Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) is very important, although challenging, for understanding cellular functions and diseases. This paper presents BioPrediction-PPI, a new end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) framework for PPI prediction, automating the entire process from feature extraction to interpretability, with no manual intervention required. BioPrediction-PPI stands as one of the few end-to-end models that do not rely on deep learning, enabling the automated use of trained models on new data. It offers interpretability graphs for creating auditable models and has been evaluated through comparative experiments with 30 previous studies, using 15 datasets. Additionally, the interpretability graphs provide useful insights for model evaluation and experimental design, supporting informed decision-making. BioPrediction-PPI demonstrates competitive performance across multiple datasets, even without the use of deep learning, and is a transparent, white-box model that can be easily used by biologists and practitioners without a background in computer science.

Here, we reveal that single-sequence protein language models (pLMs), trained solely on individual protein sequences, implicitly learn the interface contacts of homo-oligomeric assemblies. As models grow larger, their ability to predict inter-subunit contacts continues to improve, whereas the accuracy for single-chain predictions shows only minimal gains. The largest ESM2 model can accurately distinguish genuine biological interfaces from crystallographic artifacts. MSA Pairformer and ESM2-15B perform comparably when broad sets of homologs are used, but restricting alignments to closer evolutionary neighbors reveals a clear difference: MSA Pairformer reaches an interface contact recovery rate of 0.44 compared with 0.33 for ESM2-15B. We hypothesized that one contributing factor is how models implicitly cluster homologous proteins. Comparing evolutionary constraints extracted from pLMs, we find correlation between homologs decrease as model size increases, consistent with larger models partitioning families into finer-grained subclusters and better separating distinct oligomeric interfaces. When models fail to detect known interfaces, these discrepancies may reflect annotation errors, proteins that adopt multiple assembly conformations, or intrinsic model limitations. Overall, our findings show that statistical patterns learned by pLMs encode key aspects of homo-oligomeric assembly organization and provide a basis for understanding how such interfaces diversify across evolution, even though structure is conserved over large evolutionary distances, oligomeric assembly may not be.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Under short-day conditions, loss of KAKU4 or CRWN proteins uncovers a photoperiod-sensitive, progeroid-like trajectory with premature senescence, transcriptional drift, and disruption of heterochromatin maintenance. Multi-omics analyses reveal that KAKU4 occupancy is confined to euchromatin and contracts with age, while CHH and CHG methylation erosion occurs within H3K9me2-enriched, transposon-dense heterochromatin. Wild-type plants normally exhibit age-associated CHH hypermethylation at transposable elements, a process abolished in NE mutants.

Contributions to fitness include the development of emergent properties resulting in the tolerance or resistance to external stressors such as rapid environmental changes and in the context of an infection, antifungal drug exposure. The biofilm developed by the filamentous fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus develops zones of low oxygen which contribute to a reduction in antifungal drug susceptibility, however the genes and mechanisms involved in driving this emergent property of the biofilm are ill-defined. In this study, we utilized a transcriptomic approach to probe the biofilm structure in comparison to drug susceptible planktonic cultures to identify transcriptional patterns and genes unique to the A. fumigatus biofilm. Importantly we utilized two phenotypically diverse strains that allowed us to identify biofilm specific gene co-expression networks. One of these networks was highlighted by a gene encoding a ceramide synthase, designated barA, with a striking increase in barA transcript abundance specifically in the biofilm. Null mutants for barA in two strain backgrounds display altered biofilm morphology with some strain specific differences. Importantly, barA has a role in regulating susceptibility to ergosterol targeting antifungal drugs.

Both phages exhibited marked differences in survival across surfaces: copper at 37 degrees Celsius caused rapid inactivation, and cooler conditions promoted persistence. Reproductive capacity varied independently of survival, indicating that viral stability and replication are partially decoupled traits shaped by environmental context. Linear modeling and correlation analyses confirmed significant, non-additive interactions between surface type and temperature.

S.; Nair, S.; Mallik, R.", "abstract": "The liver controls plasma lipids by secreting lipid-rich very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) into blood. Inside hepatocytes in the liver, Lipid Droplets (LDs) are transported to the smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum (sER) by kinesin-1 motors, and then catabolized in the sER to supply lipids for VLDL assembly. LDs are the only cellular organelle bounded by a phospholipid monolayer, and are thus distinct from all other (bilayer-bounded) organelles. It is therefore plausible that a given protein can bind to the LD membrane using mechanisms that are completely different from all other organelles. Indeed, here we find that kinesin-1 uses its tail domain to bind LDs, but alternative mechanisms to bind LDs, but alternative mechanisms to bind other organelles. A peptide corresponding to kinesin's tail domain therefore competes with, and removes kinesin-1 selectively from LDs with minimal effect on other organelles. Delivery of lipids for VLDL assembly is consequently reduced, causing a remarkable reduction of ~50% of secreted lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol) in cell culture. We further develop Orally fed Egg-liposomes as a method to deliver kinesin tail domain peptide to the liver of Zebrafish. The peptide reverses diet-induced hyperlipidaemia in Zebrafish larvae and brings the larvae back to a normolipidaemic state, thus confirming the effectiveness of our method in a physiologically relevant in-vivo situation. Strikingly, the peptide causes no unwanted accumulation of lipids in the liver, no toxicity and no developmental or behavioural defects in Zebrafish. Using a peptide to displace proteins (e.g. kinesin) selectively from LDs provides a conceptually novel and radically different approach against hyperlipidaemia. This monolayer-versus-bilayer strategy can be potentially extended to target other LD-bound proteins that function as key regulators of Lipid metabolism.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

From March to June 2024, a total 84 h of observations were recorded yielding 343 scan samples, and modelled behaviour as a function of troop and environmental covariates (weather, habitat openness, car and human presence). Feeding dominated overall time allocation (35.4%), with no whole-budget differences among troops, but behaviour-specific contrasts emerged. Outeniqua troop inhabiting the more rural area relied significantly less on human-derived foods than Madiba and showed less running than both Madiba and North. In addition, level-3 vigilance (active/intense scanning) was higher in the troops frequenting more anthropogenic environments (Madiba, North) than in Outeniqua, suggesting that vigilance is a particularly sensitive response to human exposure. Finally, habitat openness was negatively associated with affiliative interactions, and car presence was negatively associated with resting. These results provide partial support for hypothesised disturbance effects, with shifts in behavioural sub-categories without overall budget change, clarifying how anthropogenic disturbance can restructure primate time allocation and risk perception. Such immediate behavioural responses should offer actionable insight for evidence-based conservation and human baboon conflict mitigation.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Gain-of-function mutations, such as R2482H, which slow channel inactivation, are linked to dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis (DHS) and iron overload4-7. PIEZO1 forms a gigantic bowl-shaped trimer comprising flattenable peripheral blades and a central pore module with a switchable cap8-12. However, the structural dynamics governing its gating process and pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. Here, we determined distinct conformational states of the DHS-associated PIEZO1-R2482H mutant in both detergents and proteoliposomes. Remarkably, the R2482H mutation in the central pore induces a conformational change that propagates ~25 nm to the most distal blade, enabling resolution of all 38 transmembrane helices. PIEZO1-R2482H is inherently flatter than PIEZO1, lowering the gating force and energy barrier and thus explaining its heightened mechanosensitivity. While the flattened PIEZO1 has its cap in the up-state adopting an inactivated state, the flattened PIEZO1-R2482H has its cap in the down-state and twisted by ~75 degree, drastically switching the pore module from a swapped to a non-swapped organization. Such twisted conformation of PIEZO1-R2482H might hinder the transition to the inactivated state, instead proceeding through a deactivation-transition state characterized by curved blades and a partially twisted cap, thereby accounting for the slowed inactivation and deactivation kinetics. Taken together, we reveal the full transmembrane topology and a non-swapped pore conformation induced by R2482H, and propose the structural dynamic model that delineates the distinct gating cycle of activation, inactivation, and deactivation for PIEZO1 and PIEZO1-R2482H.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

The Crested ibis (Nipponia nippon), a flagship endangered species, has a long history of captive breeding, which has contributed to population recovery. However, little is known about the specific process and characteristics of its egg development.

Demographic inferences revealed weak or no domestication bottlenecks and extensive gene flow between wild and cultivated populations. In the Occidental lineage, dessert and perry P. communis cultivars underwent independent domestications from the same wild progenitor, P. pyraster, with divergent selection linked to fruit use. In the Oriental lineage, regionally independent domestications gave rise to Chinese and Japanese P. pyrifolia cultivars, shaped by both environmental adaptation and human selection. Selection scans identified lineage- and use-specific targets related to fruit texture, metabolism, and immunity.

Across two experiments, participants engaged in structured breathing practices manipulating either respiratory frequency (slow breathing vs. fast breathing) or the inhalation-exhalation ratio (short inspiration-long expiration; long inspiration-short expiration) prior to performing a visual emotion discrimination task. Immediately after breathing practice, participant's respiration deviated from their baseline: each technique resulted in specific deviations of respiratory frequency, inhalation-exhalation ratio, or the occurrence of atypical respiratory cycles, suggesting technique-specific returns to regular respiration. During the subsequent emotion response accuracy or reaction times did not differ between breathing practices.

SAMP1, also known as Transmembrane Protein 201 (TMEM201), is an inner nuclear membrane protein. Its potential role in metabolic regulation, especially in hepatic glucose production, is entirely unexplored. This study aimed to investigate the function and mechanism of SAMP1 in regulating hepatic gluconeogenesis. Methods: The expression of SAMP1 was examined in the livers of diabetic (db/db) mice. Gain- and loss-of-function studies were conducted in vivo using hepatocyte-specific SAMP1 overexpression and knockdown mice delivered via AAV8 vectors, and in vitro in primary mouse hepatocytes using adenoviral vectors. Glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests were performed. Molecular mechanisms were probed using co-immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and pharmacological inhibition. Results: Hepatic SAMP1 expression was significantly upregulated in db/db mice. Forced overexpression of SAMP1 in hepatocytes enhanced gluconeogenic gene expression (Pck1, G6pc) and glucose output upon glucagon stimulation, and exacerbated hyperglycemia in mice. Conversely, genetic knockdown of SAMP1 attenuated gluconeogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, SAMP1 physically interacted with the catalytic subunit of PKA. This interaction facilitated the phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB, leading to the transcriptional activation of gluconeogenic genes. The pro-gluconeogenic effect of SAMP1 was abolished by the CREB phosphorylation inhibitor KG-501. Conclusions: Our findings identify the inner nuclear membrane protein SAMP1/TMEM201 as a novel critical enhancer of hepatic gluconeogenesis. It functions as a scaffold that interacts with PKA to potentiate the PKA/CREB signaling cascade. Targeting SAMP1 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for mitigating excessive hepatic glucose output in T2DM.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Work on the AnVIL platform can be easily shared to promote reproducible science and collaboration. The purpose of this study is to better understand the current user base of the AnVIL platform. The AnVIL Community Poll aimed to collect baseline information, identify development opportunities, guide the prioritization of user support strategies, and succinctly but comprehensively describe the current AnVIL Community. The AnVIL Team disseminated the inaugural AnVIL Community Poll by sharing it broadly on social media and through AnVIL and related consortia mailing lists. We categorized respondents as either returning or potential users of the AnVIL platform (based on their provided usage description) and examined user experiences: specifically user backgrounds, technological comfort, research interests, computational needs, and preferences for training and support. Our sample of the AnVIL community found opportunities for platform adoption beyond the current user base and identified areas where training should be enhanced, training preferences, and user computational needs. Specifically, while most respondents were involved in human genomics research, there may be potential for growth in adoption of the platform by prioritizing materials to support clinical researchers. All respondents felt availability of specific tools or datasets was a key feature of the platform. The broader community may also benefit from further development or showcasing of resources to facilitate cost management, finding and incorporating analysis tools, and data import. Our sample greatly preferred virtual training opportunities and returning users of the platform foresaw needing large amounts of storage. This poll provided an insightful snapshot of the current state of the AnVIL and demonstrated areas where the AnVIL Team can take specific steps to address barriers related to platform adoption and further support the existing and varied AnVIL Community.

Enzyme production is often the main bottleneck of the process, and proteins are frequently produced using the workhorse E. coli BL21(DE3) and its derivatives. However, other bacteria with beneficial characteristics can also be engineered for this purpose. Cupriavidus necator H16 (C. necator), for example, is a Gram-negative bacterium well-known for its lithoautotrophic metabolism and high polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) accumulation. Previous studies have demonstrated high-yield protein production without inclusion body formation, which is one of the main challenges when producing enzymes in E. coli. Nevertheless, high-yield protein production in C. necator remains an understudied field. Here, we optimized a T7 RNA polymerase genetic system to improve protein production in C. necator. We investigated the impact of codon usage, different inducible promoters, and several genetic elements by expressing the fluorescent reporter protein GFP. Codon usage was the main factor limiting protein production in C. necator. Tuning the RBS strength also strongly reduced leakiness of the promoter. As an application, we compared the performance of our engineered C. necator T7 RNA polymerase-based system to that of an E. coli-based T7 system using the ene-reductase YqjM from Bacillus subtilis. The optimized protein expression system in C. necator outperformed the gold standard, E. coli BL21(DE3), in producing soluble, FMN-loaded enzyme.

SRS67 and SRS20A, two such antigens, are hypothesized to be highly immunogenic. Here, we comprehensively evaluated their immunological properties and protective efficacy in mice. Recombinant SRS67 and SRS20A, produced via prokaryotic expression, induced high-titer, specific polyclonal antisera in BALB/c mice and rabbits. Western blotting confirmed these antisera recognized native RH strain tachyzoite antigens, validating strong immunogenicity. qPCR showed SRS67 transcription was higher in PRU (chronic) than RH (acute) strains, while SRS20A expression was comparable. Immunofluorescence, using GAP45 as a membrane marker, localized both proteins as puncta around RH tachyzoite membranes. In vitro phenotypic assays indicated that the corresponding polyclonal antibodies significantly inhibited the invasion of host cells by T. gondii and subsequent intracellular proliferation. Challenge studies demonstrated protective efficacy: in acute RH infection, immunized mice (single or combined antigens) showed 60% higher survival, with bivalent groups delaying mortality by 1-2 days. In chronic PRU infection, all immunized groups had >85% fewer brain cysts, and bivalents better attenuated neuropathology (e.g., meningeal thickening). Mechanistically, SRS67 upregulated Th1 cytokines (TNF-, IL-18) in acute infection, while both proteins downregulated IFN-{gamma} to limit immune-mediated damage; GSH upregulation indicated antioxidative involvement. In chronic infection, co-immunization synergistically enhanced SOD activity to counter oxidative stress, with IFN-{gamma} downregulation maintaining immune homeostasis. These findings support SRS67 and SRS20A as promising T. gondii vaccine candidates, acting via coordinated Th1 immunity and antioxidative pathways.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

To understand how the brain encodes the layout information, it is crucial to identify the key features of environmental layout and how they are processed in the human brain. The vector coding principle, which highlight the role of boundary distance and orientation, provides a theoretical framework supported by physiological evidence from rodents. In this study, we developed a reconstruction approach to quantitatively estimate 3D layout information from natural indoor scene images. This approach enabled analyses of fMRI data from the large-scale Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) using vector-based models of 3D layout. To validate the NSD-based results and examine task-related dynamics, we further conducted fMRI and MEG experiments with navigation-related and non-navigational tasks. Controlling for low-, mid-, and high-level visual and semantic features of natural indoor scenes, we found a spatiotemporal dissociation between boundary distance and orientation representations in the human brain. Relative distance was encoded in the early visual cortex during early processing in a task-invariant manner, whereas orientation was represented in scene-selective higher visual areas during later processing and was modulated by navigation-related tasks. Importantly, task modulation manifested as feedback-induced enhancement of orientation coding in the early visual cortex. Together, these findings provide a novel perspective on how the human brain represents navigation-relevant information about the immediate surrounding environment, advancing our understanding of the neural mechanisms that link perception to action in spatial navigation.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

To understand the underlying mechanisms of action selection in such contexts, we propose a computational model that extends stochastic optimal control theory through a novel framework for obstacle avoidance. The model decomposes action selection as a weighted combination of individual control policies, each generated for either target approach or obstacle avoidance. By integrating value information from goals, obstacles, and actions into a unified measure of \"relative desirability\", the model dynamically determines the contribution of each policy to the overall action selection process. We evaluated the framework using simulated target-reaching tasks in cluttered environments based on previous human studies. The results showed that the model captures key features of human motor behavior, including the influence of obstacle properties on movement trajectories and the transient tendency to initiate movements toward obstacles before avoidance.

P.", "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that the visual system anticipates upcoming visual input contingent on the execution of saccadic eye movements. In line with this idea, it has been shown that changes in visual input across saccades elicit stronger post-saccadic fixation-locked neural responses compared to no-change conditions; an effect known as the preview effect. In the present study, we demonstrate that this preview effect depends on active vision and cannot be explained by either classical or spatiotopic adaptation. In a gaze-contingent experiment, in which participants were cued to make saccades to object stimuli, we concurrently recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) and eye-tracking data. The source-localized MEG signal was deconvolved with stimulus onset and eye movement events in order to account for systematic variation in gaze behavior related to the no-change (valid preview) and change (invalid preview) conditions. Crucially, preview effects in the primary visual and in ventral-occipital cortices were markedly larger when participants made saccades compared to replay blocks in which we simulated the visual consequences of saccades absent saccade execution, demonstrating that the preview effect cannot be simply explained by classic adaptation. A further control condition ruled out spatiotopic adaptation. Our results show that early visual cortical areas which are not known to exhibit saccadic remapping neurons still show signs of sequential neural history effects across saccades. Previous research might have overlooked this influence of active vision because of the lack of an invalid preview condition which breaks the correspondence between pre-saccadic extrafoveal and post-saccadic foveal stimulation.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

In the mammalian host, T. brucei is present as replicative and non-replicative bloodstream forms (BSF) referred to as long slender and stumpy, respectively. In the insect vector, the developmental forms are procyclic (PCF), epimastigote, and metacyclic trypomastigote. It is well established that BSF use glucose as the main energy source, and PCF can use glucose but, in its absence, uses amino acids, mainly proline. Due to these facts, the metabolism of amino acids has been well studied in PCF, but less attention has been given to it in BSF. In the present work, we unveil the participation of glutamine (Gln), the most abundant amino acid in the human blood, in BSF proliferation. According to the data presented herein, in the absence of extracellular Gln, cell cycle progress, as well as kinetoplast and flagella distribution and function among daughter cells, are widely compromised, yielding polyploid multiflagellated cells with reduced motility. In addition, the Gln-poor medium resulted in cells with a massive alteration in the proteome glutamylation. These alterations were reverted when Gln was added to the culture media. An analysis of the glutamylproteome of cells incubated in Gln-poor medium, followed by a Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, suggested a relationship between glutamylation and biological processes such as gene expression and regulation, cell cycle, and bioenergetics metabolism, in addition to cytoskeleton dynamics in BSF of T. brucei.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

A simple and parsimonious solution assumes the first gene sequences evolved inside dividing protocells, which enables selection for functional sets. But these models of information maintenance do not consider how protocells acquired their genetic information in the first place. Clues to this transition are suggested by patterns in the genetic code, which indicate a strong link to autotrophic metabolism, with early translation based on direct physical interactions between amino acids and short RNA polymers, grounded in their hydrophobicity. Here, we develop a mathematical model to investigate how random RNA polymers inside autotrophically growing protocells could evolve better coding sequences for discrete functions. The model tracks a population of protocells that evolve towards two essential functions: CO2 fixation (which drives monomer synthesis and cell growth) and copying (which amplifies replication and translation of sequences inside protocells). The model shows that distinct coding sequences can emerge from random RNA sequences driving increased protocell division. The analysis reveals an important restriction: growth-supporting functions such as CO2 fixation must be more easily attained than informational processes such as RNA copying and translation. This uncovers a fundamental constraint on the emergence of genetic heredity: growth precedes information at the origin of life.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

AMH signals through a specific type II receptor (AMHRII) and a type I receptor to activate the downstream Smad1/5/9 signaling pathway. Interestingly, non-mammalian vertebrates, including teleosts, also express AMH despite lacking Mullerian ducts. Accumulating evidence indicates that AMH influences gonadal development and function across vertebrates. Intriguingly, zebrafish, a popular model organism, possesses AMH (Amh/amh) but lacks specific type II receptor (Amhr2). Based on our previous studies and data from others, we propose that Amh may signal through a novel pathway in zebrafish involving the BMP type II receptor Bmpr2a and type I receptor Bmpr1bb. In this study, we provide genetic and functional evidence for the existence of the Amh-Bmpr2a-Bmpr1bb signaling pathway in zebrafish and its role in controlling gonadal homeostasis. Our experimental data excluded the participation of Bmpr2b and Bmpr1ba, paralogues of Bmpr2a and Bmpr1bb respectively, in Amh signaling. Additionally, we also provide genetic evidence that the phenotypes exhibited by amh, bmpr2a, and bmpr1bb mutants, i.e., gonadal hypertrophy, were all dependent on gonadotropin signaling, and that the two gonadotropins (FSH and LH) showed similar potency in driving the development of hypertrophic gonadal growth resulting from dysfunction in the Amh-Bmpr2a-Bmpr1bb signaling pathway.

They demonstrated that tiny RNNs achieve superior predictive performance compared to classical cognitive models such as reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian inference models, and that dynamical systems analyses of the RNNs can reveal cognitive dynamics that differ from those assumed in the cognitive models. This framework is highly promising; however, we suggest allocating room for discussion as to whether the dynamics of RNNs purely reflect the cognitive processes at work in the individual's brain. In particular, RNNs may adapt to within-individual state changes (e.g., transitions between engaged and disengaged states) in ways not captured by cognitive models, thereby improving model fit without necessarily representing cognitive strategies per se. This raises the possibility that the dynamics of RNNs may include processes that deviate from, rather than directly reflect, individual cognitive strategies.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

However, such markers are typically used to measure long-term changes, such as the progression of disease over multiple days or months. In this theoretical study, we determine the maximum theoretical temporal resolution and precision - the ability to distinguish rapid changes in gene expression and to obtain the true frequency of such changes, respectively. As a model of such processes, we used Released Markers of Activity (RMAs) - a class of synthetic serum markers that are expressed in neurons in the brain but transported into the blood. RMAs are orthogonal to physiological processes and have tunable levels, production rate, and onset time, providing well-defined data for serum marker production, tissue transport, and detection. We explore several scenarios where RMAs were used, including monitoring tissue transduction, changes in endogenous gene expression, and drug-induced marker expression. We demonstrate that the temporal resolution of monitoring primarily depends on the extrinsic noise level of the RMA signal and protein serum half-life. Additionally, we find that decreasing the serum half-life results in improved temporal precision at the cost of signal intensity.

Two competing hypotheses explain how the brain solves this challenge: the integration hypothesis, where tactile signals are transformed into spatial coordinates by integrating touch and posture information; and the cueing hypothesis, where touch merely cues a location on the body whose position is specified via proprioception. Adjudicating between these hypotheses is nearly impossible without modeling the latent factors underlying somatosensory spatial perception. We fill this gap in the present study. We first formalized each hypothesis from a Bayesian perspective: If touch merely triggers proprioceptive localization (cueing hypothesis), tactile and proprioceptive localization should rely on the same Bayesian computations, with identical prior expectations about the mosquito's spatial location; If they involve distinct Bayesian computational processes (integration hypothesis), distinct prior expectations may shape tactile and proprioceptive localization. To test these predictions, we had nineteen participants localize either proprioceptive or tactile targets on their fingertips. We then fit their data with several Bayesian models of each hypothesis. Models allowing different prior distributions between modalities provided the best fit for most participants, with 17 out of 19 participants showing significantly different prior distributions across modalities. These provide strong computational evidence that tactile and proprioceptive localization rely on distinct computational mechanisms, a conclusion that has important implications for how we understand these everyday behaviors and their neural mechanisms.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

For this, we used double-transgenic zebrafish larvae expressing cell-type-specific fluorescent proteins and GCaMP6f, combined with immunostaining and selective-plane illumination microscopy to monitor spontaneous neuronal activity and neurotransmitter identity. We found that neural activity approached criticality at balanced E-I ratios but became disordered when E-I ratios were imbalanced. A stochastic network model operating at a critical point, where excitation and inhibition couplings are balanced and balanced amplification drives network avalanches, successfully reproduced the observed statistics of neuronal avalanches and their dependence on E-I ratio fluctuations.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Here we developed humanised zebrafish in which we restricted TDP-43 to the cytoplasm of either neurons or oligodendrocytes. Cytoplasmic TDP-43 restricted to neurons led to a severe axonopathy, with extreme distal axonal swelling and reduced myelination. Axonopathy was mirrored by cell type specific loss of TDP-43 function from neurons, pointing to loss of function, rather than a toxic gain of function of mislocalised TDP-43, as driving this phenotype. Preventing oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination when TDP-43 was mislocalised in neurons exacerbated axonopathy, indicating that oligodendrocytes limit neurodegeneration. Indeed, when TDP-43 was mislocalised to the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes this also led to axonopathy and reduced myelination, pointing to complex contributions of neurons and oligodendrocytes to neurodegeneration.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

We analyzed 11 longitudinal KPC-3 carbapenemase-producing, ST258 K. pneumoniae isolates collected over ~4 years from an immunocompromised patient with chronic colonization and recurrent infections. After ~3.3 years, isolates developed ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA)-resistance with restored carbapenem susceptibility, coinciding with emergence of a V76G substitution in a highly-conserved motif in the core of MutH endonuclease. Compared with earlier isolates, mutHV76G-carrying isolates showed greater within-host genomic diversification (69-179 vs. 2-12 SNP differences) and acquired blaKPC-3L169P, encoding an KPC {Omega}-loop substitution that mediates CZA resistance and re-establishes carbapenem susceptibility. mutHV76G isolates exhibited stepwise increases in meropenem-vaborbactam (MVB) and cefiderocol minimum inhibitory concentrations, plausibly linked to substitutions in KPC, OmpK36 porin, CirA iron transporter and/or EnvZ kinase. Clinical mutHV76G isolates and CRISPR-engineered mutHV76G mutants were hypermutators based on rifampin mutational frequencies. Using isogenic mutant and parent strains, we confirmed that mutHV76G accelerated evolution of CZA and MVB resistance in vitro and in vivo, promoted transfer and uptake of resistance plasmids, and improved bacterial fitness during mouse infections. Resistance evolution in mice recapitulated clinical trajectories, with blaKPC-3 and ompK36 mutations emerging under CZA and MVB exposure, respectively. Phenotypes of mutHV76G and mutH-null strains were comparable, indicating that the V76G substitution largely abrogates MutH function.

T.", "abstract": "Healthy plant leaves host both commensal bacteria, which usually do not cause harm, and opportunistic pathogens, which under the right circumstances can cause disease. Microbial and plant-derived factors can potentially govern the balance between commensals and pathogens; understanding this dynamic is crucial for developing effective biocontrol strategies. In Arabidopsis thaliana, isothiocyanates (ITCs) are toxic defense metabolites that suppress most bacteria. An important virulence factor for bacterial and fungal pathogens of A. thaliana is the ITC hydrolase SaxA, which detoxifies ITCs. To investigate microbial interactions based on SaxA-mediated ITC degradation, we used five ITC-sensitive bacterial commensals and the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas viridiflava 3D9 (PS). All strains were isolated from healthy A. thaliana leaves and PS degrades 4-methylsulfinylbutyl-ITC (4MSOB-ITC) with SaxA. We examined their growth in the presence of 4MSOB-ITC, both in monoculture and in coculture with PS or a saxA-deficient mutant (PSKO). Based on experimental growth data, we developed a generalizable consumer-resource mathematical model incorporating ITC toxicity, ITC degradation, and nutrient use. We predicted conditions and confirmed them experimentally under which SaxA not only benefits the pathogen but also indirectly favors commensal growth, which then can limit pathogen proliferation by competing for nutrients. In addition, we tested in silico how commensal ITC susceptibility, pathogen ITC degradation rates, and growth parameters affect the trade-off between SaxA-mediated virulence (strong pathogen growth) and high commensal rescue (commensal growth). Our findings suggest that the effects of microbial traits - traditionally viewed as either virulence or plant-beneficial factors - are context-dependent. This underscores the need to reconsider how such traits are classified in the context of plant-microbiome interactions.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

The invasive redlegged earth mite, Halotydeus destructor, is a major pest of grain and pasture crops in Australia and is increasingly developing resistance to broad-spectrum pesticides. Here, we assembled a chromosomal-level genome of H. destructor, which comprises eight chromosomes totalling 46 Mb. We also compiled a rich genomic dataset of 190 H. destructor populations (whole-genome pooled sequencing) collected across its invasive Australian range (thousands of kilometers), in four years (2018, 2021, 2022, and 2023), and generated resistance phenotypes to multiple pesticide compounds widely used to manage this pest. These genomic resources were used to provide the most detailed characterisation of genetic structure in Australia to date, highlighting complex patterns of regional structuring and isolation-by-distance. We then screened this population genomic dataset to identify target-site mutations in the ace (acetylcholinesterase) and para (voltage-gated sodium channel) genes, which are the targets of organophosphate and pyrethroid pesticides, respectively. Genotype-phenotype associations suggest that the ace G119S mutation has a strong contribution to chlorpyrifos resistance, but not omethoate resistance. Association tests also suggest that para L1024F mutation has a strong, but weakening, contribution to pyrethroid resistance. We then developed and validated a Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) assay for the ace G1195S and para L1024F mutations linked to chlorpyrifos and bifenthrin resistance, respectively, and demonstrate how these assays can be applied to quantify allele frequencies in pooled DNA extractions. The KASP markers that we have developed will be valuable in facilitating rapid spatiotemporal screening of key resistance mutations in target genes. Our work also suggests a non-target gene basis for omethoate resistance, and a potential shift to other non-target gene mechanisms for pyrethroid resistance. To that end, our new chromosome-level assembly will be important for characterising the genetic architecture of those resistances.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we demonstrate that activation of the borate transporter NaBC1 enhances myoblast adhesion and polarization by modulating integrin expression and actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Using C2C12 myoblasts cultured on fibronectin-functionalized substrates, we show that NaBC1 stimulation induces the formation of more and larger focal adhesions, promotes early cell spreading, and reduces retrograde actin flow, indicative of molecular clutch engagement. This enhanced adhesive state is accompanied by the transcriptional and protein-level upregulation of fibronectin-binding integrins (5{beta}1, v{beta}3), and by their spatial colocalization with NaBC1 at the cell membrane. Furthermore, FITC-labelled boron accumulates in focal adhesions and intracellular compartments such as mitochondria, lysosomes, and the ER, suggesting a role for boron in both adhesion and subcellular signaling. These effects are fibronectin-specific and are abrogated in cells exposed to mutant fibronectins and laminin-111 (unable to activate the molecular clutch). Altogether, our results identify the boron transporter NaBC1 as a modulator of myoblast adhesion and mechanotransduction acting in close cooperation with fibronectin-binding integrins.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Extant land plants comprise two major groups, tracheophytes and bryophytes, which include liverworts, hornworts and mosses. These two groups diverged early after land colonization, and thus, immune mechanisms have also been subjected to independent evolution. Here, we investigated the function of the unique NPR in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha and report that it exhibits a specialised immune function relative to its orthologs in tracheophytes. We show that MpNPR modulates the formation of oil bodies, a synapomorphy of liverworts, which function as storage organelles for secondary metabolites and defence against arthropods. We found that MpNPR interacts with MpERF13, a transcription factor controlling oil body differentiation, and that plants with altered levels of MpNPR are misregulated in the expression of MpERF13-dependent genes. Furthermore, we uncover that MpNPR and MpERF13 are required for the defence against snail herbivory. Finally, we show that the ability of MpNPR to induce oil body formation and resistance to gastropods is fully dependent on MpERF13.

We used a fruit fly model of PRKN-dependent PD associated with defects in mitophagy, a mitochondrial quality control pathway, to test this hypothesis. We found that ingestion of MNPs at concentrations tolerated by wild-type controls selectively enhanced PD-relevant phenotypes - including progressive dopaminergic neurodegeneration, movement defects, and sleep disruption - in this model of PD.

A major barrier to EV characterization is the difficulty of vesicle isolation, procedures are often lengthy, yield is low, and specialized equipment is required.

This application is banned nowadays, due to increased risk of antibiotic resistance. In piglets this results in a higher prevalence of post-weaning diarrhoea, deteriorating both animal health and performance. Our goal was to find a metabolite signature separating piglets with low faecal consistency score (FCS) from piglets with normal faecal consistency and determine which pathways were enriched in this signature. By using direct infusion mass spectrometry on blood spots, we built machine learning (ML) models that aimed to differentiate between low and normal FCS. To test the general predictive capability of these models, we applied a Leave-One-Country-Out (LOCO) strategy for cross validation. Our second approach after LOCO was finding the optimal number of features to include in a feature-reduced model. To determine the order in which features were to be eliminated, we ranked them based on a combination of t-test and fold-change significance scores. Enrichment analysis using mummichog was used to gain insights into the final signature set of m/z values found using this ranking and ML models. Models trained both using all countries and leaving out specific countries from training showed a limited ability to predict FCS category. Furthermore, the LOCO results were mixed, with some countries showing a predictive signal present in the data, but others with predictive capability that was no better than random. Signature analysis using t-test and fold-change results did not result in any KEGG pathways that were enriched in this signature as compared to random. Using these methods, we could predict the FCS category to a limited degree. Although no common signature for low faecal consistency could be determined using this method, given that some countries showed more reliable LOCO results, further analysis into specifically the samples from those countries could be a valuable next step.

A key immunogenic antigen, the phosphatase PhoN, is metabolically essential for bacterial survival in the vitamin B6-depleted tumour microenvironment and thus cannot be simply deleted. While conventional deimmunisation targets surface residues, we present a strategy of allosteric deimmunisation by mutating non-surface, buried residues within the dominant h2 helix T-cell epitope. We hypothesised that the epitope is allosterically coupled to the distal active site gate, allowing for the simultaneous modulation of immunogenicity and enzymatic function. Using a computational pipeline, we designed variants and used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to predict their functional effects. The simulations revealed that mutations in the h2 helix allosterically controlled the gate's flexibility. The enzymatic activities of the deimmunized variants were correlated with the MD predictions: two of the five variants exhibited a 4-fold increase in catalytic function.

How sensory processing during wakefulness contributes to making an organism tired at night, however, remains elusive. Here, we investigate the role of excitatory helicon cells in Drosophila (ExR1), a distinct neural population dedicated to processing sensory information. Using combined optogenetics and voltage imaging, we show that helicon cells excite sleep-promoting R3m ring neurons and trigger a subsequent autoinhibition of R3m via voltage- and Ca2+-gated K+ channels such as Slowpoke. Investigating the flies' sleep patterns, we found that blocking synaptic output from helicon as well as RNAi-mediated knockdown of Slowpoke in R3m reduces sleep quality and leads to loss of nocturnal sleep, indicating that sleep need is generated via this route. Further, we show that excitation of R3m induces feedback inhibition of helicon cells via ionotropic GABA receptors. Knockdown of the ionotropic GABA receptor subunit Rdl in helicon cells increases sleep latency and causes sleep loss at the beginning of the night. We show that inhibition via Rdl facilitates nocturnal slow-wave activity which forms a sensory filter and prevents sleep disruption through auditory stimuli. We therefore uncover an inhibitory feedback circuit, in which neurons processing sensory information directly activate sleep promoting neurons to generate sleep need. At night, this sleep need is then converted into actual sleep, facilitated by the formation of a neural filter that stabilizes sleep/wake transition.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Identifying important regeneration-associated lncRNAs may allow for cross-species applications, improving tissue repair in other organisms. However, few studies and a lack of functional validation complicate our understanding of their mechanistic functions. This research explores novel lncRNAs associated with caudal fin regeneration and positional memory, aiming to identify those that are evolutionarily important across species and may hold universal significance. RNA-seq data deposited in the NCBI database were compared at various important time points (0h post-amputation (hpa), 12 hpa, 1 day post-amputation (dpa), two dpa, three dpa, and seven dpa) and fin parts (proximal, middle, and distal) to uncover major regulatory lncRNAs. Using HISAT2, StringTie, FEELnc, Conservation Analysis, and WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis), we found 107 lncRNAs related to regeneration time points and 229 about positional memory during regeneration. Overlapping analysis identified 13 common genomic regions that are complete or partial lncRNAs, indicating a functional connection between regeneration and positional identity and expressed differently in each time point and each position. Additionally, a comparison with regeneration-associated mRNAs revealed that these 13 regions play critical roles in both processes, providing insights into the molecular mechanisms of regenerative precision. Following validation by RT-PCR, the results further suggest that these overlapping regions are differentially expressed across distinct positions within the same tissue, despite a consistent injury pattern. This positional variation in expression may indicate potential roles in both evolutionary adaptation and the regulation of regenerative processes across multiple tissues.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Here, we introduce Protein Synthesis Profiling (PSP), a proximity-labeling strategy for transcriptome-wide identification of actively translated mRNAs without ribosome isolation. PSP exploits a fusion of the enzyme APEX2 with the elongation factor eEF2, which transiently associates with ribosomes during elongation, to catalyze selective tagging of mRNAs engaged in translation. Applied in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, PSP captures condition-specific translational programs, recapitulates known stress responses, and expands the detectable repertoire of regulated genes beyond existing methods.

Using the emerging dynamical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (D-NEMD) simulations approach, we investigated how biologically relevant pH shifts affect the functional dynamics of the fully glycosylated spike from the ancestral, Delta, and Omicron BA.1 variants of concern. For this, over 1100 nonequilibrium simulations were conducted to capture the pH-induced structural and dynamic changes that occur following transitions from physiological to acidic and alkaline conditions, with the former mimicking the low pH environment within endosomes, and the latter the high pH conditions accessible to nascent exhaled aerosols. D-NEMD reveals that pH changes trigger distinct, variant-specific conformational responses in key regions of the spike, including the receptor binding domain (RBD), fusion peptide proximal region (FPPR), and C-terminal domain (CTD). The ancestral spike shows broad pH sensitivity, characterised by directional motions and region-specific structural rearrangements that depend on the pH conditions. The spike of the Delta variant displays increased reactivity to alkaline pH, potentially explaining its reduced stability in alkaline aerosols. The spike of Omicron BA.1, in contrast, responds strongly to acidic conditions with spontaneous RBD opening and pronounced structural rearrangements in the FPPR and CTD. This behaviour aligns with this variant's preference for endosomal entry and reduced reliance on TMPRSS2-mediated fusion. The Omicron BA.1 spike also shows increased resilience to alkaline pH, suggesting greater environmental stability. Our findings further emphasise the key role of glycans in spike activation, with glycan N234 stabilising the RBD up conformation during pH-induced transitions in Omicron under acidic conditions. These insights, together, highlight pH as a potential evolutionary pressure for SARS-CoV-2 and underscore the importance of glycosylation and environmental pH variability in shaping the behaviour of viral fusion proteins.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Biosensor-mediated control of metabolic pathways has been proposed as a strategy to improve the performance of those bioprocesses. By linking industrial biosynthetic pathways to measurable metabolites through biochemical transformations, a highly interconnected regulatory design space is unveiled, offering new opportunities for pathway dynamic control. Yet, a systematic approach for selecting and implementing genetic circuits within such large space has remained absent. Here, we introduce BiosInt, an allosteric transcription factor-based genetic biocircuit, with quasi-integral adaptation control capabilities that can be used to increase robustness and performance of biomanufacturing engineered strains. To test the capabilities of the circuit, we have analysed its performance for the full set of metabolic pathway topologies found in the bio-based chemical production space of compounds with industrial interest. For a given implementation of the BiosInt circuit, we carried out a multiobjective optimization process that provides the inverse control solution of optimal topology starting from any given pathway configuration and enzyme expression ratios. Next, synthetic datasets are generated to train machine learning-based predictive models with the data obtained from the simulations of each topology by varying enzyme expression levels and their corresponding concentrations. We validated the models by showing their ability to predict the best control topology for a given set of enzyme ratios. As a proof-of-concept, we show its application to the design of the genetic constructs expressing flavonoid production pathways, providing optimal performance for the BiosInt-mediated dynamic regulation.

Disrupting early thalamic activity alters both cortical activity and the expression of a subset of these genes, demonstrating a causal role for thalamic input in sensory modality acquisition.

Curvature extrema often coincide with points of high information content (surprisal, in information-theoretic terms). However, this relationship is only correlational. To date, no study has directly compared the role of curvature extrema with the role of surprisal itself. Does the visual system selectively encode curvature extrema because they tend to be informative-because they are heuristic proxies for high-surprisal points along the contour-or does it directly encode informative points that happen often to be located at curvature extrema? We addressed this question in a series of shape-matching experiments, testing how curvature extrema and information content contribute to recognition. Observers (N = 7) matched a smooth test shape to one of two re-scaled shapes (target and distractor) constructed by connecting, with straight lines, points corresponding to (i) curvature maxima, (ii) both curvature maxima and minima, or (iii) points of maximum surprisal. A baseline condition used identical test and target shapes. Stimuli included artificial shapes composed of compound radial frequency patterns and natural shapes (animal outlines), the latter enabling us to disentangle curvature and information effects by restricting sampled points. Recognition performance was higher for natural than artificial shapes (95% vs. ~86%). Performance for shapes containing a few points of high information matched performance on trials containing all curvature extrema and baseline trials. It also exceeded performance for shapes with curvature maxima alone (65% vs. ~90%).

Several conserved elements in the orthoflavivirus 3' untranslated region (UTR) are responsible for XrnI-resistance, named xrRNA. The ubiquitous prevalence of xrRNA/sfRNA in flaviviruses indicate an important role of these structures in the viral life cycle, although their function is not completely understood.

In vitro RNA degradation assays showed that xrRNA1 efficiently stalled human or mosquito Xrn1 independent of xrRNA2 integrity.

P. aeruginosa uses several mechanisms to manage oxidative stress, including superoxide dismutases to detoxify the superoxide radical, catalases to break down H2O2, and members of the ferritin superfamily to store iron. The iron-responsive PrrF1 and PrrF2 small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) are predicted to pair with and destabilize mRNA transcripts for several oxidative stress response proteins, including sodB, katA, and brnD, encoding a novel bacterioferritin-like Dps protein. In this study, we developed brnD reporter constructs that are responsive to PrrF-mediated iron regulation. We demonstrated that PrrF-mediated regulation of brnD occurs in the 5? untranslated region (UTR) of its mRNA, likely via a conserved region of complementarity with the PrrF sRNAs. We further demonstrated that brnD mRNA levels are increased upon hydrogen peroxide treatment. Surprisingly, peroxide treatment also resulted in elevated levels of the PrrF sRNAs, and this induction occurred specifically at the prrF2 promoter. Lastly, we investigated these regulatory effects in Pseudomonas fluorescens, revealing similar iron regulation of PrrF sRNAs and the brnD ortholog, as well as peroxide-induced expression of the PrrF sRNAs.

Despite intensive recent research on colibactin and its involvement in tumorigenesis, the evolutionary dynamics related to its production remain poorly characterised. We map evolution of colibactin production in E. coli using a large collection of high-resolution genomes and show that its introduction via a mobile element has induced multiple plasmid-mediated acquisitions of previously unrecognised colibactin immunity genes in non-producing multi-drug resistant lineages. Our study suggests that in E. coli, multi-drug resistance is incompatible with colibactin production due to the unbearable combined fitness costs, supported by colibactin-producing phenotypes remaining susceptible to most classes of antibiotics and thriving in regions with low antimicrobial usage. Consequently, resistant lineages circulating in these regions are under selective pressure to acquire colibactin immunity to compete with the endemic colibactin-producing bacteria during colonisation. Conversely, high antimicrobial usage selects for a colibactin susceptible antimicrobial resistant phenotype as it drives the colibactin-producing E. coli towards extinction.

This is particularly true for Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Gc), the causative agent of gonorrhea, which lacks effector-injecting secretion systems or toxins. Gc infection triggers a rapid influx of neutrophils (PMNs) that typically kill bacteria through multiple mechanisms, including a potent oxidative burst. Despite this, Gc exhibits remarkable resistance to reactive oxygen species and readily replicates in the presence of PMNs, which is in part due to the consumption of PMN-derived lactate. Previous studies demonstrated that the lactate permease, LctP, is required for oxidative stress resistance in Gc and host colonization in a murine model of gonorrhea, suggesting that lactate utilization contributes to virulence. Gc encodes four lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs) with distinct regulation and mechanisms, including two L-LDHs, LldD and LutACB. Although either enzyme alone supports L-lactate utilization, we found that both are required for full fitness during co-colonization with PMNs, indicating some non-redundant roles.

They are isolated from Cystobacter sp. Cbv34 and contain various alkoxy groups on para-aminobenzoic acid moieties, which are believed to play a crucial role in antibacterial functions. The alkoxy groups are generated by iterative methylations on a methoxy group by the cobalamin (Cbl)-dependent radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) enzyme CysS. CysS catalyzes up to three methylations to give ethoxy, isopropoxy, sec-butoxy, and tert-butoxy groups. For each methylation, CysS uses a ping-pong mechanism in which two molecules of SAM are consumed. One SAM is used to methylate cob(I)alamin, while another generates a 5-deoxyadenosyl 5-radical to initiate substrate methylation. However, little is known about how the enzyme promotes both Cbl methylation and iterative substrate methylation, which occur by polar SN2 and radical processes, respectively. Here, we report three X-ray crystal structures of a homolog of CysS from Corallococcus sp. CA054B. Two were determined in the presence of methoxy- and ethoxy-containing substrates, showing how CysS accommodates substrates and products during iterative methylation. The third structure, determined in the absence of a substrate, exhibits structural changes that reorient the conformation of SAM to allow for the methylation of cob(I)alamin.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

S.; Fetter, R. L.; Song, B.; White, F. M.; Lazzara, M.; Thevenin, D.", "abstract": "Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) are key regulators of cell signaling. However, their study and therapeutic targeting have been limited by the lack of known natural ligands or selective agonists, as well as an incomplete understanding of their structure-function relationships. Nonetheless, receptor homodimerization has been shown to suppress RPTP catalytic activity by restricting substrate access, offering a promising strategy for examining and modulating their function. Our previous work on PTPRJ, a member of the RPTP family, showed that its transmembrane domain regulates homodimerization, thereby controlling access to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) substrates and their phosphorylation levels. We also developed peptides that disrupt this dimerization, thereby inhibiting RTK phosphorylation and reducing cancer cell migration. These peptides were then engineered for selective, pH-sensitive insertion into the acidic tumor microenvironment to enhance efficacy while limiting off-target effects. Yet how broadly PTPRJ activation reshapes the phosphotyrosine landscape and whether those changes yield coherent cellular phenotypes remains unclear. In this study, we employed tyrosine phosphoproteomics, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and functional assays to assess the global impact of our lead peptide candidate, Hybrid 7, in A549 lung cancer cells that endogenously express PTPRJ. We find that Hybrid 7 decreases EGFR phosphorylation and selectively reduces phosphorylation across additional RTKs and motility adaptors, producing strong inhibition of EGF-driven migration and reduced proliferation. Hybrid 7 also elevates reactive oxygen species and DNA damage, and enforces CDK1-dependent G2/M arrest, indicating a primarily cytostatic, checkpoint-mediated response. These findings highlight the potential of RPTP-targeting peptides as valuable tools for dissecting RPTP function and as possible therapeutic agents capable of modulating key oncogenic pathways and inhibiting cancer progression.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

L.", "abstract": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, with over 100 identified downstream targets throughout the cell. In response to cellular stress, including energetic stress, AMPK is activated via binding of AMP and phosphorylation by upstream kinases, including liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CaMKK2). We and others have found that the activation of AMPK in response to cellular stress has distinct subcellular mechanisms, indicating compartmentalized regulation of AMPK signaling. Although oxidative stress is known to stimulate AMPK activity, how AMPK is spatially regulated by oxidative stress is underexplored. Using a single-fluorophore excitation-ratiometric AMPK activity reporter (ExRai AMPKAR), we find that oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) results in AMPK activity with distinct spatiotemporal dynamics. We found that across all locations measured, phosphorylation of AMPK by LKB1 is required for AMPK activity. Using a multi-omics approach, we discover that in response to oxidative stress, AMPK mediates significant metabolic and gene expression changes. These findings support a role for AMPK in regulating adaptive responses to oxidative stress. Altogether, this work provides new insights into how the subcellular environment influences localized AMPK activity, and identifies how AMPK regulates the cellular response to oxidative stress.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

MAP9 knockdown abolishes the outgrowth of neurites, a phenotype not observed through the loss of other neuronal MAPs. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that, unlike other MAPs that bind along protofilaments, MAP9 binds around the microtubule as a long alpha helix using five consecutive repeats. This unique binding mode enables MAP9 to staple adjacent protofilaments, thereby preventing microtubule depolymerization. We also showed that MAP9 selectively permits kinesin-3 motility while hindering kinesin-1 through interactions with a divergent loop-8 of their motor domains. Our results establish MAP9 as a key MAP required for neuronal growth and uncover how it differentially regulates intracellular transport driven by kinesin motors.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

By incorporating three in-phase A-tracts into each duplex arm, we created a GDNA construct with bent duplexes and examined the LC phases they form using temperature-resolved synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering and polarizing optical microscopy. Like the analogous constructs containing straight (rod-like) duplexes, the bent constructs exhibit a transition from bi-layer smectic-B phase to a monolayer smectic-A phase, although at ~30 {degrees}C lower temperatures. By comparing the monolayer spacing between the bent and straight constructs, we estimate a bending angle of ~11{degrees} per A-tract at room temperature and at physiologically relevant salt and cDNA. The bending angle decreases with increasing DNA concentration and temperature. Moreover, we demonstrate that divalent cations enhance the stability of the smectic-B phase up to ~30 mM Mg2+ but reduce it beyond that. The reduced thermal stabilities of the bilayer and in-layer ordering of bent duplexes imply reduced propensity for DNA condensation and heterochromatin formation under physiological conditions.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

To investigate epithelial intrinsic alterations associated with UC, we performed single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) multiomics on human primary colonic epithelial cells (colonoids) from healthy donors and patients with inactive or active UC. Colonoids were cultured in a 3D matrix recapitulating crypt base cells or grown as 2D monolayers in differentiation medium to recapitulate luminal epithelial cells. Colonoids from active UC had a unique cell population with elevated CTNNB1 and reduced APC expression. Chromatin profiling identified enrichment of RUNX2 motifs in this UC-associated cell population. Active UC colonoids exhibited reduced OLFM4 expression in 3D and the differentiation marker VIL1 in 2D, suggesting impaired self-renewal and maturation. RUNX2 inhibition using CADD522 reduced {beta}-catenin levels in 3D colonoids and restored VIL1 expression and junctional {beta}-catenin localization in 2D cultures.

Pre-Omicron strains broadly suppressed antiviral interferon-stimulated gene expression and reprogrammed metabolism by reducing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and {beta}-oxidation. Delta infection was associated with extensive transcriptional and metabolic remodelling, characterised by activation of stress- and growth-related kinases and selective retention of biosynthetic amino acids, consistent with a host response to stress and viral modulation of interferon-associated signalling.

Hearing loss is increasingly recognized as both an early marker of neural degeneration and a modifiable risk factor for dementia. Yet many adults report difficulty understanding speech in noise despite normal audiograms, highlighting the limitations of current clinical tests that fail to capture the underlying physiology or effort required for real-world listening. Beyond hearing thresholds, speech comprehension in complex environments depends on precise neural encoding of temporal fine structure (TFS) cues that convey pitch and spatial information. Here, we use a noninvasive EEG-based measure of neural phase-locking (frequency modulation following responses or FMFRs) to quantify TFS encoding in young and middle-aged adults with normal hearing thresholds. Middle-aged listeners exhibited reduced FMFR amplitudes and shallower discriminability slopes, reflecting diminished neural synchrony despite preserved hearing thresholds. Using a multi-talker speech task we further found that pupil-indexed listening effort was significantly greater in middle-aged adults despite matched accuracy across groups. Further, increases in listening effort were predicted by decreases in TFS encoding. Together, these results reveal that degraded neural encoding of TFS underlies subclinical listening difficulties and increased cognitive load, establishing the FMFR as a sensitive biomarker of hidden auditory neural decline.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Exposure to bacteriophages that use T4P as their primary receptor can select for resistance mutations that reduce or abolish pilus expression.

Here, we evaluated the repertoire of mutations in P. aeruginosa PAO1 exposed to the pilus-specific lytic phage PO4 and their ability to revert after removal of phage. Resistant isolates ranged from hyperpiliated to bald, but none retained twitching motility. We focused on isolates that still expressed surface pili, including one with an internal 4-amino acid duplication in the essential prepilin peptidase/methyltransferase, PilD. This duplication, distal to the predicted active sites, delayed prepilin processing. Accumulation of unprocessed subunits suppressed expression of new prepilins via inhibition of PilSR two-component system activity, restricting availability of functional subunits and conferring phage resistance. Introduction of a PilS point mutation that makes cells insensitive to accumulation of unprocessed pilins restored motility and phage susceptibility. Of the mutants tested, only those with a duplication in pilD recovered wild-type motility following removal of phage pressure, likely through slip-strand mispairing as a codon-modified variant did not revert. This work shows that resistance to pilus-specific phages does not require loss of pilus expression, and certain mutations can allow bacteria to regain pilus function.

We monitored viral replication dynamics and host transcriptional responses under both simultaneous and sequential infection conditions. Our results reveal complex, asymmetric interactions strongly influenced by infection timing and sequence. IAV exerted a pronounced inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2, mediated mainly by a robust type III interferon response.

Transcriptomic profiling identified coinfection-specific gene expression signatures enriched for metabolic and cell death pathways. In IAV-RSV coinfections, IAV generally suppressed RSV replication; strikingly, prior RSV infection significantly enhanced subsequent IAV replication, potentially through RSV-induced cellular remodeling or syncytia formation. Overall, host responses to coinfection were integrated and non-additive, with distinct transcriptional programs suggesting activation of unique cellular pathways beyond canonical antiviral responses. Together, these findings highlight the pivotal role of innate immunity and the order of infection in determining the outcome of respiratory viral coinfections, providing mechanistic insights with implications for clinical management and epidemic modeling.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

However, their potential synergistic effects are poorly understood, especially during the Polar Night when marine species are particularly vulnerable to stressors. Here, we tested our novel Stressed Overwintering Bottleneck Hypothesis (SOBH): warming will disrupt the overwintering of the keystone pan-Arctic copepod Calanus glacialis, a pivotal secondary producer, by impairing fitness-related traits underpinning survival and reproduction. We exposed C. glacialis to current and projected future OW levels (0 degree C and 4 degree C) and OA levels (pH 8.0 and 7.4-7.3) for 53 days during the mid-Arctic Polar Night. We assessed survival, development, and physiological and molecular mechanisms (oxygen consumption, lipid depletion, the expression of nine targeted genes related to oxidative stress and damage repair, and DNA damage). OW alone did not affect C. glacialis mortality; however, OA increased copepod survival at 0 degree C. Notably, their combined effects (OWA) synergistically doubled mortality, as predicted by SOBH. Warming also accelerated moulting from copepodite stage V to adulthood in December, and increased respiration, exhausted lipid reserves entirely by early March, approximately one to four months before the spring algal bloom, further supporting SOBH. DNA damage and gene expression patterns indicated low investment in maintenance and damage repair. Collectively, these findings reveal hidden mechanisms by which OW and OA synergistically threaten overwintering Calanus copepods by drastically increasing mortality, accelerating moulting, raising metabolic rates, and causing early lipid depletion. These effects generate cross-seasonal phenological mismatches among overwintering survival, energy reserves, reproduction, and primary production. Such stressed overwintering bottlenecks in foundational secondary producers like Calanus copepods provide novel explanations for how OW and OA can constrict Arctic marine food webs. At a broader perspective, SOBH highlights how multiple stressors induced overwintering disruption could reshape pan-Arctic and global biodiversity", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Genotype imputation from very low-density (LD) SNP panels of just a few hundred markers to high-density (HD) SNP panels has become a promising strategy to reduce the cost of genotyping while maintaining accurate genomic prediction. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of the makeup of HD-genotyped reference populations on i) the accuracy of imputation for LD-genotyped individuals and ii) the accuracy of genomic prediction for three traits of importance in Atlantic salmon production: growth, resistance to cardiomyopathy syndrome and resistance to pancreas disease. An Atlantic salmon population genotyped with a 47K SNP array was used for the study, along with an in silico LD panel of 554 SNPs. Five reference population scenarios for imputation were tested, which could include only the parents of the candidates for selection, a combination of parents and candidates, or just candidates. All scenarios resulted in highly accurate imputation rates (over 80%) except when the HD reference population was only composed of selection candidates. Nonetheless, the accuracy of imputation barely had an impact on the accuracy of genomic prediction, as the imputed datasets performed very similarly to the HD-panel. Adding a proportion of the offspring to the reference population, in addition to the parents, did not result in any benefit in terms of genomic prediction. Imputation is a cost-effective and robust option for genomic selection in aquaculture.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

In this context, we have conducted method optimizations at three levels. First, we benchmarked three distinct workflows compatible with the nanoElute2 platform using different sample collection/preparation plate supports (EVO96 oil-free, LF48 oil-based and LF48 oil-free, a streamlined automated sample resuspension and direct injection protocol). Then, we compared the optimized EVO96 workflow on nanoElute2 with EVOSEP-based separations operating at two analytical throughputs (80 and 120 samples per day). Subsequently, we evaluated digestion efficiency using a range of enzyme/protein ratios (1:1; 10:1; 20:1; 50:1) to maximize peptide recovery. Finally, the chromatographic setup was refined to determine the best compromise between throughput and robustness. Altogether, these optimizations allowed to establish a robust workflow quantifying up to 5,000 proteins in 10min gradient time per single Hela cell at a 55 samples-per-day throughput.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether hip abductor vibration can elicit mediolateral sway at frequencies <1 Hz, which dominate standing posture. Secondarily, we quantified the effects of mediolateral surface translations in this frequency range. Participants (n=12) without neurological or orthopedic conditions completed a series of standing trials in which we quantified center of pressure motion. In a subset of trials, time-varying hip abductor vibration was delivered, with vibration intensity following sum-of-sine trajectories with frequency content from 0.1-0.9 Hz. In other trials, the standing surface translated mediolaterally following similar trajectories. Participants were not provided instructions regarding how to respond to the stimuli. Vibration significantly increased mediolateral sway for frequencies greater than 0.5 Hz, while surface translation caused substantial sway increases throughout the investigated frequency range.

Objective: To quantify the impact of paraformaldehyde (PFA) shelf life on thrombus molecular integrity using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and principal component analysis (PCA). Methods: Ten pulmonary artery thrombi were fixed in either aged PFA (6 months; n = 6) or freshly prepared 4% PFA (n = 4); an in-vitro plasma clot control received the same fresh PFA. Triplicate ATR-FTIR spectra (400-4000 cm^-1) were collected, pre-processed (rubber-band baseline correction, Savitzky-Golay smoothing), and vector normalized to the Amide I band before PCA. Fixative chemistry was assessed by the carbonyl absorbance at 1700 cm^-1. Results: Freshly fixed thrombi displayed narrow Amide I (~1650 cm^-1) and Amide II (~1540 cm^-1) bands with a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR; median 41.8) than aged-PFA samples (18.2; P < .01). Carbonyl absorbance at 1700 cm^-1 was markedly higher in fresh PFA.

In an fMRI experiment, participants viewed faces that varied in attractiveness under three conditions: (i) suppressed from awareness via continuous flash suppression (CFS), (ii) clearly visible without suppression, or (iii) absent (background only) with CFS. Participants reported trial-wise facial identity (objective) and visibility (subjective) measures of facial awareness. In a post-fMRI session, they rated the attractiveness of each face as a measure of SV. When faces were seen, task performance (d') exceeded chance and responses were faster than in absent trials. When faces were unseen, performance was at chance but responses were slower than absent trials. Neurally, seen and unseen faces elicited greater neural signal than absent trials and showed similar neural patterns in the fusiform face area (FFA). Critically, neural signal in vmPFC correlated with SV for both seen and unseen faces, with similar neural patterns. In aVS, SV-related signal was only observed for unseen faces. Furthermore, mean face-related signal in FFA correlated with SV-related signals in aVS and vmPFC for unseen faces.

This challenges a core assumption of many language processing models: that combinatory operations depend on prior lexical access. Further, studies using parallel presentation of full sentences have revealed electrophysiological responses remarkably similar to those well established for single words. This raises the question of whether words, phrases, and sentences all move through the same processing stages, regardless of syntactic complexity. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we examined how single words, phrases, and sentences are processed when all visual information is available at once. Across all three levels, we observed highly similar waveform dynamics, with early responses reflecting bottom-up detection of form followed by activity in the left anterior and posterior temporal cortices and vmPFC consistent with combinatory processing. Of these regions, the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) showed effects of bigram frequency suggestive of serial left-to-right dynamics.

In grapevine (Vitis vinifera), the hexose transporter VvHT5, an ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana STP13, is strongly induced during fungal infections, suggesting a role in defense-related sugar partitioning. Here, we examined the function of VvHT5 in grapevine susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea. Transgenic lines overexpressing VvHT5 were generated in two cultivars, Thompson Seedless and Chardonnay, and displayed increased sugar uptake in leaves. Upon B. cinerea inoculation, these lines exhibited enhanced lesion development and fungal proliferation, contrasting with the tolerance phenotype previously observed in A. thaliana expressing VvHT5. Dual RNA-seq analysis revealed that VvHT5 overexpression triggers a transcriptional landscape favoring carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall remodeling, and attenuation of defense responses, paralleled by upregulation of fungal genes involved in sugar acquisition and virulence. These results demonstrate that while VvHT5 contributes to restricting sugar availability to pathogens in Arabidopsis, its constitutive activation in grapevine enhances host suitability for B. cinerea.

Here, we dissect how the core RAS [-&gt;]RAF[-&gt;]MEK[-&gt;]ERK pathway's control of nascent adhesions contributes to edge protrusion and cell migration by targeting an ERK FRET biosensor to adhesions and quantifying ERK's spatial and temporal activity. We find that ERK is activated in the assembling, membrane-proximal region of nascent adhesions through adhesion scaffold paxillin, which interacts with the ERK activator MEK. Tracking nascent adhesion dynamics during cell migration showed that ERK promotes both nascent adhesion assembly and disassembly to create a population of nascent adhesions with short lifetimes. MEK inhibition is partially complemented by expression of a talin R8vvv mutant that increases the nascent adhesion population, demonstrating the significance of ERK's adhesion regulation for edge protrusion and migration persistence. These findings suggest that when new adhesions initiate, the ERK activation level dictates adhesion assembly and disassembly rates to specifically build nascent adhesions that rapidly turnover, an adhesion population that promotes protrusion persistence and migration.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) are both inherited respiratory disorders that result in impaired mucociliary clearance, and chronic sinopulmonary disease. Although the current approach to PCD management is extrapolated from CF care, both conditions arise from distinct genetic and molecular mechanisms. Methods. Here we performed a comparative transcriptomic analysis between CF and PCD to compare the cellular heterogeneity, molecular pathways and gene networks differences using publicly available sequencing data as well as those performed by our group. To explore gene regulatory networks, a pre-trained transformer model (scGPT) was fine-tuned using an integrated dataset, and differential attention analysis was conducted to identify genes and pathways with altered attention scores between the two conditions. Results. The comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct molecular signatures between PCD and CF, which differed from normal cells. In ciliated cells, differential gene expression and pathway investigation highlighted the NRF2 pathway considerable overrepresentation in PCD compared to CF and healthy conditions. This observation was further supported by scGPT analysis, which revealed increased incoming attention to the NRF2 pathway markers. In secretory cells, PCD and CF exhibited increased immune and inflammatory signaling compared to controls. While similar inflammatory processes were active, results suggested a stronger inflammatory pattern in CF secretory cells compared to PCD and confirmed the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. Conclusion. These findings highlight the different molecular signatures between both conditions and the need for unique approaches to management in PCD compared to CF.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Our dataset expands existing cerebral vascular transcriptomic profiles and reveals that Lama4-/- endothelial cells exhibit increased arterial marker expression and reduced postcapillary venule identity. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that compensatory upregulation of laminin 5 in Lama4-/- vessels enhances expression of junctional proteins (Ocln, Cldn5) and promotes vessel contractility via increased expression of contractile molecules in mural cells. Additionally, loss of Lama4 upregulates expression of large artery markers (Gja4, Dll4, Tgfb2) and results in elevated autotaxin (Enpp2) levels, a key enzyme in lysophosphatidic acid production implicated in stroke. Accordingly, Lama4-/- mice exhibit worsened stroke outcomes, driven not by immune infiltration or junctional defects, but by increased vascular permeability likely mediated by autotaxin and/or activation of resident myeloid cells. Our data suggest that laminin 4/5 ratios in vascular BMs regulate functional zonation between arterioles, capillaries and postcapillary venules by modulating metabolic pathways in endothelial and mural cells, and indirectly influencing resident myeloid cells.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Regions of alternating high and moderate to low levels of DNA methylation exist along all chromosomes in human cells. It is unclear how these distinct DNA methylation blocks are established. Here we have profiled DNA methylation at single base resolution and various histone modifications in human bronchial epithelial cells. We found that many regions of lower DNA methylation are characterized by presence of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) mark histone H3 K27 trimethylation but less so by the PRC1 mark histone H2A K119 monoubiquitylation. These same PRC2-marked regions also showed a depletion of histone H3K36 di- and tri-methylation. Since H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 are recognized by the reader domains of the DNA methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B and H3K36 methylation is a block to the PRC2 methyltransferases, these crosstalks explain the stable maintenance and antagonism of H3K27me3 and DNA methylation domains. The data give insight into how DNA methylation patterns are established in human cells.

When unaccounted for, these differences can result in a bias toward single-batch clusters as well as greater sensitivity to \"noisier\" batches during clustering. Here we propose mitigating these effects using null models fitted separately to the bulk of analyte-analyte correlations within each batch and across each pair of batches. We then map the batch-specific null models to a standard null model, removing batch-dependent distributional differences. This approach is compatible with any correlation-based clustering approach. Since the null model represents information not captured in individual pairwise correlations, we show how to incorporate this additional information into both distance-based clustering and WCNA. For distance-based clustering, we increase distances corresponding to correlations consistent with the null model. For WCNA, we provide a new soft threshold (adjacency) function based on the likelihood of a correlation under the null model. The resulting network can be easily incorporated into the WCNA workflow. These methods are implemented in R package standardcor, and we illustrate the package on simulated data as well as an existing multi-omic dataset.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Recent preclinical studies suggest that incorporating treatment-free intervals (TFIs) into dosing schedules may enhance therapeutic outcomes. Methods: To systematically evaluate alternative TFI strategies, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) of tumor - T cell interactions under various blinatumomab dosing regimens. The model was calibrated using published in vitro data and incorporated spatial, stochastic, and mechanistic rules governing T cell activation, cytotoxicity, proliferation, and exhaustion. Results: Our ABM recapitulates experimental observations showing that a 7-day TFI improved T cell function over continuous dosing during the initial 28-day treatment period. However, when simulations were extended to a full 42-day cycle to mimic clinical regimen, this advantage was lost. In contrast, shorter TFIs consistently outperformed both 7-day and continuous schedules, leading to superior tumor control at all timepoints. A translationally oriented Monday-through-Friday (MO-FR) regimen also achieved comparable benefits. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the empirically tested 7-day TFI schedule may not be optimal. TFI with shorter intervals as well as translationally relevant schedules such as MO-FR, may offer greater therapeutic benefit. This work demonstrates the value of ABM in preclinical immunotherapy design and supports model-guided refinement of TCE dosing strategies prior to clinical translation. Future work will focus on validating these predictions in more complex in vivo models and leveraging patient-derived data to guide personalized TCE treatment design.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

To distinguish these accounts, we constructed probability distributions of memory from participants iterative reports of motion direction on each trial. Remarkably, the idiosyncratic shape of these distributions (e.g., asymmetry) on single trials matched the shape of neural probability distributions decoded from fMRI patterns measured from occipital and parietal cortex.

This has led to widespread declines of predators in ecosystems worldwide leading to far-reaching effects on ecosystem processes. We investigate how the loss of predators from nearshore ecosystems due to fishing affects individual prey behaviour using a gradient of protection as a natural experiment. We collected data on piscivorous predator assemblages, reef habitats and prey behaviour within and outside two marine protected areas (MPAs) in the South Andaman Islands, India. As expected, predator abundance was significantly greater within MPAs. Similarly, we found greater coral cover and reduced algal cover within MPAs. In response, prey species, which included herbivorous and invertivorous fish, exhibited reduced movement and heightened vigilance inside MPAs. Additionally, prey individuals foraged at higher rates within MPAs. Habitat complexity and resource availability had complex effects on prey behaviours that varied across guilds. Our findings suggest that fishing directly alters the seascape of fear through the removal of predators. Fishing may also shape prey behaviour and ecological interactions indirectly through habitat degradation. Overall, this study highlights the need to study both direct and indirect consequences of human interactions with wild animals to understand their combined impacts on ecosystems.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

L.; Wodarz, D.", "abstract": "Expanding cell populations, such as bacterial and tumor colonies, continuously accumulate mutations as they grow. However, how mutational burden depends on cell turnover, i.e. the ratio of birth and death rates, remains poorly understood. Elucidating this relationship is crucial for predicting how populations adapt to changing environments, including during evolutionary rescue and resistance evolution. Previous theory suggested that higher turnover increases mutant abundance at a given population size, since more cell divisions are required to reach that size. Using well-mixed and spatial stochastic models, we find the relationship is more nuanced. For advantageous mutants, higher turnover does increase mutant numbers. For disadvantageous mutants, however, mutant abundance can actually decreases with turnover or exhibit non-monotonic behavior, with these somewhat counterintuitive patterns being more pronounced in spatially expanding populations. We derive explicit analytical boundaries separating different regimes and quantify the contribution of stochastic ``jackpot\" events to mutant burden. In spatial models, we show that the interplay between two timescales is critical: the time to reach the target population size versus the time for wild-type cells to erode disadvantageous mutant clusters.

A long-standing challenge has been applying LC-MS at physiological pH under native conditions using volatile buffers. The predominant 'buffer' used, ammonium acetate (AmAc, pKa 4.75 for acetic acid and 9.25 for ammonium), does not offer sufficient buffering capacity in the physiological pH range of 7.0-7.4. To address this, we evaluated a set of fluorinated ethylamines, 2-fluoroethylamine (MFEA, pKa 8.9), 2,2-difluoroethylamine (DFEA, pKa 7.2), and 2,2,2-trifluoroethylamine (TFEA, pKa 5.5), that together provide buffering across the 4.5-9.8 pH range. We show that protein separations on strong cation- and anion-exchange resins in these volatile mobile phases perform comparably to traditional non-volatile buffers, with similar elution profiles and analyte elution ranking, albeit with slightly broader peaks. Using fully volatile gradients of pH or ionic strength, we chromatographically resolved charge variants of protein analytes such as mAbs and bovine serum albumin. For many of the eluting LC peaks, we obtained high-resolution mass spectra capable of resolving glycoforms of antibodies. Hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) in volatile mobile phases preserved native separation order and further resolved drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) species of the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab-vedotin. For each chromatography modality we further compare innovator and biosimilar antibodies, demonstrating the reproducibility of results in the proposed volatile compounds. Together, our results establish fluorinated ethylamines, in combination with ammonium acetate, as a universal volatile buffer system for native LC-MS, broadly applicable across major chromatographic modalities while maintaining compatibility with mass spectrometry.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

Building on previous work in which DNA-barcoded probes were developed for the multiplexed detection of biomarkers, this study explores different analytical approaches for interpreting binary nanopore signals. The method relies on identifying two classes of events: (1) non-delayed signals, indicating the absence of a target biomarker, and (2) delayed signals, resulting from probe-target interactions, proving the presence of the biomarker. To classify these events and enable robust biomarker detection, we applied three different computational strategies: (1) moving standard deviation (MSD), (2) spectral entropy (SE), and (3) a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. While MSD and SE represent conventional, rule-based approaches requiring manually defined thresholds, the CNN model offers a more scalable, automated solution for classifying nanopore events directly from raw time series data. All three methods were capable of distinguishing between signal classes; however, the CNN model demonstrated superior sensitivity and robustness. This work highlights the importance of data interpretation in nanopore sensing and presents a comparative framework for binary event classification.

To define metabolic vulnerabilities of recurrent disease, we performed a CRISPR knockout screen targeting 421 metabolic genes in paired primary and recurrent HER2-driven breast cancer cell lines. While both primary and recurrent tumors shared dependencies on core metabolic pathways, recurrent tumors exhibited selective essentiality for the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway, including Cad, Dhodh, and Ctps. Pharmacologic inhibition of the rate-limiting enzyme DHODH with BAY-2402234 selectively impaired the growth of recurrent tumor cells, while primary tumor cells were relatively resistant. BAY treatment robustly inhibited pyrimidine synthesis in all lines, but only recurrent cells underwent iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and ferroptotic cell death. Lipidomic profiling revealed enrichment of polyunsaturated ether phospholipids in recurrent cells, which may predispose them to ferroptosis. A sensitizer CRISPR screen in primary cells further identified nucleotide salvage and lipid metabolic pathways as modifiers of DHODH inhibitor sensitivity. Stable isotope tracing and nutrient depletion experiments showed that primary cells can compensate for DHODH inhibition through nucleotide salvage, whereas recurrent cells exhibit impaired salvage capacity, likely due to reduced expression of Slc28/Slc29 nucleoside transporters. Together, these findings reveal that breast cancer recurrence is associated with increased dependence on de novo pyrimidine synthesis to suppress ferroptosis, highlighting a therapeutically actionable metabolic vulnerability in recurrent disease.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}

This is achieved, in part, through a process termed habituation, in which responses to repeated or constant sensory inputs are sequentially dampened, favouring robust responses to novel stimuli. Prior investigations in the fruit fly, Drosophila, have uncovered genes and neural mechanisms that facilitate habituation. However, these works have primarily focused on habituation to visual, olfactory, and gustatory, stimuli. In contrast, neurogenetic processes promoting habituation to mechanosensory stimuli have been less studied. Here we develop an automated system that yields long-term analogue measurements of mechanosensory habituation in adult fruit flies. Using this platform, we reveal a role for the neuronal calcium sensor Neurocalcin in habituation to mechanical stimuli. Loss of Neurocalcin disrupts nighttime but not daytime sleep, particularly under long-night conditions. Mimicking a method used to treat insomnia, we show that compressing nighttime duration restores consolidated night sleep in Neurocalcin mutants. Surprisingly, this manipulation also renormalises mechanosensory habituation in this background, suggesting a link between sleep and mechanosensory habituation. Indeed, we show that limiting night sleep duration in wild type flies similarly impairs habituation to mechanosensory stimuli. Collectively, our findings reveal a previously unappreciated link between nighttime sleep and mechanosensory habituation in Drosophila.", "date": "2025-11-17", "journal": ""}
