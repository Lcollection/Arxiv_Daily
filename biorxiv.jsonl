N.; Fronhofer, E. A.", "abstract": "Dispersal is key to understanding ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Dispersal may itself evolve and exhibit phenotypic plasticity. Specifically, organisms may modulate their dispersal rates in response to the density of their conspecifics (density-dependent dispersal) and their own sex (sex-biased dispersal). While optimal dispersal plastic responses have been derived from first principles, the genetic and molecular basis of dispersal plasticity has not been modelled. An understanding of the genetic architecture of dispersal plasticity is especially relevant for understanding dispersal evolution during rapidly changing spatial ecological conditions such as range expansions. In this context, we develop an individual-based metapopulation model of the evolution of density-dependent and sex-biased dispersal during range expansions. We represent the dispersal trait as a gene-regulatory network (GRN), which can take population density and an individual's sex as an input and analyse emergent context- and condition-dependent dispersal responses. We compare dispersal evolution and ecological dynamics in this GRN model to a standard reaction norm (RN) approach under equilibrium metapopulation conditions and during range expansions. We find that under equilibrium metapopulation conditions, the GRN model produces emergent density-dependent and sex-biased dispersal plastic response shapes that match the theoretical expectation of the RN model. However, during range expansion, when mutation effects are large enough, the GRN model leads to faster range expansion because GRNs can maintain higher adaptive potential. Our results imply that, in order to understand eco-evolutionary dynamics in contemporary time, the genetic architecture of traits must be taken into account.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

We find a generalised reduction in expression of homeostatic genes such as Epcam, Pls1 (fimbrin) and Zg16, while cell adhesion (eg Cldn3, Cdh17) and immune-protective (Pla2g4c) loci are upregulated. Specific genes and cell types are associated with different spatial niches (lower crypt, upper crypt, villi and granuloma). Within the crypts, pathway analysis indicates activation of the osteopontin (Spp1) and pleiotrophin (Ptn) pathways that are poorly represented in steady-state tissues, whilst Wnt signalling within the crypts is abrogated by day 7 of infection. Granulomas contain concentrations of myeloid cells, NK and dendritic cells, with high expression levels of genes linked to M2 macrophages (Arg1, Retlna, Fcer1g) and wound repair pathways (Reg3b and Mxra7) as well as elevated Tmbx4 that has not previously been noted. Analysis of potential ligand-receptor pairs confirmed a major complementarity between granuloma-localised SPP1 and CD44 receptors in both crypt and granuloma, as well as TGF-{beta}/receptor interactions. Infected tissues also revealed abundant chemokine representation; among the latter category CCL6, CCL8 and MIF (macrophage migration inhibitory factor) dominated potential interactions.

Listening to periodically-modulated sound, observers discriminated between two visual object streams flickering at different rates, in order to identify an AV match. Peripheral color cues were shown simultaneously, and evaluated for their ability to modulate participant responses due to a color-reward associative training taken beforehand. Behavioral sensitivity and electroencephalography recordings show that performance impoverished in presence of colors previously associated with reward, as did the phase locking of AV responses. Decreased temporal precision predicted participants' reward-driven distraction, evidencing the attentional shift away from temporal representations of the multimodal target.

Indeed, even if it is recognized that the organization of the viral protein sequence space requires sensitive homology detection methods, such methods have never been applied at a large scale. To produce a more realistic and comprehensive view of the protein diversity in the viral world, we have (i) collected thousands of viromes and identified viral contigs and proteins within them, (ii) retrieved viral proteins available in different public databases, and (iii) applied sensitive similarity searches to cluster all these proteins into families and (iv) annotated the protein clusters produced. More than 46 million deduplicated proteins were clustered into less than 2.3 million protein families. After further removing genomic sequences likely of cellular origin using an iterative procedure, the remaining 2,203,457 clusters were coined enVhogs (for environmental Viral homologous groups). Their multiple sequence alignments have been transformed into HMMs to constitute the EnVhog database. Even if only a small proportion of enVhogs were annotated (15.9%), they encompass almost half of the protein dataset (44.8%). Applied to the annotation of four recently published viromes from diverse environments (sulfuric soil, grassland, surface seawater and human gut), enVhog HMMs doubled the number of viral sequences characterized, and increased by 54%-74% the number of proteins functionally annotated.

TLRs contain two specialized domains, a signaling domain (TIR), and a receptor domain composed of tandem repeats of short 20-30 amino acid segments called Leucine-rich Repeats (LRRs). LRR domains, often paired with other domains, are widespread in all kingdoms of life, invariably forming highly similar, solenoid-like three dimensional structures. Despite this structural conservation, LRR domains overall, and receptor domains of TLRs in particular, exhibit remarkable diversity in binding specificity, recognizing diverse ligands such as lipoproteins, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, other proteins and protein complexes. To understand how this conserved scaffold can accommodate such binding diversity, we performed an in-depth analysis of sequential and structural conservation of individual repeats within the LRR domain of each of the ten human TLRs. We demonstrate that the small variations in repeat lengths and local sequence patterns lead to subtle, but critical structural adaptations, such as changes in local curvature, emergence of loops, cavities and interaction interfaces, each contributing to recognition of specific ligands and formation of the receptor complexes. TLR polymorphisms in human populations can further fine-tune the specificity and strength of ligand recognition, influencing how individuals respond to different pathogens and cell damage causing diseases. We show that in most cases the interfaces with the ligands show high level of polymorphism, suggesting a potential for diverse immune responses to infections among human populations while interfaces with other proteins in the receptor complex are more conserved, pointing to the importance of conserving the overall structure of the signaling pathways. By studying how divergence in LRR repeats affects TLRs structure and function, we provide deeper insights into TLR recognition mechanisms, and a better understanding of the mechanism of evolutionary adaptability of immune recognition systems, both along the evolution of vertebrates, and across the human population.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Although some polarity-promoting mechanisms have been described, many chemoreceptors lack clear routes to becoming polar. TlpD of the bacterial pathogen Helicobacter pylori is one such protein. This cytoplasmic chemoreceptor localizes to the pole in a manner that is independent of the other chemoreceptors. In this work, we evaluated the role of TlpD domains in its function. Truncated proteins were created that lacked different amounts of the N- or C-termini and expressed in H. pylori in place of native tlpD or as the sole chemoreceptor. These TlpD variants were examined for expression, protein localization, association with chemotaxis signaling proteins, and effect on motility. TlpD that lacked any portion of the N-terminal 104 amino acids did not produce detectable protein. In contrast, TlpD retained expression with loss of the C-terminal 45 amino acids. TlpD lacking the last 45 amino acids (TlpD{triangleup}C4) preserved the ability to interact with CheW and CheV proteins based on bacterial two-hybrid analysis but were unable to localize to the pole either on their own or in the presence of other chemoreceptors. TlpD{triangleup}C4 was found diffuse in the cytoplasm, and interacted with CheV1, CheV2, and CheV3 at this location but not CheW. TlpD{triangleup}C4 did not confer chemotactic abilities in soft agar chemotaxis assays.

Using embeddings from protein language models, our method computes the differences between the homolog's wild type and its variants, which are applied to the target wild type to generate its synthetic variants in the embedding space. We evaluate this approach on three protein families: IGPS, GFP, and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, under various prediction models and training data sizes.

Differences between images, within a range, provide useful information about depth (stereopsis). Interocular disparities that are not effectively combined result in diplopia and rivalry. The neural mechanisms underlying these binocular interactions remain poorly understood. Using a combination of visually evoked potential (VEP) recordings, unit recordings, and 2-photon calcium imaging in the binocular region of mouse primary visual cortex (bV1), we probed the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of two distinct forms of disparate binocular signals. Using a dichoptic display, introduction of a spatial interocular phase disparity in grating stimuli reduced VEP magnitude through decreased neuronal firing in the early phase of the response (40-80 ms after stimulus onset, corresponding to the VEP negativity). Introduction of an interocular orientation disparity also decreased VEP magnitude, but this difference was driven by an increase in firing in the late portion of the visual response (100-200 ms after stimulus onset, corresponding to the VEP positivity). This increase in activity was observed for both regular-spiking (putative excitatory) and fast-spiking (putative parvalbumin-positive inhibitory) units. By contrast, visually evoked calcium responses of somatostatin-positive interneurons decreased with introduction of the interocular orientation disparity. Based on these results, we propose that interocular phase differences largely suppress bV1 responses via feedforward thalamocortical interactions, whereas interocular orientation differences prolong visually evoked activity in bV1 through somatostatin-positive interneuron-mediated disinhibition.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Identifying functional changes at each stage, from inception to development to maturation, functional execution, and eventual death or pathological transformation, often requires systematic comparisons of functional expression across cell populations. However, because cells of the same type often exhibit similar gene expression patterns regardless of function or fate, it is challenging to distinguish the stages of cellular fate or functional states within the same cell type, which also limits our understanding of cellular memory. Cells of the same type that share structural and gene expression similarities but originate from different regions and perform slightly distinct functions often retain unique epigenetic memory signatures. Although RNA serves as a key executor of fundamental cellular functions, its high expression similarity among cells of the same type limits its ability to distinguish functional heterogeneity. To overcome this challenge, we developed TOGGLE, utilizing higher resolution analytical methods to uncover functional diversity at the cellular level. Then we based on TOGGLE developed an innovative Graph Diffusion Functional Map, which can significantly reduce noise, thereby more clearly displaying the functional grouping of RNA and enabling the capture of more subtle functional differences in high dimensional data.

Our data revealed that RGs transition from early to late over time, sequentially producing intermediate neuronal progenitors (INPs) and intermediate glial progenitors (IGPs). While INPs expand exclusively to generate PyNs, IGPs progress from young to old, sequentially producing cortical astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and olfactory bulb interneurons. We constructed comprehensive molecular maps that reflect cell lineage progression. Our study reveals that chromatin accessibility drives cellular diversification by restricting broadly expressed transcription factors to specific stages and cell types. For instance, Lhx2, which is constantly expressed in RGs across all stages, exhibits reduced DNA-binding activity as development progresses. Lhx2 maintains neurogenic competence by establishing an active epigenetic state at neurogenic genes. As RGs transition to later stages, the chromatin regions bound by Lhx2 become inaccessible, leading to the loss of neurogenic competence and the acquisition of gliogenic competence.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Pre-trained on 1 million simulated genomes using 0.8 billion parameters, it captures evolutionary signatures of 6 million SNPs, encoding linkage disequilibrium and haplotype structures with high fidelity. This paradigm-shifting model supports versatile tasks. In genotype imputation, it matches leading algorithms in performance and, when fine-tuned, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy. In haplotype phasing, it outperforms non-reference methods and rivaling the best reference-based method with a 72-fold speedup. Notably, it compresses 6 million SNPs per individual into a 0.75 MB embedding, enabling efficient storage, transfer and downstream applications. In particular, SNPBag embeddings facilitate rapid ancestry inference across global populations and detection of genetic relationships up to 12th-degree relatives. To summarize, SNPBag establishes a scalable, self-sufficient, multitasking AI framework, poised to transform SNP data analysis and unlock the growing potential of biobank resources.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Central to realizing this vision is the ability to model cell differentiation dynamics, which requires accurate inference of gene regulatory network (GRN) that govern cell fate decisions. However, existing computational approaches rely on static GRN models that fail to capture the dynamic changes of regulatory relationships during differentiation, limiting their utility for simulating developmental processes and predicting perturbation outcomes. Here, we present CellProphet, an interpretable AI model that infers dynamic GRN by integrating temporal causality with transformer self-attention mechanism. CellProphet captures time-lagged dependencies between transcription factor (TF) expression and target gene activation while providing interpretable regulatory weights, enabling both accurate prediction and mechanistic insight. When benchmarked against nine state-of-the-art methods across seven differentiation datasets, CellProphet achieves superior performance in all evaluation metrics. Applied to mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation, CellProphet identifies both well-known and potentially novel TFs with substantially high sensitivity and successfully reconstructs dynamic regulatory relations validated through multi-modal epigenomic data. In mouse hematopoietic differentiation, CellProphet accurately predicts cell fate transitions and gene expression changes following in silico perturbation of key TFs Gata1 and Spi1, demonstrating its capability for virtual experimentation. These results establish CellProphet as a foundational tool for the AIVC framework, enabling researchers to decode the dynamic regulatory logic of differentiation, accelerate discovery of key regulatory factors, and design targeted cellular interventions for widespread applications.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

A.; Lemaitre, B.", "abstract": "Abstract The host innate immune response relies on the cooperation of multiple defence modules. In insects and other arthropods, which have only innate immune mechanisms, four main immune-specific modules have been described in the defence against microbial invaders: the Toll pathway, the Imd pathway, the melanization response, and phagocytosis by plasmatocytes. Our present understanding of their relative importance remains fragmented as their contribution to host defence has never been simultaneously assessed across a large panel of pathogens. Here, we have taken advantage of newly-described immune mutants in a controlled genetic background to systematically delete these four immune modules individually, in pairs, or even all four simultaneously. Surprisingly, immune deficient flies simultaneously deficient in all four immune modules are viable, homozygous fertile, and display no overt morphological defects, suggesting these immune mechanisms are not strictly required for organismal development. With this new set of lines, we assessed the contribution of each module individually and collectively to host defense against five viruses, three fungi, eight Gram-positive bacteria, and eight Gram-negative bacteria. Our findings show that these four modules largely function independently and additively in host defense, although synergistic effects can occur for select pairs of modules. Our study confirmed the importance of the Imd pathway against Gram-negative bacteria and the Toll pathway against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, largely via the induction of effectors such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and Bomanins (Bom), but also reveals the important role of melanization against viruses, and the contribution of phagocytosis against various germs. Additionally, by examining microbial load kinetics in different mutants, we provide insight into how these modules contribute to tolerance or resistance against specific microbes. Our study provides insights into the architecture of the Drosophila immune system, revealing differential requirements of immune modules according to each pathogen. The set of immune deficient lines provided here offer tools to better assess the role of these immune modules in host defense.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

A.", "abstract": "Background: Thrombin is generated from its precursor prothrombin by sequential cleavage at Arg320 and Arg271 by the prothrombinase complex, composed of factor (f) Xa and fVa on phospholipid (PL) membrane surfaces. The affinity of human fXa for fVa is low in the absence of PL. However, fXa orthologues from the venom of group D snakes bind to fVa with high affinity, forming an active complex without PL. We previously characterized the properties of the fXa orthologue Hopsarin D (HopD) from Hoplocephalus stephensii. Objectives: Here we set out to create a PL-independent human prothrombinase by making mutations to fXa, guided by a model of the prothrombinase complex and the sequence differences between human fXa and HopD. Methods: We assessed the contribution of individual domains of fXa to its binding to fVa by swapping each with the corresponding domain of HopD. We then chose three loops in the serine protease (SP) domain predicted to be in contact with fVa to swap to those of HopD. Eventually, 10 residues from the three loops in the SP domain and 7 from the EGF2 domain were selected for mutation. Results: The resulting M17 fXa variant bound to fVa with a Kd of ~20 nM, similar to HopD, and together efficiently processed prothrombin through the meizothrombin intermediate in the absence of PL. Conclusions: We conclude that the role of PL membranes in prothrombinase assembly and function is limited to improving the affinity of fXa for fVa. The M17-fVa complex is likely to be structurally equivalent to the human prothrombinase complex.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

In this article, we present a new measure phenological lag to quantify the overall effect of phenological constraints including insufficient winter chilling, photoperiod, and environmental stresses, based on observed response and that expected from species-specific changes in spring temperatures, i.e., changes in spring forcing (degree days) from warming and average temperature at budburst with the warmer climate. We applied this new analytical framework to a global dataset with 980 species and 1527 responses to synthesize observed changes in spring budburst (leafing or flowering) and investigate the mechanisms of differential phenological responses reported previously. We found longer phenological lags with experimental studies and native plants in flowering, likely due to more stressful environments associated with warmer and drier climate. Less forcing changes were mainly responsible for the smaller responses in leafing and flowering in boreal region (compared to temperate region) and in grass leafing (compared to trees and shrubs). Higher budburst temperatures also contributed to the smaller responses in flowering for experimental studies and with herbs and grasses. The effects of altitude, latitude, MAT, and average spring temperature change were minor (all combined <2.5% variations), while those of photoperiod and long-term precipitation were not significant in influencing spring phenology. Our method helps to determine mechanisms responsible for changes in spring phenology and differences in plant phenological responses.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Biocompatible ionic liquids (ILs) are tunable materials that can modulate nanoparticle interactions with blood components. Choline trans-2-hexenoate (C2HA) is an IL known to facilitate red blood cell (RBC) hitchhiking of PLGA polymeric nanoparticles and reduces hepatic uptake and therefore enabling transport to distant non-hepatic organs. We wanted to determine if C2HA coatings can show similar RBC hitchhiking effects with LNPs. We previously demonstrated that IL-coated LNPs reduce serum protein binding to LNPs, a key contributor to rapid clearance via the liver. While LNPs coated with choline trans-2-hexenoate at 1:1 and 1:2 cation: anion ratios decreased mouse serum protein binding and improved cellular uptake into brain endothelial cells (BECs) and motor neurons, they did not show hitchhiking behavior. To identify IL formulations capable of this behavior, we screened higher IL cation: anion ratios (1:3 and 1:5) for LNP coating and optimized IL volumes that allowed stable particle diameters. The resulting IL-coated LNPs successfully hitchhiked on both mouse and human RBCs and significantly enhanced uptake in b.End3 mouse BECs, and NSC-34 neuroblastoma cells compared to uncoated LNPs. 1:3 IL-coated LNPs demonstrated the most pronounced improvement in RBC binding. Whole blood pharmacokinetic and biodistribution analyses demonstrated that IL-coating significantly extends the circulation time of LNPs and results in reduced hepatic uptake alongside increased routing to the brain, compared to standard LNPs. These findings reveal that ILs can be leveraged to re-engineer clinically approved LNP platforms to promote RBC hitchhiking behavior and further be developed for drug delivery to challenging extra-hepatic targets such as the brain.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

While the response of leaf functional traits to these climate change factors have been widely studied, reproductive traits remain relatively understudied, despite their key role in the diversification and distribution of flowering plants. Here, we investigated how elevated CO2, warming, drought, and their interactions affect floral, leaf and seed traits in two model grassland species. We also examined how these factors influence trait coordination. Methods: Two common grassland species, Lotus corniculatus and Crepis capillaris, were sampled from a 10-year climate manipulation experiment. We measured resource economic traits related to organ size, construction cost, and dry matter content in both leaves and flowers, along with seed size and number. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess trait responses, and rank-abundance curves were employed to visualize changes in trait coordination across treatments. Key Results: Trait responses to climate change factors varied between species. Drought emerged as the most influential factor, affecting only leaf traits in L. corniculatus, but impacting leaf, floral, and seed traits in C. capillaris. Across both species, climate change conditions increased leaf construction costs and reduced flower size. In addition, it led to larger leaves in L. corniculatus, and fewer seeds in C. capillaris. Under extreme climate change conditions, trait coordination became stronger in both species, although C. capillaris showed no coordination response specifically to drought. Conclusion: Our results show that floral economic traits, like leaf traits, are responsive to individual and combined effects of climate change factors. This highlights their importance in shaping plant strategies under environmental stress and emphasizes the need to better integrate floral traits into the whole-plant economic framework.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Innervation of the degenerating intervertebral disc (IVD) is suspected to cause discogenic LBP, but the mechanisms that orchestrate the IVD's neo-innervation and subsequent symptoms of LBP remain unknown. We hypothesize that Vascular Growth Endothelial Factor-A (VEGFA) critically mediates the neurite invasion in the IVD and contributes to prolonged LBP. Initiating IVD degeneration through a mechanical injury, we evaluated the progression of neurovascular features into the IVD, as well as resultant LBP symptoms and locomotive performance at acute (3-weeks) and prolonged (12-weeks) time points following IVD injury. To determine the role of VEGFA, we used a mouse model with ubiquitous inducible recombination of the floxed VEGFA allele (UBC-CreERT2; VEGFAfl/fl). The ablation of VEGFA attenuated the neurite and vessel infiltration into the degenerating IVD, and the VEGFA-null animals exhibited alleviated mechanical allodynia and improved locomotive performance. To determine the effects of IVD-derived VEGFA on endothelial cells and neurons, we cultured HMEC-1 endothelial cells and SH-SY5Y neurons using conditioned media from VEGFA-silenced (siRNA) human primary IVD cells stimulated by IL1b. The endothelial cells and neurons exposed to the secretome of the VEGFA-silenced IVD cells exhibited reduced growth, suggesting that the inhibition of IVD-derived VEGFA may be sufficient to attenuate intradiscal neurovascular features.

We also measured changes in call similarity for a subset of individuals that were recorded before and after co-housing. We found that co-housing caused vocal convergence.

Single-cell RNA sequencing of cortical tissue revealed selective expression of Pycard (PYD and CARD domain containing), also known as Asc (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), which encodes the inflammasome adaptor ASC, predominantly in microglial clusters.

We present a novel integrative approach to translate laboratory experiments on arterial samples into clinically relevant pressure-diameter behavior. We perform controlled planar-biaxial tests on carotid arteries under three stretch ratios and generate axial and circumferential stress-stretch data to calibrate a fiber-reinforced soft tissue model. Using an analytical thick-walled cylindrical model, we predict subject-specific pressure-diameter behavior, informed by arterial prestretches from ring opening experiments. We systematically compare predictions against extension-inflation experiments on tubes from the same artery by applying controlled pairs of axial stretch and inner pressure, while recording outer diameter. We quantify prediction error in absolute and relative stretch regimes and evaluate the importance of the load-free reference dimensions. Results show how planar-biaxial tests probe different stretch regimes compared to extension-inflation deformations, leading to extrapolation of model predictions. We demonstrate how the constitutive material parameters can be fitted to different biomechanical loading conditions and assess the sensitivity of the simulations to axial stretch and circumferential prestretch.

Listeners achieve robust speech comprehension by tracking acoustic variability across talkers and implementing predictions based on their prior knowledge and contextual information. However, how perceptual adaptation to speech and predictive processing influence each other is still largely unknown. In this EEG study, we examined how listeners process continuous speech when exposed to a single familiar talker (Single condition) versus multiple unfamiliar talkers (Multi condition), all with native Italian pronunciation. By applying multivariate Temporal Response Function (TRF), we aimed to determine whether increased talker variability in the Multi condition influences phonemic encoding and predictive processing, as indexed by neural responses to cohort entropy (phonological uncertainty among lexical candidates) and semantic surprisal (lexical prediction error). Results showed increased neural responses to phonemic categories and to cohort entropy in the Multi than in the Single condition. These effects suggest that acoustic variability across talkers increases uncertainty in perceiving individual phonemes, prompting the brain to avoid committing to specific lexical candidates during word processing.

Y.; Marom, N.; Jaffe, Y.; Slon, V.; Greenbaum, G.", "abstract": "One of the strongest selection pressures experienced by human populations is that driven by diseases on immune-related genomic regions. While it has been hypothesized for some time that disease burdens increased with the shift to agricultural and urbanized lifestyles, direct evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Here, we capitalize on the accumulation of ancient genomic data to study changes in disease burden in human populations over the past 12,000 years. We investigated changes in genetic diversity and balancing selection in two distinct geographical and cultural centers in Southwest Eurasia and Eastern Asia, and found that not only is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) the genomic region with the most substantial increases in diversity in terms of enrichment of genes and rates of increase, but that the rates of changes for individual genes are highly correlated between the two cultural centers, indicating similar selection pressures. We identify periods of time with substantial peaks in MHC diversity increase that primarily correspond to periods with settlement intensification, increased connectivity, and the expansion of animal domestication, which suggest that the most intensive disease burden occurred following the transition to sedentary lifestyle but prior to urbanization. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach in uncovering the interplay between cultural shifts and selection, and provide strong support to the hypothesis that the levels of disease burden have substantially increased in recent prehistory following changes in lifestyle, connectivity and the introduction of domesticated animals.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

D.; Galateanu, T.; Marom, S.", "abstract": "We report that axons of cortical neurons, structurally intricate excitable media, maintain remarkably high fidelity in transmitting somatic spike timing, even during complex spontaneous network activity that includes extremely short (2--3 msec) inter-spike intervals. This robustness underscores their function as reliable conducting devices under physiological conditions. It is nevertheless well established that under artificially imposed, high-rate pulsing stimuli, axonal conduction can fail, with vulnerability depending on distance and branching. In line with this, we demonstrate that conduction failures can also occur at frequencies as low as 10 Hz, provided that stimulation is sustained for several seconds. Under these conditions, propagation delays increase and failures accumulate, particularly in distal branches, whereas effects are negligible at 1--4 Hz. Simulations incorporating cumulative sodium channel inactivation at vulnerable sites reproduce these dynamics. Our findings refine the view of axons as active, heterogeneous structures: they are exceptionally reliable across most physiological regimes, yet exhibit limits under prolonged or extreme stimulation, a regime rarely encountered in vivo but critical for understanding axonal excitability.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Multiple novel CISs have been characterised in laboratory bacterial cultures recently; however, studying CISs in the context of the native microbial community remains challenging.

Using cryo-focused ion beam milling and cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) imaging, guided by 16S amplicon sequencing, we discovered that thermophilic Chloroflexota bacteria produce intracellular CIS particles in a natural microbial hot spring mat. We then found a niche-specific production of CIS in the structured microbial community using an approach combining shotgun metagenomics, proteomics, and immunogold staining. Bioinformatic analysis and imaging revealed CISs in other extremophilic Chloroflexota and Deinococcota. This Chloroflexota/Deinococcota CIS lineage shows phylogenetic and structural similarity to previously described cytoplasmic CIS from Streptomyces and probably shares the same cytoplasmic mode of action.

Optimization using response surface methodology (RSM) with a central composite design (CCD) identified acetonitrile: water (80:20, v/v) as the optimal mobile phase, enabling efficient separation within 5 minutes at a flow rate of 0.34 mL/min and detection at 244 nm. Consistent with ICH Q2(R2) guidelines, the method demonstrates excellent linearity (R{superscript 2} > 0.999), precision (% RSD < 2 %), accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity (LOD: 0.04 {micro}g/mL; LOQ: 1.2 {micro}g/mL). The validated method was applied in comprehensive forced degradation studies under diverse stress conditions, including acidic, alkaline, oxidative, thermal, photolytic, and photostatic environments. The LbL coating offered significant protection for budesonide, resulting in less than 20 % degradation under thermal and photostatic stress. In contrast, degradation exceeded 75 % when exposed to alkaline and oxidative conditions, particularly in hydrated environments. These findings underscore the critical importance of nanoparticle design and environmental conditions in ensuring drug stability. Furthermore, in vitro release studies demonstrated a sustained release profile (20.6 % over 48 h), indicating potential for targeted colonic drug delivery.

To address this, we present the Darwin-Godel Drug Discovery Machine (DGDM), a self-improving artificial intelligence framework that integrates generative molecular design and evolution with adaptive meta-learning. DGDM employs a dual-loop architecture: an inner loop frames molecular optimization as a Darwinian evolutionary process guided by reinforcement learning signals, where candidate molecules generated by generative AI are evolved through search and feedback; an outer loop adaptively modifies the discovery pipeline itself. Unlike the original Godel machine, which demands formal proofs of improvement-rarely attainable in practice-DGDM uses statistical validation to bound risk and ensure reliable progress. The framework is fully compatible with modern structural biology tools, including AlphaFold, and supports evaluation through docking, binding affinity prediction, and ADMET profiling. In a proof-of-concept study, DGDM improved the median binding affinity of candidate ligands from -4.457 to -5.422 kcal/mol while maintaining 100% drug-likeness and novelty. These results suggest that bounded-risk, self-improving AI can accelerate drug discovery by continuously refining both molecular design and discovery processes, extending the Godel machine principle of self-improvement into biomedical research.

However, the regulatory principles governing domain-specific cellular functions remain poorly understood due to the lack of effective methods for mapping gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in situ. To address this gap, we introduce STARNet, a representation learning approach that leverages heterogeneous hypergraph modeling of spatial transcriptomic and epigenomic data to resolve tissue-domain specific regulatory interactions. By integrating graph neural networks with contrastive learning in a self-supervised framework, STARNet learns unified embeddings that preserve both multi-modal molecular features and anatomical spatial context, enabling accurate and domain-resolved GRN reconstruction within complex tissues. Benchmarking on both simulated and real datasets demonstrates that STARNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate its broad applicability across diverse biological contexts, including neural development, genetic disease risk, and drug-induced developmental toxicity. In the mouse brain, it delineates region-specific regulatory networks and reconstructs spatiotemporal programs underlying neural stem cell differentiation. In human genetics, it provides a mechanistic link between genotypes and phenotypes by showing how genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for complex diseases perturb hippocampus-specific GRNs. In developmental toxicology, STARNet reveals that drug-induced disruptions of GRNs in defined embryonic regions underlie tissue-specific vulnerability. Collectively, STARNet offers a powerful and versatile framework for resolving the spatial regulatory logic of complex tissues, providing multi-angle insights into tissue patterning, development, and disease mechanisms.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

The juxtamembrane domains of both SYT1 and SYT2 are recognized by botulinum neurotoxin B1 (BoNT/B1), the agent of botulism. Current experimental models describe SYT1 and SYT2 interactions with BoNT/B1 but lack membrane insertion, which may bias the observed interactions. Objective: To explore the interactions of membrane-inserted SYT1 and SYT2 with BoNT/B1 and assess the impact of membrane constraints on these interactions. Methods: We used molecular dynamics simulations to study the conformational changes of membrane-inserted SYT1 and SYT2 when bound to BoNT/B1, focusing on the influence of membrane constraints. Results: Our simulations predict that membrane constraints reshape SYT1 and SYT2, enabling their juxtamembrane domains to interact with the BoNT/B1 lipid-binding loop, a unique interaction not seen in Xray models but in agreement with experimental data. SYT1's conformation is particularly affected, increasing solvent exposure at its BoNT/B1 binding site. The GT1b ganglioside stabilizes this complex by reducing solvent exposure, providing mechanistic insights into its role in BoNT/B1-SYT1 interaction, as experimental data support. Conclusion: Our study reveals overlooked molecular mechanisms in non-membrane models, highlighting dynamics essential to BoNT/B1-SYT interactions.

Here we show by in vitro single-molecule imaging that PDS5 proteins stop loop extrusion by facilitating the dissociation of NIPBL from cohesin. Hi-C experiments suggest that this function is required for the establishment of CTCF boundaries in cells. In silico modelling indicates that PDS5 proteins enable the separation between compartments by limiting cohesin's velocity and chromatin-residence time. The degree of this compartmentalization depends on the frequency with which chromatin is extruded relative to the time it takes for compartments to form.

We evaluate the effectiveness of environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding as a rapid, non-invasive method for surveying vertebrate biodiversity in the Makira Forest Protected Area (MFPA), comparing its performance to conventional surveys across a range of vertebrate taxa. eDNA sampling detected 158 OTUs across 18 sites, outperforming conventional surveys in birds (p = 0.000107), mammals (p = 0.000718) amphibians (p = 0.000725), reptiles (p = 0.000877) and ray-finned fish (p = 0.00788). We further examined the result for ray-finned fish by modelling species-accumulation curve asymptotes which supported this result. However, significant primer bias and amplification inconsistencies were observed, particularly in amphibian detections, and a high proportion of OTUs could not be resolved to species level due to taxonomic gaps in reference databases. We demonstrate, using species accumulation curves of our eDNA data and inventoried taxa lists of the MFPA, that the widespread practice of considering only resolved OTUs, rather than all unresolved OTUs, significantly underestimates biodiversity. This study underscores both the promise and current limitations of eDNA as a tool for tropical biodiversity assessment, specifically when compared to conventional sampling techniques.

Using a discovery dataset (OASIS-3, n = 1032), we trained models on healthy control (HC), subsamples ranging from 5 to 600 individuals, while varying age and sex distributions to simulate biases in reference populations. We further assessed the use of adaptive transfer learning by pre-training models on the UK Biobank (n = 42,747) and adapting them to the clinical dataset applying the same sub-sampling strategies. We evaluated model performance on a fixed HC test set and quantified deviation score errors, outlier detection, and classification accuracy in both the HC test set and the AD cohort. The findings were replicated in an external validation sample (AIBL, n = 463). Across all settings, model performance improved with increasing sample size, but demographic alignment of the covariates, particularly in age, was essential for reliable deviation estimates. Models trained directly within the dataset achieved stable fit with approximately 200 HCs, while adapted models reached comparable performance with as few as 50 individuals when pre-trained on large-scale data.

Current preclinical testing models do not adequately recapitulate the complexity of human arteries. Here, we present tissue-engineered blood vessels (TEBVs) as a novel in vitro model and validate it for intimal hyperplasia. Methods: TEBVs fabricated from SMC suspended in fibrin gel, supported by a textile mesh, were seeded with ECs at various concentrations and subjected to arterial flow conditions in a bioreactor. In addition, TEBVs underwent plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA) and implantation of bare metal stents (BMS) and drug-eluting stents (DES) at day 7 after fabrication. TEBVs were dynamically conditioned in a bioreactor for 21 days in total and monitored by optical coherence tomography. Results: TEBVs with absent or incomplete endothelial layer exhibited thicker vessel walls, more disorganized and misaligned collagen, and increased cellular proliferation compared with completely endothelialized TEBVs. POBA and stent implantation were feasible 7 days after TEBV fabrication. At 14 days post-intervention, POBA-treated TEBVs exhibited significantly thicker vessel walls than untreated controls and stented TEBVs, whereas stented TEBVs showed greater lumen diameters than unstented TEBVs. Endothelial strut coverage was significantly higher in BMS-treated compared with DES-treated TEBVs. Over the course of the conditioning period, levels of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 were highest in medium samples from BMS-treated TEBVs compared to DES-treated TEBVs and compared to untreated controls. Conclusions: TEBVs are a promising approach towards an in vitro system for the study of intimal hyperplasia.

In type 2 RCD (RCD2), the lack of response to the gluten-free diet is attributed to an intestinal intraepithelial lymphoma carrying driver JAK1 or STAT3 mutations. However, it remains unclear whether these can be safely targeted for therapy. In RCD1, pathogenic insights are still lacking. Methods: Duodenal biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with RCD1, RCD2, active CeD, CeD in remission, and controls were analyzed. Lymphocyte populations were characterized using single-cell transcriptomic, genomic, and TCR repertoire profiling. Functional and exome sequencing analyses were performed on patient-derived RCD2 cell lines exposed to JAK inhibitors. Results: We show that clonal malignant RCD2 lymphocytes exhibit interpatient similarities but substantial intratumoral heterogeneity, and provide in vitro evidence that JAK inhibitors can select drug-resistant tumor cells, arguing against their use as monotherapy. In RCD1, we identified clonal T-cell expansions harboring mutations that enhance the JAK-STAT pathway. The detection of both RCD2 and a CD4 lymphoproliferation in a patient initially diagnosed with RCD1 further illustrates the diversity of lymphoproliferative outcomes in celiac disease.

However, downy mildew disease limits productivity and production of onion in onion growing-regions. Thus, this survey was conducted to assess the distribution and intensity of onion downy mildew and determine the associations of disease parameters with biophysical factors. During the 2024/2025 onion cropping season, 130 onion fields were surveyed in order to measure biophysical and disease data. The associations of disease parameters and biophysical factors were analyzed using the binary logistic regression model by employing the SAS GENEMODE procedure. The survey's findings verified that downy mildew was 100% prevalent. The highest disease intensity was assessed from Fogera (50.68% and 23.48%) and Libokemkem (45.16% and 21.62%) districts, respectively. High disease incidence (>40%) and severity (>20%) were strongly associated with maturity crop growth stages, field size (>0.25 ha), blub previous crop, late October transplanting, less than four times fungicide application and less than three times land preparation. Lower disease incidence ([&le;] 40%) and severity ([&le;] 20%) had a strong association with early December transplanting, more than three times land preparation, fungicide spray (>4 times), field size ([&le;] 0.25 ha), fields previously planted with cereals, could be considered as relative management options to minimize the disease's effects in onion growing areas of northwest Ethiopia and other similar onion cultivating areas.

In mammals, neurogenic capacity is inherently limited and declines further with age. In contrast, the young adult killifish demonstrates a remarkable ability to regenerate neurons in the telencephalon following TBI. However, it remains unknown whether and when these newly generated neurons functionally integrate into existing circuits, as traditional histological analysis of fixed tissue offers only static insights into this dynamic process. To this end, we optimized a retroviral vector strategy to label dividing stem cells and their progeny, including newborn neurons. By introducing a combination of novel approaches i.e., retroviral vector labeling, electrophysiology and a conditioned place avoidance test, we investigated the generation, morphology, and synaptic integration of newborn neurons following TBI in the dorsomedial (Dm) zone of the telencephalon, a region homologous to the mammalian amygdala in other teleost fish. Our results show that injury-induced adult-born neurons functionally integrate into existing circuits, and that killifish can achieve functional behavioral recovery after TBI. While previous histological assessments using a stab-wound injury suggested a 30-day recovery period, our functional data reveal that full behavioral recovery requires approximately 50 days. At this point, fish successfully relearn to avoid a conditioned place, and the new neurons exhibit mature morpho-electric characteristics, including abundant dendritic spines. Electrophysiological analysis revealed that newborn neurons in an injured environment take longer to mature when compared to neurons in naive killifish. Together, our findings demonstrate that structural regeneration aligns with functional recovery, and establish retroviral vectors as a powerful tool for birth dating injury-induced neurogenesis in teleosts. Killifish thus represent a promising model for studying interventions aimed at enhancing neuronal maturation and integration after brain injury.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Using a panel of BSL2-safe reassortant viruses representing clade 2.3.4.4b H5 epizootic lineages circulating since 2020, we found that a cow B3.13 isolate displayed enhanced replication in cow mammary gland cells, along with increased viral polymerase activity and stronger interferon antagonism in cow cells compared to an earlier EA-2020-C genotype virus. However, multiple avian and mammalian IAV strains, including other clade 2.3.4.4b high pathogenicity genotypes, were replication competent in bovine cells, particularly those of the mammary gland, suggesting that there is a diverse circulating IAV pool with the potential to infect cows. Moreover, we show that cow mammary cells co-express alpha-2,3 and alpha-2,6 - linked sialic acids, and are susceptible to co-infection with human and avian IAVs. We conclude that the US cow influenza outbreak does not simply reflect a unique adaptation of the B3.13 genotype virus; rather, the bovine udder represents a permissive niche for IAV and a plausible site for reassortment, underscoring its potential role in generating novel influenza viruses with pandemic risk.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

As P. aeruginosa is well-known for its growth phase dependent phenotypes and gene regulation, our goal was to determine how temperature altered global gene expression at exponential versus stationary phase and to characterize how growth phase affects thermoregulation. To do this, we grew PAO1 in parallel at 25{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C and sampled the same populations first at exponential phase and then again at stationary phase and assessed gene expression by RNA-sequencing. We found that temperature regulated hundreds of genes at, and unique to, exponential and stationary phase. We also grew PAO1 and an isogenic ?lasR mutant at 25{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C and sampled populations at stationary phase to define LasR-regulated genes at each temperature by RNA-sequencing. LasR regulated most of its target genes similarly at 25{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C, although we identified a subset of genes whose regulation by LasR was affected by temperature.

Barcode analysis of plasma following ART discontinuation identified 1 to 38 rebounding barcode-defined viral lineages per animal, with 1 to 4 rebounding lineages contributing to first measurable rebound viremia. Analysis of barcode viral RNA (vRNA) expression in necropsy tissues revealed presumptive anatomic origin sites for 56 of 175 total rebounding viral lineages, with significant enrichment in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and GI-associated lymph nodes. Daily transcriptomic and proteomic profiling in peripheral blood following ART discontinuation showed upregulation of pathways related to T cell signaling, cytokine responses, and cellular metabolism prior to detectable rebound viremia. These data suggest that viral rebound following ART discontinuation is initiated by local tissue replication of a limited number of clonal lineages, followed by systemic expansion of the initial rebounding lineages and serial initiation of replication of multiple additional clonal lineages. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the processes that result in viral rebound following ART discontinuation and will contribute to next generation HIV-1 cure strategies.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Our group previously showed that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) knockout (KO) male mice exhibit compensatory changes in nNOS expression in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and impaired fear extinction, suggesting that this genetic model may be relevant for studying PTSD-related phenotypes. Given the frequent comorbidity of PTSD with anxiety and depression, and the marked underrepresentation of females in neuropsychopharmacology research, we performed a behavioral characterization of male and female iNOS KO mice, focusing on aversive memory, anxiety-, and depression-like behaviors. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic behavioral study of female iNOS KO mice, which is particularly relevant given that females are twice as likely to develop psychiatric disorders. We observed that female iNOS KO mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze test (EPMT), whereas males showed antidepressant-like behavior in the forced swim test (FST). No general cognitive deficits were found in the Y-maze or object recognition (OR) tests in either sex. However, male iNOS KO mice exhibited deficits in fear extinction memory and extinction retrieval in both contextual and cued fear conditioning.

This study aimed to identify and characterize non-mammalian CXCL17 orthologs based on key features of mammalian CXCL17s, such as a C-terminal Xaa-Pro-Yaa motif, a signal peptide, and six cysteine residues. Two possible CXCL17 paralogs were identified from zebrafish (Danio rerio): Dr-CXCL17 (encoded by zgc:158701) and Dr-CXCL17-like (encoded by si:dkey-112a7.5). Both are previously uncharacterized proteins with unknown functions because they lack overall sequence similarity to known mammalian CXCL17s. For functional characterization, recombinant Dr-CXCL17 and Dr-CXCL17-like were prepared via overexpression in Escherichia coli and subsequent in vitro refolding and their activity was tested using NanoLuc Binary Technology (NanoBiT)-based {beta}-arrestin recruitment assays, NanoBiT-based ligand-receptor binding assays, and chemotaxis assays. The results showed that both Dr-CXCL17 and Dr-CXCL17-like tightly bound to and efficiently activated zebrafish GPR25 (Dr-GPR25) and induced chemotactic movement in transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells expressing the receptor. Deletion of three C-terminal residues in both paralogs almost eliminated their binding, activation, and chemotactic effects, which suggests that this fragment is crucial for their function. Homologs of Dr-CXCL17 or Dr-CXCL17-like were retrieved from several other ray-finned fish species, indicating that two CXCL17 paralogs are present in certain fish species and function as endogenous agonists for the fish GPR25 receptor. The identification of fish CXCL17 orthologs suggests that the CXCL17-GPR25 pair likely originated in ancient fishes and was conserved across vertebrate lineages.

Female and male organs deflect by a combination of genetically controlled chirality and gravitropism, orienting left and right with respect to an external rather than internal reference axis. Coordinated organ placement is controlled by a hemizygous supergene containing two causal loci, MIR156-R and YUCCA-R, responsible for opposite female and male organ orientation, respectively.

Consequently, roots absorb this metal from soil solution, arresting their growth while reducing water and nutrient uptake. To mitigate the impacts of Al, plants rewire their metabolism and growth, with diverse mechanisms in this process shaped by changes in auxin signalling. Here, we present a comprehensive study on the significance of auxin signalling for Al tolerance. We used tomato mutants with reduced (diageotropica, dgt) and increased (entire) auxin sensitivity to assess the regulation of growth and metabolism in plants coping with Al toxicity. Our results indicated a reduced Al tolerance in the dgt mutant, whereas entire was able to tolerate toxic levels of Al. This contrast can be explained by a differential accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the root transition zone, where dgt exhibited more differentiated cells, making the pericycle evident. In contrast, entire showed only slight alterations in the transition zone, with root meristematic cells maintaining a reduced level of cell differentiation, which can be associated with sustained growth under toxic Al levels. These differences were followed by alterations in metabolites related to Al sensitivity in the roots of dgt plants, whereas the entire mutant exhibited only slight metabolic changes. Collectively, our results suggest that genetic modifications to regulate auxin perception have the potential to increase Al tolerance in crops.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Invasive species are able to colonise new environments rapidly due to their phenotypic plasticity. Ludwigia grandiflora subsp. hexapetala (Lgh), an aquatic invasive plant, invades various aquatic habitats, such as rivers, ponds, and more recently, especially in France, wet meadows. More recently, a terrestrial morphotype, emergent for half the year, has been identified. The behaviour of aquatic and terrestrial morphotypes in aquatic and terrestrial conditions was analysed through observations of morphological traits, and assays of metabolomics and phytohormones 14 and 28 days after the beginning of the experiment. The phenotypic plasticity was evaluated by calculating the relative distance plasticity index (RDPI) in response to environmental changes (terrestrial versus aquatic). RDPI were measured for morphological traits, metabolic and phytohormonal contents. Our results revealed that the terrestrial morphotype showed higher morphological trait values than the aquatic morphotype, independently of conditions, suggesting a pre-adaptation of Lgh to terrestrial habitats. The aquatic and terrestrial conditions shaped the Lgh metabolomic responses. However, the aquatic morphotype displayed higher phenotypic plasticity indexes than the terrestrial one. In addition, plasticity indexes evolved during the acclimatisation process, leading to increased RPDI values in most cases. The two morphotypes present distinct responses to aquatic and terrestrial conditions (especially in aquatic conditions for the terrestrial morphotype), highlighting the capacity of Lgh for invading new habitats due to its phenotypic plasticity, and a potential local adaptation. This study contributed to the understanding of how invasive species mobilise their phenotypic plasticity in new habitats, and the time required for local adaptation to occur.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Using seven individuals spanning a range of body sizes from the Santa Barbara Channel, California, we found standing genetic variation levels similar to related species and a relatively small effective population size. CpG methylation was enriched in gene bodies, and gene body methylation was positively associated with expression. Promoter methylation was less frequent but showed a strong negative association with expression and remained the best predictor of repression after accounting for gene body methylation, aligning with patterns widely documented in vertebrates and adding to the limited evidence in invertebrates that promoter methylation can be regulatory.

It is assumed that incubating birds follow a classical framework in which the environmental temperature, the main variable influencing incubation behaviour, and bout duration show a non-linear relationship. In this context, incubating birds would maximize bout duration for most of the temperature range in which they breed. To determine whether this theoretical framework applies to species breeding at different latitudes under extremely different environmental conditions, we collected incubation data from two distant but breeding populations of Tachycineta swallows. T. leucopyga (Chillean swallow) breeds in Ushuaia, Argentina, and T. meyeni (mangrove swallow) breeds in Hill Bank, Belize. These populations do not overlap in terms of ambient temperature; they are exposed to different daylight conditions and the latitudinal differences influence life-history traits such as clutch size. Tachycineta swallows showed similar incubation consistency over 24 hours (~75% of nest attendance) but followed different behavioral strategies to achieve this consistency. Daylight duration limited incubation activity in mangrove swallows, but longer nocturnal incubation compensated for shorter days. Larger clutches only took their toll on the Chilean swallows, by shortening their incubation bouts and lengthening their foraging bouts, which affected the length of their daily activity. Overall, both swallow species showed incubation patterns adapted to the local conditions. They responded differently to increasing temperatures, but both species reduced their incubation effort whenever possible. Our results contrast with previous work where maximizing incubation effort was the rule. In our populations, females reduced their incubation effort as soon as weather conditions improved (i.e., increasing temperatures), changing the paradigm of incubation behaviour.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

However, the precise biological implications of these jet-like structures are unknown due to the limitations in computational methods. We developed MIA-Jet, a multi-scale ridge detection algorithm that can accurately detect jets of variable lengths, widths, and angles. When tested on Hi-C, Repli-HiC, ChIA-PET, ChIA-Drop, and Micro-C data in mouse, human, roundworm, and zebrafish cells, MIA-Jet outperformed existing methods. In human cells, jets were enriched in cohesin loading sites and early replication initiation zones. Applying MIA-Jet to Hi-C data generated from protein-degraded cells revealed that jets are dependent on cohesin but not YY1, and jet signals are strengthened after depleting WAPL. We envision MIA-Jet to be broadly applicable to any 3D genome mapping data, thereby providing new insights into the functional roles of chromatin jets.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

TIPP-SD uses a modified version of TIPP3, which is a recently developed abundance profiling tool based on maximum likelihood phylogenetic placement into marker gene taxonomies. TIPP-SD depends on a parameter (i.e., threshold) for the required support for species detection, thus allowing us to compute a precision-recall curve as we vary this parameter. In comparing the precision-recall curves for TIPP-SD, TIPP3, Kraken2, Bracken, and Metapresence, we find that TIPP-SD improves on the other methods with respect to accuracy under conditions where some species occur in low abundance, or where there is sequencing error. Under easier conditions, TIPP-SD is close to the best of these methods. Finally, although TIPP-SD is slower than Kraken2 and Bracken, it is still fast enough to be used on large datasets.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

To ensure cross-sample comparability, we applied batch correction, while spatial cell deconvolution uncovered cell-type-specific dynamics and interactions. In triple-negative breast cancer, integrated spatial and single-cell analyses identified TSPAN8-positive epithelial subpopulations whose distinct APA regulation and transcriptional programs drive differentiation and malignant progression. To facilitate community access, we developed an online platform (http://www.biomedical-web.com/spatialAPAdb/home) for exploring APA, gene expression, and cellular dynamics in health and disease.

In contemporary workflows, most binning tools begin with the assembly of shotgun metagenomic sequencing data. The assembled contigs are then grouped into bins representing individual microbial genomes or species, typically using taxonomy-independent methods. Although several methods exist, metagenomic binning remains a challenging yet mandatory task, particularly in the context of complex and highly diverse microbial communities. Results: We propose CoCoBin, a novel metagenomic binning tool explicitly designed for the effective binning of metagenomic contigs. In this study, we introduced an innovative approach for calculating contig similarity by separating composition and coverage information. The method begins by (1) assigning contigs into a cluster based on length ranges, (2) calculating contig similarity based on composition features (e.g., k-mer frequencies), and (3) calculating contig difference based on coverage features. These similarity measures are then integrated to construct a graph, where nodes represent contigs and edges represent the similarities between them. Finally, the Louvain algorithm is applied to the graph to cluster closely related contigs. CoCoBin was compared against several state-of-the-art binning tools: BusyBee Web, CONCOCT, MaxBin 2.0, MetaBAT 2, and MetaDecoder on nine simulated datasets, five mock community datasets, and one real dataset. The AMBER tool used to evaluate the binning results across all datasets shows that CoCoBin achieved the best performance regarding the number of bins identified, followed by its performance on the F1 score.

The molecular characteristics and evidence-based therapeutic strategies of EACSCC still remain to be elucidated. Experimental Design: Comprehensive analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) utilizing YAP and H3K27Ac antibodies were performed in primary EACSCC and noncancerous ear skin samples. Functional experiments were performed in EACSCC-derived cells and Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) cells in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical staining of primary EACSCC tissues as well as survival analysis were conducted. Results: RNA-seq indicated hyperactivation of YAP/TEAD-mediated transcriptional programs in EACSCC. H3K27Ac ChIP-seq suggested gained accessibility for transcription factor (TF) binding sites for TEAD, AP-1 and PITX TFs in EACSCC, and presence of EACSCC-specific super enhancers (SEs). YAP-bound SEs were involved in oncogenic transcription, including EGFR signaling. Small molecule TEAD inhibitor (smTEADi) VT104 showed significant suppression of proliferation and clonogenicity in EACSCC cells. Importantly, smTEADi not only inhibited YAP-TEAD interaction but also induced YAP-PITX2 binding, suggesting that PITX2 could represent an alternative partner TF of YAP under TEAD-inhibited conditions. Knockdown of PITX2 inhibited cell growth and migration of EACSCC and HNSCC cells, whereas overexpression of PITX2 induced expression of cell cycle, stemness, and EMT genes, as well as YAP/TAZ-TEAD target genes, and promoted tumor growth in vivo. Nuclear YAP and PITX2 expression were significantly correlated with poor prognosis of EACSCC patients. Conclusions: This study highlighted the hyperactivation of the YAP-TEAD/PITX2 transcriptional program and its potential as a therapeutic target in EACSCC.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Treatment of B16F10 tumors not expressing VEGF-C with either virus led to tumor growth delay, and complete responses were rare. In contrast, when tumors expressed VEGF-C, viral therapy led to complete remission and long-term immunological memory in most mice. Upon re-challenge, most mice remained tumor- and metastasis-free for over 18 months, indicating durable immunity. VEGF-C induced tumor lymphangiogenesis, which correlated with high CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell densities in proximity of lymphatic vessels.

Despite extensive research, dynamic molecular changes and conserved versus organ-specific transcriptional programs in hypertensive multi-organ damage remain poorly understood. Defining complex molecular pathways both in a temporal sequence and in an organ-specific manner is essential for developing targeted, precision therapies to mitigate hypertensive disease burden. METHODS: We generated a longitudinal multi-organ transcriptomic atlas of salt-sensitive hypertension using RNA sequencing of kidney cortex, kidney medulla, heart, and liver from Dahl salt-sensitive rats across four disease stages. A comprehensive bioinformatic analysis mapped dynamic transcriptional programs, evaluated 50 biological pathways, and defined upstream regulators. Histological and biochemical assays complemented transcriptomic analysis, while integration with human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and compound transcriptome analysis provided translational insights and identified candidate therapeutics. RESULTS: Salt-induced hypertension elicited both shared and tissue-specific transcriptional programs that evolved with disease progression. The kidney medulla showed robust early immune activation with metabolic suppression, while the cortex exhibited transient metabolic activation before declining and initiating immune activation. The liver and heart showed time-dependent metabolic and inflammatory remodeling. Cross-organ comparisons revealed a shared early proliferative response that converged on proinflammatory and fibrotic signatures. Upstream regulator analysis identified 79 time- and tissue-specific transcription factors associated with gene expression dynamics. GWAS integration analysis revealed endocrine signaling, ion transport, lipid metabolism, and detoxification as conserved pathways across species, underscoring the translational relevance of the model and study. Predictive compound transcriptome analyses identified kinase inhibitors targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinase, mechanistic target of rapamycin and cyclin-dependent kinases as top candidates to counteract maladaptive transcriptional programs.

Broadly speaking, two designs of antennae coexist in Lepidoptera: complex (pectinate) or stick-like (filiform) ones. Pectinate antennae have attracted attention because of their multiscale geometry, assumed to outperform filiform. Yet, the filiform design is by far more common. We compare the olfactory performance of the two designs using modeling, particle image velocimetry on 3D-printed scaled-up models, and computational simulations. In terms of absolute odor capture, pectinate antennae perform better at nearly all flying speeds. However, when considering drag, filiform designs are more energy-efficient than pectinate ones at low flight speeds, while the reverse holds at high speeds. This is due to the differential scaling of drag and molecule capture with flight speed. According to our results, small and slow moths would bear filiform antennae whereas big and fast moths would have pectinate ones, which is the general trend observed in Nature. We discuss exceptions to this general pattern and how species could evolve from one design to the other by investigating the influence of the antennal structural elements.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

The identity of Wf has remained unclear despite several candidates have been proposed. Here we identified Wf by fine mapping of a segregating population derived from the white-fleshed variety Piel de Sapo (PS, gf gf / Wf Wf) and the orange-fleshed Vedrantais (VED, Gf Gf / wf wf). Wf corresponds to the gene MELO3C003098, herein referred to as CmRPGE1 as it encodes a fruit-specific homologue of REPRESSOR OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC GENES (RPGE) microproteins. Similar to RPGE homologues from other plants, overexpression of the PS allele (CmRPGE1PS) caused a pale green leaf phenotype in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana. By contrast, a 10-nucleotide deletion in the VED allele (CmRPGE1VED) resulted in a loss of RPGE function. The active CmRPGE1PS microprotein interacts with a fruit-localized melon homologue of ARABIDOPSIS PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR2 (APRR2), a GARP family transcription factor. Binding of CmRPGE1PS retains the melon APRR2 homologue in the cytosol, hence preventing the regulation of target genes involved in chloroplast biogenesis.

An exception was found in European pear 'Bartlett,' which showed relatively vigorous growth in the distal region, explaining its distinct shape with expanded distal end. Transverse expansion varied far less than longitudinal expansion, with a possible association with initial fruit morphology. Inter-fruit growth variability peaked in the fastest-growing regions, particularly in the distal area of the European pear, highlighting the link between growth vigor and phenotypic variance.

Introducing a rapid ATP-ADP exchange reaction prevented this ATP/ADP ratio surge and sustained high ATP production efficiency across temperatures. Furthermore, altering enzyme abundances similarly maintained high ATP production, with predicted enzyme regulation aligning with experimental observations in E. coli at low temperatures.

Our comparably large fMRI study (n = 142) therefore aimed to systematically determine how trait disgust modulates neural responses to carefully selected and validated disgust-specific visual stimuli across varying levels of subjective disgust experience. The whole-brain voxel-wise regression analyses revealed a neural dissociation between the two disgust traits, with disgust propensity, but not disgust sensitivity, modulating disgust-related neural activity in the anterior, middle, and posterior insula, as well as the caudate, putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Mediation and network-level analyses further supported this dissociation by showing that disgust propensity shapes disgust experience via insula-striatal-hippocampal pathways. Together, these findings provide evidence for a neurofunctional dissociation of disgust propensity and sensitivity and elucidate how trait disgust shapes subjective experiences.

While some neural manifolds are linear and can be recovered from population activity using standard techniques, many neural manifolds exhibit nonlinear global topology for which such tools can be less effective. Notably, circular and toroidal manifolds describe activity in neural systems across a range of species; common examples include orientation-selective simple cells in primary visual cortex, head-direction cells in thalamic circuits, and grid cells in entorhinal cortex. That such structured information appears in both sensory and deep-brain regions raises a basic question: is the propagation of nonlinear coordinate systems a generic feature of biological neural networks, or must this be learned? If learning is necessary, how does it occur? In this paper, we apply methods from topological data analysis developed to quantitatively measure propagation of such nonlinear manifolds across populations to address these problems. We identify a collection of connectivity and parameter regimes for feed-forward networks in which learning is required, and demonstrate that simple Hebbian spike-timing dependent plasticity reorganizes such networks to correctly propagate circular coordinate systems. We observe during this learning process the emergence of geometrically non-local experimentally observed receptive field types: bimodally-tuned head-direction cells and cells with spatially periodic, band-like receptive fields. These observations provide quantitative support for the hypothesis that simple biologically plausible plasticity mechanisms suffice to induce changes in the structure of neural architectures sufficient to explain the appearance of such features in real neural systems.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

It enhances visual sensitivity in the vicinity of the salient stimulus, both in extrafoveal regions and within the high-acuity foveola. While the spatial frequencies modulated by exogenous attention in extrafoveal vision are well characterized, it remains unknown how this mechanism operates within the foveola, which can resolve spatial frequencies up to 30 cycles per degree (CPD). Here, we examined which spatial frequencies were enhanced by fine-grained deployments of exogenous attention within this highest-acuity region of the visual field. Using high-precision eye-tracking and gaze-contingent display control to precisely localize gaze during attentional allocation, we found that exogenous attention at the foveal scale selectively enhances contrast sensitivity for low- to mid-range spatial frequencies (4-8 CPD), with no significant benefits for higher spatial frequencies (12-20 CPD). In contrast, attention-related benefits on asymptotic performance at the highest contrast were observed across a wide range of spatial frequencies. These results indicate that, despite the high-resolution capacity of the foveola, exogenous attention remains an inflexible mechanism that, even at this scale, selectively enhances contrast gain for lower spatial frequencies-mirroring its behavior in extrafoveal vision.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Both operator experience and subject head shape variability can affect placement accuracy. Aim: We aim to develop an easy-to-use software, NeuroNavigatAR (NNAR), utilizing augmented reality (AR) and machine-learning to estimate and display in real-time the subject's cranial and head landmarks to guide consistent headgear placement. Approach: By applying a facial recognition toolbox to the image frames extracted from a video camera, we can obtain and continuously track subject-specific three-dimensional (3-D) facial landmarks. Separately, we have precomputed a robust linear transformation between facial landmarks and key cranial landmarks, including nasion and preauricular points, using a large public head-model library consisting of over 1,000 subjects. These allow us to rapidly estimate subject-specific cranial landmarks and subsequently render atlas-derived head landmarks to the subject's camera stream. Results: An open-source graphical user interface implementing this AR system has achieved a speed of 15 frame-per-second using a laptop. A median 10-20 position error of 1.52 cm was found when using a general adult atlas, and is further reduced to 1.33 cm and 0.75 cm when using age-matched atlas models and subject-specific head surfaces, respectively. NNAR demonstrated consistent head-landmark prediction errors across repeated measurement sessions; there is also no statistically significant difference in accuracy across age groups. Conclusions: NNAR is an easy-to-use AR headgear placement monitoring tool that is expected to significantly enhance consistency and reduce setup time for fNIRS and EEG probe donning across a wide range of studies.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

M.; Ramaswami, B.; Gierlack, S.; Pease, N. A.; Rothstein, D.; Singh, H.", "abstract": "Extensive studies have delineated signaling systems and transcription factors (TFs) that positively regulate germinal center (GC) B cell responses. In the light zone (LZ), T follicular helper (Tfh) derived CD40L and ICOS along with B cell receptor (BCR) signals license B cell clones to pass through the G1-S checkpoint; the cells then re-enter the dark zone (DZ) for clonal expansion and AID mediated hypermutation. In contrast, only one signaling-induced negative regulator of the GC response that restricts clonal dominance has been identified, notably Nr4a1 (NUR77). We posited that PRDM1 (BLIMP1) which promotes exit of GC B cells into the plasma cell (PC) pathway, could also act as a signaling-induced transient feedback gate to restrain the GC B cell response, thereby reducing clonal dominance. In keeping with this hypothesis, low and heterogenous expression of PRDM1 has been reported in GC B cells and its loss has been shown to result in larger GCs. Using single-cell (sc) transcriptome, V(D)J and chromatin profiling coupled with single nucleotide-resolution accessibility modeling of regulatory DNA sequences, we show that Prdm1-deficient B cells mount an exaggerated GC reaction characterized by larger clone sizes and enhanced affinity maturation culminating in greater clonal dominance. This phenotype is not attributable merely to impaired exit of GC B cells into the PC pathway. Rather, integrated genomic analyses indicate that PRDM1 constrains expression of genes encoding components of the BCR-signaling cascade. Loss of this feedback augments chromatin engagement of signaling-inducible TFs at ISRE, EICE, NF-KB and POU (Oct) motifs, promoting the G1/S transition during LZ selection and fueling DZ expansion.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Coloration serves multiple functions, and determining the selective pressures that drive this diversity is a long-standing mystery. Clownfishes display enormous inter- and intra-specific variation in coloration without the influence of sexual selection, providing an excellent system in which to explore these drivers in closely related and sympatric species. Across clownfishes, three color-pattern phenotypes have evolved convergently with host anemone use, implying adaptive functions linked to the host's physical and chemical properties. Here we conducted a comprehensive study to infer the ultimate functions of clownfish color patterns. By integrating multiple levels of biological organization, including behavior, visual ecology, dietary niche, and microbiome, our data overwhelmingly indicate that specialist and generalist clownfish color patterns have different underlying ecologies and adaptive functions. Specialist clownfishes background match their anemones, remain near hosts, and have specialized diets and microbiomes. Generalists are highly contrasting with their anemones, remain far from hosts, and have variable diets and microbiomes. Taken together, specialist color patterns align with functional expectations of camouflage while generalists align with aposematic or disruptive coloration. Our study provides novel insights into how ecological conditions shape the evolution of multiple anti-predator coloration strategies.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we investigate the evolutionary emergence of chemosymbiosis in the shrimp family Alvinocarididae across 22 species collected globally. Electron microscopy identified a gradient of epibiotic bacterial colonization within the cephalothoracic cavity, ranging from absent to dense filamentous mats, suggesting distinct trophic strategies. Isotope and lipid trophic markers confirmed difference in reliance on chemosynthetic production among sympatric species with different bacterial colonization from a single vent. Phylogenetic analysis reveals at least two independent origins of chemosymbiosis, suggesting evolutionary convergence. Microhabitat association data further show that symbiotic phenotypes are most common in shrimps occupying the hottest, most geofluid-enriched microhabitats, though exceptions suggest contributions from additional ecological or physiological constraints. Our findings reveal many alvinocaridids as gradually evolving towards symbiosis, highlighting the importance of intermediate cases to understand the pathways to chemosymbiosis.

Recent research has demonstrated cultural learning in a growing diversity of species (3,4), but has largely been studied through mere snapshots of animals' lives and specific behavioural achievements like tool use (5,6). Thus, how different forms of learning interact to shape the full arc of individuals' behavioural development in the wild remains unknown. Here, we analyse nearly seven thousand records of behavioural indicators of social and asocial learning in wild, immature orangutans, from birth to independence at around eight years. We show that learning is largely triggered by social observation, the effect of which lasts for hours. Social learning events were five times more frequent than asocial learning events. Immatures show substantial differences in their reliance on different forms of social and asocial learning during development. We demonstrate that individuals with the highest rates in both modes of learning developed the broadest diets, and the benefits of social learning were the strongest when asocial learning was low. Extending to over 250 food items in adults, diet breadth represents a comprehensive measure of ecological competence, rather than reflecting mastery of a single behaviour. Our detailed analyses reveal that social and asocial learning synergistically shape great ape ecological competence substantially more than previously recognised. Our study marks a step-change in methodological approaches concerning both the scale of cultural and asocial learning across development and its impacts on broad-scale competences critical for later life. It offers a launching point for both the focused investigation of individual-specific learning trajectories shaping development, and the interaction between social and asocial learning in progressing toward adult-like repertoires in non-human wild animals and humans alike.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

We previously showed hypoxia-regulated E3 ligase WSB-1s association with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Here, we evaluated the role of WSB-1 in DNA repair regulation in breast cancer, and whether these phenotypes can be exploited therapeutically. WSB-1 knockdown led to transcriptome-wide DNA repair factor upregulation, including homologous recombination (HR) factors BRCA1and RAD51. Reciprocally, WSB-1 overexpression led to downregulation of these repair factors and decreased DNA repair capacity. Patient gene expression datasets analyses also showed an inverse correlation between WSB1 expression vs DNA repair and HR pathways. HR-deficient cancers, including BRCA1/2-deficient breast cancers, are extremely sensitive to PARP inhibitors, a phenotype described as BRCAness. We therefore hypothesised if high WSB-1 expression could be similarly exploited therapeutically. WSB-1 overexpression alone radiosensitised cells and led to increased Olaparib (PARP inhibitor) and Berzosertib (ATR inhibitor) sensitivity in vitro. Our study indicates that WSB-1 expression in breast cancer is associated with modulation of HR factor expression, and we propose that elevated WSB-1 expression could be considered as a potential BRCAness biomarker and promote increased sensitivity to DNA repair targeted therapy in these patients.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

However, strategies to restore this pathway through diet or microbial modulation remain poorly defined. This study investigates how dietary tryptophan and human and mouse microbiota modulate metabolism, AhR activation, and intestinal inflammation in preclinical models. Methods: Gnotobiotic mice colonized with microbiota of varying complexity or human fecal microbiota from ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and healthy controls were used to assess the impact of microbiota and dietary tryptophan supplementation on AhR activation and colitis severity. Chemically induced and spontaneous colitis models were investigated. Results: IBD fecal samples showed reduced AhR activation compared to healthy controls, and fecal microbiota transplantation into germ-free mice demonstrated that impaired AhR is microbiota-dependent. Mice colonized with minimal microbiota had impaired microbial tryptophan metabolism, lower AhR activation, and worsened colitis severity compared to those colonized with complex microbiota. Dietary tryptophan supplementation in conventional and UC-humanized mice enhanced microbial production of AhR agonists, restored AhR activation, and reduced colitis severity in an AhR-dependent manner. Co-colonization with a tryptophan-metabolizing bacterium, Clostridium sporogenes, further improved tryptophan metabolism and colitis severity in mice with impaired microbial tryptophan metabolism. Conclusions: Microbial tryptophan metabolism is critical for determining intestinal inflammation. Dietary tryptophan supplementation restores microbial metabolic pathways, mitigates colitis severity in preclinical models, and may address key metabolic deficiencies in IBD patients with impaired tryptophan metabolism.

TIMD4+ VCAM1+ CX3CR1- TMs were enriched for phagocytic and apoptotic cell-clearance pathways, whereas TIMD4- VCAM1+ CX3CR1+ TMs exhibited elevated expression of antigen-presentation machinery and interferon-response genes. Pseudotime trajectory analysis indicated a potential lineage progression from TIMD4- VCAM1+ CX3CR1+ precursors toward TIMD4+ VCAM1+ CX3CR1- effectors. Functional interrogation using fetal thymic organ cultures and the MaFIA depletion mouse model demonstrated that acute loss of TMs severely impaired thymocyte development, particularly at the pre-T cell receptor (TCR) {beta}-selection checkpoint. TM ablation led to marked reductions in post-{beta}-selection thymocyte subsets, implicating TMs in both survival and differentiation signals required for early T cell development. Mechanistically, TM depletion disrupted pre-TCR signaling and hindered transition through {beta}-selection, likely due to absence of both apoptotic-cell clearance and differentiation cues provided by specialized TM subsets. These findings define two distinct TM populations and establish their role in orchestrating thymocyte maturation. By elucidating TM subset specialization and their dynamic contributions to the {beta}-selection process, our findings advance our understanding of thymic microenvironment interactions and highlights macrophage heterogeneity as a key regulator of T cell development.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

In this study, we used atomic force microscopy in combination with biochemical assay to investigate the formation of FUS compartments under activation of PARP1 and PARP2, when HPF1 modulates their activity. Similar to PARP1, FUS and PARylated PARP2 form DNA-rich compartments, indicating that PARP2 PARylation is sufficient for the formation of such compartments. The excess of HPF1 over PARP1 diminishes PARP1 activity and reduces the size of DNA-rich compartments. However, an excess of HPF1 over PARP2 does not significantly affect PARP2 activity and the size of compartments. Furthermore, HPF1 stimulates hetero-PARylation of FUS; this modification is stronger with PARP2 than with PARP1.

Here, we combined in utero electroporation with scDam&T-seq to jointly profile genome-lamina contacts and transcriptomes in single cells of the mouse embryonic cortex. Interestingly, we find extensive genome-lamina reorganization during corticogenesis that is strongly biased towards long neuronal genes (>100 kb), which are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders including autism spectrum disorder. Detachment of these genes frequently precedes transcriptional activation, positioning lamina disengagement as an early gene regulatory event. We identify the methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) - mutated in Rett syndrome - as a candidate mediator of this process. MeCP2 binds lamina-associated, hydroxymethylated long genes before their repositioning, suggesting that MeCP2 may play a role in genome-lamina reorganization.

Several lysine methyltransferases which methylate non-histone substrates are overexpressed in a number of cancers and are believed to be key drivers of cancer progression. There is great incentive to identify the lysine methylome, as this is a key step in identifying drug targets. While numerous computational models have been developed in the last decade to identify novel lysine methylation sites, the accuracy of these model has been modest, leaving much room for improvement.

Comparing inbred and outbred lines allows for direct testing of the standard model by contrasting the magnitude of among-individual variation in a uniform versus varied genetic background. We found substantial and significant differences in among-individual variances, with among-individual variances being roughly three times greater in outbred versus inbred crickets (posterior probability, p = 0.974).

Despite extensive research, the mutations impact on myosin contractile properties remains unclear, likely due, at least in part, to discrepancies cross different model systems. In this study, we used a multidisciplinary approach to explore mutational effects using two distinct heterozygous R403Q systems: a Yucatan minipig model and human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). X-ray diffraction of R403Q minipig ventricular muscle demonstrated reduced order of the thick filament, suggesting destabilization of the inhibited OFF (vs. ON) state of myosin in relaxed muscle, which correlated with elevated force at submaximal calcium. Super-resolution, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy indicated elevated ATPase activity in thick filament zones lacking cMyBP-C. Furthermore, R403Q myofibrils exhibited slower activation and relaxation kinetics, with reduced sensitivity to ADP. Molecular dynamics simulations suggested that altered interactions at the actomyosin interface contribute to these effects, rather than changes at the nucleotide binding pocket, typically associated with ADP release. Human engineered heterozygous R403Q hiPSC-CMs exhibited reduced maximal myofibril force, slowed contractile kinetics, and hypercontraction in engineered heart tissue constructs,consistent with HCM phenotypes observed in the heterozygous porcine model. Our results demonstrate that the R403Q mutation induces early and persistent contractile dysfunction, and that hypercontractility and slower contractile kinetics may result from a combination of an increased population of activated (ON) myosin heads and delayed detachment during cross-bridge cycling, respectively.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Among these, cytokines of the IL12 family have emerged as relevant regulators of immune responses and tumor biology, yet their contribution to CLL remains incompletely defined. Previous studies showed that CLL cells can acquire responsiveness to IL23 after T cell dependent stimulation with CD40L, raising the question of whether T cell independent signals can similarly induce functional receptor expression. Here we investigated the effect of CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, alone or in combination with interleukin-15 (IL15), on IL12 family receptor expression in CLL cells. We found that CpG + IL15 stimulation significantly increased IL23R and IL12Rbeta1 expression, while IL12Rbeta2 remained largely unresponsive. As a consequence, the complete IL23 receptor complex was robustly induced, whereas IL12 receptor assembly was only marginally enhanced. This skewing toward IL23 rather than IL12 signaling suggests that innate immune stimuli preferentially promote pathways supporting inflammation and survival, while limiting tumor-suppressive IL12 responsiveness. Analysis of intraclonal heterogeneity revealed an asymmetric distribution of IL23R among CXCR4/CD5 defined subfractions: the proliferative fraction, representing recently divided cells, expressed higher levels of IL23R compared to the resting fraction. These findings suggest that IL23 responsiveness is particularly enriched in the proliferating compartment of the leukemic clone. Overall, our results indicate that CpG and IL15 stimulation drive a selective expansion of IL23 signaling capacity in CLL, with preferential engagement of proliferative subfractions. This imbalance between IL23 activation and insufficient IL12Rbeta2 induction may represent a critical pathogenic mechanism and a potential therapeutic target.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

NaV1.5-GX mice exhibited normal cardiac function at baseline, but acute GX drug administration caused profound conduction defects and arrhythmias. Whole-heart optical mapping revealed dose-dependent chamber-specific sensitivity to NaV1.5 inhibition, with the right ventricle (RV) being the most sensitive, followed by the left ventricle (LV), left atrium (LA), and right atrium (RA). Patch-clamp recordings of isolated cardiomyocytes with application of NaV isoform-selective inhibitors showed that NaV1.5 contributed 93% of sodium current in the LV, 81% in the RV and 78% in the LA. Non-NaV1.5 isoforms were differentially enriched across chambers: NaV1.8 in the LV, NaV1.1/1.3 in the RV, and NaV1.2/1.6/1.7 in the atria.

We sought to understand the strategies that mice use to navigate surface-bound odor cues. We presented mice with dynamic, non-repeating odor trails using a paper treadmill, and observed their behaviors as they collected rewards offered randomly along the trail. By combining high-speed videography over long distances with quantitative behavioral analyses, we find that mice rapidly learn to track odor trails persistently and precisely. Mice with a single nostril blocked can track odor trails, but with a lateral bias and lower precision than control animals. Tracking is severely impaired in animals with both nostrils intact but with interhemispheric communication disrupted by anterior commissure transection. Respiration measurements revealed that a sniff close to the trail triggers a rapid turn towards the trail, a reaction that is lost in commissure-cut animals. Importantly, trail tracking is not simply reactive but involves adaptation to and retention of a short-term memory of the trail geometry and statistics. Our results, recapitulated by a Bayesian inference model, indicate that mice combine immediate sensory information with an internal model of the odor environment to follow odor trails efficiently.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

A.; VIECHWEG, S.; BLACK, D.; MONG, J. A.", "abstract": "One in three Americans suffer from chronic sleep disorders, and women are 40% more likely than men to experience sleep disorders. This disparity emerges at puberty and is strongly associated with fluctuations in the ovarian hormone, estrogen (E2), suggesting that E2 and biological sex are a risk factor for sleep disorders. Previous work in the lab has demonstrated that E2 suppresses sleep in female rats, including in sleep deprived rats whose homeostatic need for sleep is increased. However, the specific mechanism for E2 induced decrease in sleep remains unknown. Work in the lab suggests a role for adenosine in mediating E2s sleep suppressive effects; E2 significantly increases Median Preoptic Nucleus (MnPO) extracellular adenosine and attenuates the action of specific agonists on the sleep promoting A2A-Receptor. Astrocytes represent a major source of adenosine in the CNS and have been shown to influence neuronal activity and downstream behaviors. In this project, we tested the hypothesis that astrocytes mediate E2s sleep suppressive effects. We used Gq-linked designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to evaluate the Gq pathway, which represents a core signaling mechanism in astrocyte activity. We found that, in female rats, activation of Gq signaling in astrocytes decreased sleep and inhibited homeostatic need for sleep. We further expressed the Pleckstrin Homology domain of PLC-like protein (p130PH), which has been shown to attenuate astrocyte activity and functions, in median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) astrocytes. We found that p130PH expression in MnPO astrocytes raised homeostatic sleep pressure to the same extent as 6 hours of sleep deprivation. We further report that inhibiting astrocytic function did not prevent E2s sleep suppressing effects suggesting that astrocytes may not play a role in estrogenic modulation of sleep. However, we did discover that MnPO astrocyte effects on sleep are sex-dependent. p130PH expression in MnPO astrocytes increased sleep and homeostatic sleep drive in female rats but showed a trend towards decreasing sleep and homeostatic sleep need in males. Further, while astrocyte effects on homeostatic sleep need are relegated to the dark phase in female rats, astrocytes appear to influence homeostatic sleep need in both the dark and light phase. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a sex-based difference in astrocyte effects on sleep and homeostatic sleep pressure.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

With few druggable targets validated within granulomas, it is essential to verify the effectiveness of HDT candidates identified through traditional macrophage cultures in the context of the tuberculous granuloma milieus. Bioengineering a scalable, high-throughput screening (HTS) platform that replicates the physiological microenvironments in the hallmark tubercular lesions could significantly improve the identification of relevant HDT candidates and new treatment strategies. Here, we developed a facile, HTS-compatible bioplatform that generates tuberculoma-emulating structures, following three-dimensional (3D) co-cultures of human cells and pathogenic mycobacteria. Employing high-content imaging alongside immunological and transcriptomic approaches, we demonstrated that these 3D structures exhibit classic tuberculoma attributes and develop crucial transformations. Utilizing this system, we screened antibody biosimilars and potential HDT compounds. Our findings demonstrate the versatility of system in discovering antimicrobials and HDT candidates that effectively reduce mycobacterial burdens and granuloma lesions, while elucidating their immune mechanisms within 3D milieus. Many compounds effective in two-dimensional (2D) cultures were ineffective once granulomas formed in our 3D model. Notably, several promising compounds were found to induce rapid autophagy flux, and we validated the effectiveness of one such compound, the multi-kinase inhibitor AT9283, in a mouse model.

However, these salmon populations have never been investigated in the same study. Using a suite of 93 single nucleotide polymorphism loci and samples from 42 British Isles and French rivers, we demonstrate the French and English chalk salmon to be closely related and distinct from salmon inhabiting non-chalk rivers. The identification of a small number of significant FST outliers suggests that this distinction is driven by local adaptation.

The chalk river salmon, especially those from southern England, are identified as making a significant contribution to the overall diversity of the species within the English Channel region.

The QEE allows us to tackle the complexity of population epigenetic models by reducing them to their underlying population genetic models with effective parameters. Using this technique, we show how epigenetics modifies key evolutionary parameters, such as the strength of selection and dominance, which can have drastic evolutionary consequences on mutation-selection balance. Further, we show how the QEE allows us to analytically investigate the effect of epigenetics on the probability of a population escaping extinction in a harsh environment via adaptation -- evolutionary rescue -- by altering the number of potential rescue lineages and their probability of establishing. These calculations show that whether epigenetics helps or hurts population persistence depends non-trivially on the frequency and stability of epigenetic modifications.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

A total of 106 samples of 75 patients were analyzed using bulk RNA-Seq expression profiling, immune deconvolution, and bacterial taxonomic reconstruction.

Immune deconvolution revealed an expansion of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and mast cells in GAC, correlated with higher expression levels of TGFB1 and FOXP3, while neutrophils and B cells predominated in PTT. Integrated analysis demonstrated that GAC formed dense and cohesive networks connecting pro-inflammatory bacteria, activated immune cells, and inflammatory genes such as IL1B, CXCL8, and IFNG.

In this work, we present the Swalife PromptStudio Target Identification workflow and illustrate its application to poly ADP-ribose polymerase 1 PARP1, a central regulator of DNA repair and genome integrity. Using structured prompts, we systematically explored literature, pathway databases, and genetic repositories to compile a multi-dimensional profile of PARP1. Prompt-guided mining revealed strong associations with base-excision repair, single-strand break repair, and homologous recombination pathways, positioning PARP1 as a hub in genome stability networks. Disease-mapping identified links to cancer, neurodegeneration, and ischemic injury, while variant-focused prompts highlighted replicated associations such as rs1136410 Val762Ala and the pharmacogenomic marker rs1805414. Together, these findings demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt-driven target identification in rapidly assembling actionable biological insights.

Methods: To control for repeated testing effects unrelated to hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle, a comparison group of males completed the same protocol over three equally spaced testing sessions to the females. Maximal voluntary contractions and force steadiness were assessed in the neutral and pronated forearm positions. Elbow flexion force tracking tasks were performed at 2.5, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 75% maximal voluntary contraction in both forearm positions, and force steadiness was quantified as the coefficient of variation of force. Results: Males were stronger than females (p<0.001), and maximal voluntary contractions did not differ between menstrual phases (p>0.14) or between days in males (p>0.56) in both forearm positions. There was no difference in coefficient of variation of force across sessions for the males (p<0.36). The coefficient of variation of force for all submaximal forces was significantly greater during the luteal phase compared to menses (Neutral p=0.02; Pronated p<0.05) but not the follicular phase (Neutral p=0.71; Pronated p=0.10). The coefficient of variation of force during the luteal phase in females was higher than males in both positions (p<0.02). Conclusion: These findings support previous observations that females are less steady than males for isometric steady contractions; however, this study identifies luteal specific phase effects. This underscores the importance of accounting for menstrual cycle phase when conducting sex-related comparisons.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Participants were sampled up to four times across seven tissues and fluids, generating >3,450 biospecimens with harmonised DNA methylation, metabolomics, microbiome, and immune profiling, alongside skin histology, barrier measurements, and rich clinical metadata. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset through: (i) multi-omics-wide association studies linking traits to molecular features; (ii) integrative factor modelling revealing coordinated cross-tissue signatures; (iii) epigenetic-biomarker cross-omic associations, and (iv) CpG-level variance decomposition mapping stable, individual-specific, tissue-restricted, and intervention-responsive methylation patterns. We further show that ageing-linked features are selectively malleable: highly compliant intermittent fasting participants exhibited attenuated or even age-opposing molecular trajectories within six months.

R.", "abstract": "Itch or pruritus, is a sensation that elicits scratching behaviour and is a major symptom and cause of morbidity in skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (AD), allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), prurigo nodularis (PN), and urticaria. Itch is often triggered by inflammatory stimuli in the skin including type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-13, and/or IL-31. Several therapies targeting type 2 immune pathways have been developed to treat pruritus; however, itch improvement in many patients remains to be improved. Thus, additional approaches to modulate sensory neuron activity are needed. Ex vivo or even in vitro study of the molecular mechanisms underlying primary sensory neuron activation is challenging since harvesting neurons from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in patients can only be done from cadavers. Herein, we describe rapid human sensory neurons generation (2 days to precursor cells) by in vitro differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) from simultaneous application of patterning factors with NGN2 overexpression. We show that these hiPSC-derived sensory neurons possess key characteristics of primary sensory neurons. They express key neuronal markers, such as TRKA receptors, TRPV1 and TRPA1 channels, and functionally respond to the TRPV1 agonist capsaicin. In addition, they express key type 2 cytokine receptors such as interleukin (IL)-4R and IL31-R, known to promote itch in AD and PN. Moreover, these cells are functional as our sensory neurons respond to IL-4, IL-13 and IL-31 stimulation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that our protocol generates a phenotypic profile consistent with native somatosensory neurons that can facilitate development of novel approaches to model and treat pruritic disease.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Although both humans and AIs achieve reasonable accuracy in estimating age from a person's face, performance remains imprecise, leaving substantial room for errors and biases. Drawing on principles from classical psychophysics, we demonstrate that the existing literature on age estimation suffers from a critical theoretical and methodological shortcoming, which casts doubt on established findings. We show that the conventional measure used to benchmark the accuracy of human and AI performance is fundamentally confounded by response bias. Consequently, we introduce a novel measure that eliminates this confound.

M.; Papadopouli, M.", "abstract": "Variability in single neuron responses presents a challenge in establishing reliable representations of visual stimuli essential for driving behavior. To enhance accuracy, integration of responses from multiple neurons is imperative. This study leverages simultaneous recordings from a large population (tens of hundreds) of neurons, achieved through in vivo mesoscopic 2-photon calcium imaging of the primary visual cortex (V1) in mice, under visual stimulus conditions as well as in resting state (absence of stimulus). The visual stimulus consisted of 16 distinct randomly shuffled directions of motion presented to the mice. We employed mutual information to identify neurons that contain the most significant information about the stimulus direction. As expected, neurons displaying high predictive power (HPP) in stimulus decoding exhibit elevated firing event rates during stimulus presentation. Furthermore, functional connectivity among HPP neurons during visual stimulation is denser and stronger compared to functional connectivity among other visually responsive neurons. Functional connections among HPP neurons appear to form independently of distance, suggesting a distributed yet highly coordinated network. In contrast, HPP neuronal activity and functional connectivity differed significantly at resting state. Specifically, during the resting state, HPP neurons exhibited lower event rates and functional connectivity structure that was not significantly different from that of other visually responsive neurons. This suggests that HPP neurons are less susceptible to being driven simultaneously by internal brain states in the absence of a stimulus. Finally, the tuning properties of HPP neurons were unexpectedly diverse: while some were sharply tuned, others conveyed a similar amount of mutual information, despite exhibiting much weaker tuning. This study sheds light on the organization of neuronal ensembles important for decoding visual motion direction in mouse area V1, contributing to the understanding of information processing in mouse visual cortex.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

We assess the quality and utility of the synthetic maps in two downstream tasks: sex classification and Alzheimer's disease classification. Performance comparisons between models trained on real and synthetic DTI maps demonstrate that RevGAN-generated images retain meaningful microstructural features and offer competitive accuracy, underscoring their potential for data augmentation and analysis in neuroimaging workflows.

We examined white matter microstructure and structural connectivity in TRD, focusing on the \"subjective valuation network\" (SVN), which captures motivated behavior, reward processing, and emotional regulation circuits commonly altered in depression. This allowed us to identify potential neuroimaging biomarkers associated with treatment resistance. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data were acquired from a sample of age- and gender-balanced individuals with TRD (n = 44; female = 24, male = 11, non-binary/unchecked = 7) and non-depressed controls (n = 42; female = 27, male = 12, non-binary/unchecked = 5). Tract-based spatial statistics were used to compare whole-brain white matter integrity differences between groups. Probabilistic tractography was then used to assess fractional anisotropy (FA) and white matter structural connectivity within the SVN across groups. SVN was defined a priori based on converging functional connectivity studies and included key regions such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventral striatum, and insula and their connecting white matter tracts. Additionally, correlations between clinical measures of depression severity and cognition and structural features of the network's white matter fibers (i.e., FA and structural connectivity) were explored. Results: Compared to non-depressed controls, individuals with TRD exhibited reduced FA within the left uncinate fasciculus, left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and anterior cingulum, supporting widespread white matter integrity degradations in TRD. No correlations were found between FA and depression severity, suggesting a more specific association with anhedonic features. Whole-network measures of FA and structural connectivity of the SVN did not differ between groups. However, specific subcircuits' structural connectivity within the SVN differed between groups; namely, the white matter tracts connecting the insula-vmPFC, striatum-insula, and striatum-vmPFC. Hyperconnectivity emerged for patients with TRD for tracts connecting the insula-vmPFC and striatum-vmPFC region-pairs, with hypoconnectivity observed between the striatum-insula. Exploratory analyses for the TRD group indicated the subcircuits with altered structural connectivity within the SVN correlated with depressive severity. This indicates subcircuit network alterations may associate with greater difficulty experiencing pleasure -- a core symptom of depression and a potential marker of treatment resistance. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for widespread disruption of white matter microstructure and altered structural connectivity within specific subcircuits of the SVN in TRD. These findings point to an intricate pattern of structural hyper- and hypoconnectivity within the subcircuits of the SVN which may underlie the core symptoms of TRD. The altered structural connectivity within the SVN may contribute to the pathophysiology of TRD, especially concerning the motivational and emotional deficits associated with anhedonia. Future research employing multimodal neuroimaging techniques and longitudinal designs is warranted to further elucidate the functional consequences of these structural abnormalities and their potential as predictive biomarkers for personalized treatment interventions in TRD. Specifically, investigating how these white matter alterations change with successful treatment or targeted interventions aimed at improving anhedonia could inform more effective therapies for this challenging condition.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

G.", "abstract": "Bats are a conspicuous source of zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential. A common explanation for bats being \"special\" viral reservoirs is their ability to coexist with viruses without suffering overt disease. This assumption has catalyzed extensive research into the nature of bats as viral reservoirs and aspirations to develop novel therapeutics for humans based on unique features of bat immune systems that endow bats with broad viral tolerance. Surprisingly, the ubiquitous belief that bats evolved generalized viral tolerance mechanisms derives from relatively few well studied host-virus interactions rather than comprehensive analysis of globally available data. Here, synthesizing eighty-six years of experimental infections, involving 54 viruses, 85 host species, and over 5,600 individuals, we show that viral tolerance in bats appears unexceptional, with severe disease following inoculation by taxonomically diverse viruses, including ones that are relatively benign in humans. Bats' ability to prevent or limit the extent of clinical disease was indistinguishable from rodents, another prominent zoonotic reservoir for which major life history differences were hypothesized to select for contrasting antiviral strategies. We demonstrate that infection outcomes are instead shaped by experimental design, viral host range, and evolutionary context, suggesting that bats respond to novel infections similarly to other host groups. Our results question the idea that bats possess a `one size fits all' solution wherein distinctive immune features protect against a wide variety of viruses. Instead, these features are likely to either have evolved from prolonged evolutionary interactions with specific viruses or to be evolutionarily unique but not determinants of disease outcomes across diverse viruses. Developing future biomedical translations of bat immunity and identifying life history traits which predispose host species to carry high consequence zoonoses is likely to require a nuanced understanding of specific host-virus interactions.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Cardiorenal functions were assessed three months after subtotal nephrectomy or sham operation. Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) were isolated from WT rats and incubated with or without recombinant Ngal and galectin-3 (Gal-3). Results: Cardiac function, including diastolic hemodynamics and perfusion, was less impaired in CKD Ngal KO than in CKD WT. Cardiac fibrosis was more severe in CKD WT than sham, but was blunted in CKD Ngal KO rats. Levels of Gal-3, collagen I, MCP-1 and IL-6 were high in CFs incubated with recombinant Ngal.

Its pharmacological inhibition exerts cardiac- and reno-protective benefits. Despite widespread clinical interest, reliable detection of SGLT2 protein remains challenging due to concerns regarding the specificity of available antibodies. Methods: This study assessed the specificity of eight commercially available anti-SGLT2 antibodies by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Genetically engineered Sglt2-deficient mice and rats, generated via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, were employed as definitive negative controls. Additionally, human kidney tissues, including renal cell carcinoma samples, were analyzed. Results: Among the antibodies tested, a few antibodies demonstrated robust specificity, characterized by substantial immunostaining with minimal background in wild-type kidney tissues and complete absence of staining in Sglt2-deficient samples. In renal cell carcinoma samples, a validated antibody detected SGLT2 immunostaining in proximal tubules of non-tumor regions but not in tumor areas. Subcellular localization studies revealed that SGLT2 was enriched within proximal tubular microvilli, partially overlapping with its co-factor PDZK1IP1 (MAP17). LRP2 (megalin) and NHE3 were placed at the microvillar base and did not colocalize with SGLT2. Western blotting identified a specific SGLT2 band at approximately 55 kDa in kidney lysates using several antibodies under optimized procedures. This band was shifted to approximately 45 kDa after enzymatic removal of N-linked glycans. One antibody detected a weak band at the same molecular mass even in kidney lysates from Sglt2-deficient rodents. Conclusions: Substantial variability exists in the specificity of commercially available anti-SGLT2 antibodies.

Unexpectedly, despite arising from a proximal tubule cell of origin similar to ccRCC, tRCCs display markedly distinct oncogenic programs and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. tRCCs exhibit six conserved tumor meta-programs, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition and proximal tubule identity programs whose balance is regulated by TFE3 fusion activity.

With numerous pLMs available, there is a critical need for diverse benchmarks to systematically evaluate their performance across biologically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce DARKIN, a zero-shot classification benchmark designed to assign phosphosites to understudied kinases, termed dark kinases. Kinases, which catalyze phosphorylation, are central to cellular signaling pathways. While phosphoproteomics enables the large-scale identification of phosphosites, determining the cognate kinase responsible for the phosphorylation event remains an experimental challenge. Results: In DARKIN, we prepared training, validation, and test folds that respect the zero-shot nature of this classification problem, incorporating stratification based on kinase groups and sequence similarity. We evaluated multiple pLMs using two zero-shot classifiers: a novel, training-free k-NN-based method, and a bilinear classifier. Our findings indicate that ESM, ProtT5-XL, and SaProt exhibit superior performance on this task. DARKIN provides a challenging benchmark for assessing pLM efficacy and fosters deeper exploration of under-characterized (dark) kinases by offering a biologically relevant test bed.

A detailed understanding of the strengths and limitations of each model helps ensure their optimal use. We recently developed a human lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) model using genetically engineered human bronchial epithelial cells (hBECs). These were studied through organotypic air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures and standard in vitro assays, including proliferation, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. However, we did not evaluate whether the same mutant hBECs behaved similarly in vivo, or if in vivo models offered distinct advantages. To address this, we conducted a comparative phenotypic analysis of mutant hBECs derived from the same donor in both ALI cultures and xenografts in immunocompromised mice. Both models followed a similar oncogenic trajectory, involving squamous differentiation and activation of Nrf2 and PI3K/Akt pathways, characteristic of the classical LUSC subtype. However, some transcriptomic differences related to an increase in microtubule formation and cell motility in xenografts emerged. Additionally, xenograft gene expression profiles more closely matched classical LUSC tumours than ALI cultures. Importantly, we observed spontaneous squamous differentiation in the absence of SOX2 overexpression and detected selection for NOTCH1 mutations in specific in vivo mutants. Truncation of NOTCH1 promoted squamous differentiation and suppressed mucociliary features in ALI cultures, underscoring its role as a potential LUSC driver. In summary, mutant hBECs in vitro and in vivo showed largely consistent phenotypes, validating both systems. However, in vivo models can enable the unbiased discovery of new genetic LUSC driver genes. This highlights the complementary value of integrating both model types in LUSC research.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Here we employed advanced MS-based intact glycoproteomics to explore the N-glycosylation profile of H11 antigen-an important vaccine antigen from pathogenic parasite Haemonchus contortus. We successfully identified seven glycosylated aminopeptidases carrying 19 N-glycosylation sites with 31 distinct N-glycan structures.

Our findings revealed a high degree of structural heterogeneity and abundant core fucosylation among the identified N-glycopeptides. Additionally, molecular docking studies demonstrated those IgG-recognized N-glycopeptides are situated on the protein surface or adjacent to the substrate-access channels, strongly indicating their potential as antigenic epitopes.

Thymic epithelial cells (TECs), key components of the thymic stroma, are classified into cortical (cTEC) and medullary (mTEC) lineages based on their distinct molecular, structural, transcriptional, and functional characteristics. Advances in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) have revealed significant TEC heterogeneity, including the identification of intertypical TECs that share properties of both cTEC and mTEC and have been postulated to play a role in the development and maintenance of thymic function. To date, the identity and maintenance of postnatal TEPCs remain unclear, with debates on whether bipotent TEPCs persist after birth or if lineage-restricted progenitors independently maintain TEC compartments. Using an inducible lineage-tracing system based on {beta}5t expression, we explored the early dynamics of the relationships between TEPC and mTEC progenitors and their progeny. Our results identified two potential lineage-biassed TEPC subpopulations, distinguished by Ly6d expression.

To uncover the potential function of dream emotions, we must first understand what they are and how they unfold in dreams. The emotional content of dreams has mostly been studied using post-sleep dream reports, which provide a biased and static snapshot of a complex and dynamic experience. In this study, we took a more direct approach, accessing dream emotions in real-time. We asked twenty-four lucid dreamers with narcolepsy to report the emotional valence of their dreams, - positive, negative or neutral-, while still asleep, using predefined facial codes during daytime naps monitored with polysomnography. Of the 126 naps recorded, 62 contained at least one emotional code during REM sleep, yielding 191 codes in total. The ratios of positive and negative codes were evenly balanced per nap. The 33 naps with at least two codes allowed us to track the dream emotional dynamics. Over half of these naps showed opposite emotional valences (positive and negative). By measuring the time elapsed between codes, we estimated the average duration of a given dream's emotional valence in REM sleep to be about one minute. Positive emotions emerged on average earlier than negative ones during lucid REM sleep. These findings confirm the highly emotional nature of dreams and, more importantly, highlight that emotions in REM sleep dreams are fluid and fast-changing. Such emotional dynamics during REM sleep dreams may help us to better understand the mechanisms of the emotional regulatory function of dreams.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Here, Using isogenic murine organoid models with common oncogenic drivers (Tp53-/-; Krasmut; Pten-/-), we show that disFTE and proFTE generate distinct tumor subtypes driven by region-specific transcriptional programs. Unlike disFTE, proFTE demonstrates continuous activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) across wild-type, mutant organoids, and derived tumors. Additionally, mutated proFTE organoids and their tumors exhibit persistent WNT signaling activation and grow independently of WNT signals. Chromatin profiling shows that mutant proFTE maintains a distinctive epigenetic profile with promoters associated with EMT and WNT pathways. Human proFTE with BRCAmut also shows epigenetic activation of EMT- and WNT-related genes. Tumors near the uterotubal junction (UTJ)-anatomically akin to proFTE-exhibit a pronounced EMT signature, increased Vimentin+E-cadherin+ and nuclear {beta}-catenin expression.

This study investigated the FLASH sparing effect under two fractionated regimens using a murine model of acute gastrointestinal toxicity. Methods and Materials: Tumor-free C57BL/6 mice received abdominal irradiation with either conventional radiotherapy (CONV) or FLASH using a 9 MeV electron beam. Three dose delivery protocols were assessed: single-fraction delivery, two equal fractions over two consecutive days, and ten equal daily fractions over two weeks. Dose escalation was performed within each protocol, while overall survival was used to monitor normal tissue sparing. The FLASH dose modifying factor (FDMF) was derived from normal tissue toxicity probability (NTCP) curves to quantify the relative protective effect of FLASH. Results: The single-fraction irradiation demonstrated a significant FLASH sparing effect, with an FDMF of 1.14. In contrast, this protective effect was diminished in the fractionated protocols, with the two-fraction regimen yielding an FDMF of 1.03, while the ten-fraction regimen showed no measurable sparing (FDMF = 1.00). Conclusions: In an acute responding model of radiation-induced abdominal toxicity, the FLASH sparing effect was substantially reduced with a two-fraction regimen and completely absent with a ten-fraction regimen. These findings suggest that the benefit of FLASH may be limited at lower doses per fraction and highlight the need for further studies in other clinically relevant models to better define the boundaries of its therapeutic applicability.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

How does the brain modify its representations of events when experiences are repeated? We hypothesized that, with repeated viewing of a narrative movie, brain regions would adapt their event representations by becoming either finer (more detailed) or coarser (more generalized). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed data from 30 human participants who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while watching three 90-second clips from \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" six times each. We used hidden Markov models and pattern similarity analysis applied to searchlights across the brain to quantify the strength of event structure at different timescales for each clip presentation. We then tested how event structure strength changed at both slow and fast timescales with repeated viewings. Most brain regions exhibited stability in the strength of event structure at both slow and fast timescales. Other regions, however, showed flexible event representations that became more or less granular across repeated clip presentations. Notably, several brain regions exhibited consistent changes in the strength of event structure at a slow timescale across different movie clips. Furthermore, in lateral occipital cortex and middle temporal gyrus, greater loss of event structure at a slow timescale predicted more detailed memory recall. These results highlight that event dynamics in the brain are not fixed, but can change flexibly with experience.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Recent advances in improving temporal resolutions for this imaging technique have opened up new research possibilities.

Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of standard motion correction methods and explore potential improvements for high temporal resolution fPET with 3s frames. We investigated two techniques aimed at improving the SNR to facilitate more accurate realignment of fPET images, in comparison to conventional motion correction: a deep-learning technique based on the application of a conditional generative adversarial network and an exponentially weighted sliding window average. Performance was evaluated by correlating rigid motion parameters between approaches and with simultaneously acquired fMRI data, and by assessing magnitudes of task-induced activation. Our results indicate that neither of the two methods substantially improve mitigation of motion artefacts. Given the increased computational effort of both techniques, we propose that the standard motion correction procedure is adequate for processing high temporal resolution fPET data.

Here, we used the rapidly progressing, highly amyloidogenic 5xFAD AD model to further delve into the effect of the SCD inhibitor (SCDi) on AD-associated fatty acid alterations and synapse loss.

Plaque pathology, gliosis, and fatty acid alterations that included an increase in the C16:1/C16:0 desaturation index, a measure of SCD enzymatic activity, were apparent in the female hippocampus at 5 months of age, with similar fatty acid changes appearing in males by 8 months. Intracerebroventricular infusion of SCDi via osmotic pump for 28 days in 5 months old female 5xFAD and NC mice modulated the SCD-related fatty acid disturbances as well as PUFA concentrations.

The discrepancies between benchmarks are further compounded by the choice of the reference genome (GRCh37, GRCh38, and T2T-CHM13), where using T2T-CHM13 reveals a different deletion/insertion profile, indicating reduced reference bias. We evaluated the performance of several state-of-the-art SV discovery methods from long-read whole-genome sequencing data and observed substantial variation in their performance and rankings, depending on the choice of ground truth, reference genome, and genomic regions used for evaluation.

M.; Paez-Watson, T.; van Loosdrecht, M. C. M.; Pabst, M.", "abstract": "Microbial communities often face environmental fluctuations that occur on timescales much shorter than their growth rate or proteome turnover. In such cases, cellular responses are likely driven by rapid changes in metabolite pools, particularly energy nucleotides including ATP, ADP, and AMP. However, robust methods to quantify these metabolites in biofilm-forming microbial communities are lacking. Here, we developed and systematically evaluated a metabolomics workflow for a granular biofilm enrichment, which performs Enhanced Biological Phosphorous Removal (EBPR). We combined fast quenching in liquid nitrogen and a boiling water extraction, followed by high resolution mass spectrometry, using porous graphitic carbon chromatography and 13C-labeled internal reference standards. Among tested procedures, a boiling water extraction was most suitable for extraction of nucleotides, as indicated by stable adenylate energy charge (AEC) and isotopic ratios. Applied to an anaerobic-aerobic cycle of a lab scale EBPR system, the method revealed dynamic changes in AEC and uridylate energy charge (UEC) during acetate uptake and polyphosphate degradation. These results demonstrate that energy pool imbalances underlie rapid metabolic switching observed in EBPR systems. Moreover, the established method provides a foundation for performing metabolomic studies of microbial biofilms in general.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

F.", "abstract": "During voluntary movement, predictions about the sensory consequences of an action typically result in reduced sensory sensitivity. The forward model theory proposes that this reduced sensitivity is due to neural suppression or cancellation of sensory action outcomes. However, recently this theory has been challenged by three alternative theories: the pre-activation account, sharpening, and the opposing processes theory. In this fMRI study, we directly tested and compared these four theories using univariate and multivariate analyses both prior to and during stimulus presentation. Participants performed a visual orientation discrimination task on two sequentially presented gratings, which were either presented automatically (passive condition) or triggered by their own button press (active condition). Auditory cues at trial onset indicated the overall grating orientation, followed by a preparatory phase in which participants anticipated the upcoming stimuli. During this phase, the predicted stimulus orientation was decodable from early visual cortex activity in both active and passive conditions at levels significantly above chance, indicating pre-activation of the predicted orientation, but with no difference between active and passive conditions. BOLD responses did not emerge earlier in active conditions, arguing against the pre-activation theory. During stimulus presentation, actively generated stimuli elicited larger BOLD responses than passively presented ones, contradicting the forward model theory, which predicts overall response suppression. Decoding accuracy did not differ between conditions, inconsistent with the sharpening hypothesis, which predicts enhanced neural precision for actively generated stimuli. Instead, our findings align most closely with the opposing processes theory, which posits pre-activation in both conditions. However, the stronger BOLD response for actively generated stimuli is not predicted by any existing theory, suggesting that additional mechanisms - such as heightened attention or motor-related enhancement - may contribute to sensory processing during self-initiated actions.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Within these dynamics there is a transitioning structure between sets of anti-correlated neural states that is frequently observed but has not been systematically investigated across scales. In this paper, we use three different naturalistic fMRI datasets to quantify anti-correlation in global and local neural states during naturalistic viewing or listening and investigate their interdependence and their relationship to changes in the stimuli. We demonstrate that continuous naturalistic brain activity shows an anti-correlational structure that spans both global and local spatial scales, with regions in the dorsal attention network showing strong alignment between local and global state transitions. On the global scale, ongoing dynamics are dominated by two antagonistic states that correspond to Default Mode Network and Task Positive Network configurations, with a third transitional state mediating between them. On the local scale, we observe anti-correlated neural states that are associated with periods of relatively high and low brain activity. Across the brain, these are driven by subsets of voxels that are systematically anti-correlated with their area's dominant activity pattern. This antagonism is related to stimulus changes, which tend to trigger a switch to the TPN state globally and to high activity states locally. On the local scale we also see a modality-specific pattern, with visual changes mostly driving transitions in visual cortical regions and auditory changes predominantly affecting auditory and language-related areas. The consistency of these findings across datasets with different stimulus types (audiovisual and purely auditory) indicates that anti-correlated neural states represent a domain-general organizational principle of brain function. We propose that anti-correlated dynamics functionally represent a convergent solution to the fundamental challenge of maintaining coherent internal representations while remaining responsive to meaningful changes in the environment.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Currently, antibiotics are the most effective treatment against the causative agent, the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. However, the use of antibiotics eventually leads to the emergence of resistant strains, which necessitates the need for alternative approaches. The use of bacteriophages to target the infection by antibiotic resistant bacteria is one such promising alternative. While clearance of Vibrio cholerae with the use of phages has been performed on several animal models, none of these models are natural hosts of V. cholerae. Therefore, we set out to investigate the interaction between V. cholerae and bacteriophage ICP1 both in vitro and in vivo in a natural host, the zebrafish model, Danio rerio. To study the interplay between host, bacteria and phages we used a combination of light and ultrastructural imaging techniques, including confocal fluorescence microscopy, serial block face SEM imaging and cryogenic electron microscopy, which allowed us to investigate both the colonization process by V. cholerae and clearance by the ICP1 bacteriophage. In addition, we determined the effects of the microbiome on this treatment by using germ-free, conventionalized and monoassociated zebrafish larvae as a host. Independent of the presence and composition of microbiomes used here, V. cholerae efficiently colonized the larval intestine.

To achieve greater flexibility in experimental design, we capitalized upon previously described dual inducer systems that combined vanillic acid (Van) or cumate (Cym) with Tet as inducers. Here we report the development of a triple inducer system combining Cym, Van and Tet repressor elements to selectively regulate the expression of three genetic elements within a single cell line called PHITER. As proof of principle to demonstrate independent control, we adapted the previously characterized Van/Tet dual inducer RNAi complementation cell line, IBCompVaT for additional Cym inducible expression of an eGFP reporter. We provide evidence that each of the inducer elements operate independently with no evidence of leaky expression. In this system, Cym induction is specific and tunable.

Understanding of the fusion protein conformational stability, rapid and accurate identification of the stabilizing interactions are critically important for inhibiting the infections. Here, we leverage molecular dynamics simulations, novel machine learning models and biological experiments to identify the crucial interactions dictating the structural stability of glycoprotein B (gB), a class III fusion protein. We focused on the interactions between the fusion loops and the membrane proximal region in gB, and a new Q181-R747 polar interaction was identified from our machine learning model as critical in stabilizing the gB pre-fusion conformation. Molecular simulations revealed that mutation of Q181 with proline (Q181P) disrupted the fusion loop secondary structure and reduced gB pre-fusion stability. Experiments were designed to evaluate the impact of the Q181P on fusion. Strikingly, the mutation completely abrogated gB membrane fusion activity. The experiments confirmed the importance of Q181-R747 interaction on fusion, which is consistent with the model predictions. The results deepen our fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms of gB during viral fusion, which may lead to novel antiviral interventions.

Recently, structural detail on the CagT4SS has been substantially improved by cryo-EM. However, important structural and functional information, in particular on protein interactions between T4SS surface proteins, and of T4SS surface proteins with other proteins, is missing. In the present study, we followed the hypothesis that H. pylori T4SS external proteins may form a surface protein assembly, together with other, non-CagT4SS proteins, which may also be essential for T4SS function. Using interaction screens of H. pylori CagT4SS surface proteins, followed by biochemical and functional characterization, we have enhanced the knowledge on protein-protein interactions of CagT4SS extracellular proteins. This also includes newly identified interactions of CagT4SS surface proteins, for instance the VirB2 homolog CagC, the VirB5 homolog CagL and the surface protein CagN of unknown function, with outer membrane proteins HopQ and HopZ. We have further identified and quantitated direct interactions of T4SS surface proteins with outer membrane proteins HopZ and HopQ, which play a role in T4SS functions, and of both HopZ and HopQ with themselves and with host cell factors CEACAM and integrin. Furthermore, we determined an influence of pH on interactions between HopQ/HopZ and CagT4SS components. Utilizing protein tag insertions in H. pylori, we detected surface-exposed association of HopQ and HopZ with T4SS components on bacteria without or with (for HopQ) human gastric epithelial cells. Functionally antagonistic roles of HopQ and HopZ were uncovered in T4SS-dependent early pro-inflammatory human epithelial cell activation. In summary, we identified a network of interactions between H. pylori outer membrane proteins and CagT4SS surface proteins and characterized them as functionally important for transport processes.

The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks endogenous DNA methyltransferases, providing a DNMT-free chassis to test the catalytic potential of candidate enzymes. Building on our finding that the Schizosaccharomyces pombe DNMT2 ortholog Pmt1 can methylate DNA in vivo, we asked whether DNMT2-family enzymes install genomic 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5mdC) across heterologous contexts. Results. We fused Pmt1 to an N-terminal SNAP tag and expressed it in S. cerevisiae, where it was well expressed, nuclear-enriched, and non-toxic. LC/MS of genomic nucleosides revealed readily detectable 5mdC in Pmt1-SNAP cells but not in empty-vector controls. After G1 arrest-release (alpha-factor), 5mdC rose at S phase and, unlike in S. pombe, did not decay over the assayed window, indicating limited methyl-cytosine clearance in the DNMT-free chassis. Extending this approach, expression of Drosophila melanogaster Dnmt2 and Plasmodium falciparum TRDMT1 in S. cerevisiae similarly yielded genomic 5mdC. In vivo, Drosophila experiments supported a DNA-directed function for Dnmt2, and in vitro S2-cell assays using two independent synchronizations showed coordinated Dnmt2 transcript induction (RT-qPCR) with an accompanying methyl-DNA signal. Conclusion. Across yeast, fly, and parasite orthologs, DNMT2-family enzymes act as bona fide DNA cytosine methyltransferases. The S. cerevisiae chassis reveals an S-phase linked 5mdC pulse that persists in the absence of native turnover pathways, offering a minimal, tractable system to dissect substrate selection, cell-state gating, and methyl-cytosine clearance for this atypical DNMT family. These heterologous results are consistent with the first in vivo report that TRDMT1 can methylate DNA in P. falciparum.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Clinical evidence suggests that exposure to traumatic stress, independent of psychopathology development, may be sufficient to induce pathophysiological sequelae, but this has not been thoroughly investigated. Using a model of repeated social defeat stress (RSDS), we explored links between the behavioral and physiological consequences of this paradigm. RSDS was sufficiently able to elevate systemic inflammation in both male and female mice, with no observed sex differences. RSDS also induced a heightened blood pressure sensitization response to low dose exogenous angiotensin II (AngII), suggesting the model was also sufficient in generating cardiovascular pathology. Interestingly, the RSDS-induced sensitization to AngII was completely abrogated in mice lacking T-lymphocytes (i.e., Rag2-/- mice). Of note, Rag2-/- mice demonstrated similar pro-social and anxiety-like behavior to wild-type mice, inferring that 1) differences in these behavioral outcomes do not explain the loss of RSDS-induced AngII sensitization in Rag2-/- mice and 2) T-lymphocytes do not appear to impact these specific RSDS-induced behaviors. Indeed, intra-animal correlations demonstrate a tight association between the inflammatory and cardiovascular consequences post-RSDS, but no associations between these parameters with behavior. Together, our data suggest that exposure to traumatic stress, independent of psychopathology, is sufficient to induce pathophysiology.

Here, in a series of high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of a protein complex at different pH values (from pH 9.0 to 3.5) we examined thousands of observable hydration sites. Cryo-EM data, in agreement with constant-pH molecular dynamics simulations, show that nearly half of protein-bound waters exchanged with the bulk solvent upon acidification, with ~100 waters lost per pH unit per molecule. The loss of waters was most significant around the side chains of glutamate and aspartate residues while specific polar residues, mostly asparagine, anchored persistent waters. A positionally conserved hydration layer was observed across all pH conditions, accounting for 40% of resolved waters. Those waters displayed denser packing than less persistent waters, forming a pH-independent solvation shell. Acid-induced water exchange also displaced bound iron, providing a mechanistic link between solvation and metal release.

By employing a Structure-Based Drug Discovery (SBDD) methodology, HyperLab streamlines the complete discovery workflow. Its core functionalities include the prediction of ligand-protein structures and binding activities (Hyper Binding), protein structure-based molecular optimization (Hyper Design), screening of extensive chemical libraries ranging from one million to seven trillion compounds (Hyper Screening and Hyper Screening X), prediction of ADMET properties (Hyper ADME/T), and an AI-driven assistant designed to boost researcher productivity and efficiency.

Furthermore, for binding affinity prediction, HyperBinding showed superior performance over both deep learning and physics-based docking models on two distinct FEP datasets, achieving Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.70 and 0.53, respectively. For experimental validation, an internal study utilized Hyper Screening to identify top-ranked compounds without without any post-analysis or visual inspection by human experts. The screening process was completed in 24 hours. Through experimental validation of top-ranked compounds, five compounds with IC50 values ranging from 70 to 600 nM were identified.

To overcome this challenge and enable advanced, high throughput quantitative analysis of PCM images, we introduce SPAGHETTI: a lightweight image translator built on a modified cycle-consistent generative adversarial network. SPAGHETTI translates PCM images into those resembling hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) pathological images which, due to the pervasive and widespread use in clinical settings, are the basis for most large-scale deep learning models for quantitative analyses. We demonstrate that by first using SPAGHETTI to translate PCM images into H&E-like images, we could achieve significantly improved performance on cell segmentation through the use of tissue and H&E-specific cell segmentation models.

One approach to reduce participant burden while maintaining statistical rigour is to optimise data analysis. Here, we present hierarchical Bayesian models tailored for cardiac and respiratory interoceptive psychophysics that efficiently estimate sensitivity, bias, and precision at both individual and group levels. Using simulations and empirical data, we validate these models and demonstrate that they allow enhanced inference relative to conventional approaches. To support adoption, we provide openly-accessible resources, including a tutorial on how to implement and fit these models in R (written with researchers without modelling expertise in mind) and an app for sample-size justification. These tools facilitate robust, efficient, and generalisable modelling of interoceptive performance, enabling rigorous studies even with limited trials or participant availability.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

F.; Johanson, T. M.; Vasanthakumar, A.; Allan, R. S.", "abstract": "Gata3 is an essential transcription factor for the development of several distinct immune cell lineages such as T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILC). As such, the levels and timing of Gata3 expression are critical for directing lineage fate decisions. The Gata3 locus has a complex and dynamic distal regulatory enhancer landscape. Recently we identified a non-coding RNA, Dreg1, located immediately upstream of the classic +280kb T/NK cell enhancer (Tce1). To test its function, we excised the Dreg1 locus in mice and observed a selective reduction of group 2 ILCs (ILC2) across multiple tissues, but mature T, NK and other ILC lineages remained unchanged. In bone marrow, common innate lymphoid cell progenitors (ILCP) increased while ILC2 progenitors (ILC2P) decreased, with a modest reduction of Gata3 in upstream progenitors consistent with an early developmental bottleneck. Chromatin profiling showed the Dreg1 locus is accessible in early lymphoid progenitors and became decorated with H3K27ac in ILCP in a Tcf1-dependent manner. Furthermore, Tcf1-deficient cells did not express Dreg1 and showed alterations in the epigenetic landscape of the Dreg1 locus. Finally, we discovered that potential homologues of Dreg1 harboured in a syntenic enhancer of GATA3 are also highly expressed in human ILC2. Taken together we conclude that Dreg1 is a Tcf1-dependent non-coding RNA critical for fine tuning the high level of Gata3 required for the optimal development of the ILC2 lineage.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

M.", "abstract": "Microbiomes are integral to the fitness of many animals, yet little is known about early-life microbiome assembly. What is known largely comes from studies in non-model organisms, where it is difficult to distinguish host genetics from the environment as drivers of microbiome assembly. Here, we used a popular vertebrate model, zebrafish (Danio rerio), to address the major drivers of environmental assembly in 124 individuals. We surveyed the egg microbiome from fertilization to hatching using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and investigated development stage and parentage as potential drivers of microbiome variation. Phylogenetic diversity of the egg microbiome decreased during development, suggesting that environmental filtering may be a major driver of community assembly. Parentage also had an influence on microbiome assembly; eggs derived from the same clutch were often more similar in microbiome composition compared to eggs derived from different clutches. The effect of parentage on microbiome similarity decreased over development, suggesting that parents may be an initial source of egg microbiome members. The egg microbiome undergoes dramatic compositional shifts during development. Understanding the drivers of this variation is important to consider, especially given the role of the microbiome in health and development, and that early exposure to microbes may shape later animal development. Our findings suggest that parents may serve as an important source of microbial symbionts to their offspring, even in an animal that does not provide parental care, such as laboratory zebrafish, and that the developing egg may play an increasingly important role in driving microbiome variation across individuals.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Despite their importance, yeast taxonomy in this context remains poorly resolved. Traditional classification methods often result in misidentifications due to the limited resolution of classical microbiological techniques and the rapidly evolving taxonomic framework driven by advances in phylogenomic. Moreover, the diversity of budding yeasts in coffee fermentations remains underexplored using high-resolution approaches such as metagenomics. To address this gap, we applied a shotgun metagenomic strategy and reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from multiple coffee fermentation samples and, using a robust phylogenomic framework based on 832 conserved single-copy genes, we confidently classified 24 yeast MAGs within the subphylum Saccharomycotina. These included well-known taxa such as Pichia kluyveri, Hanseniaspora spp., Torulaspora delbrueckii, and members of the Kurtzmaniella clade. Most MAGs were placed in strongly supported monophyletic groups (ultrafast bootstrap = 100), with short intra-clade branch lengths indicative of intraspecific variation. Pichia kluyveri emerged as the most abundant and widespread species, detected in all analyzed metagenomes, followed by Hanseniaspora spp. Our results underscore the power of high-resolution phylogenomic for classifying yeast MAGs and highlight the ecological importance of Pichia, Hanseniaspora, Torulaspora, and Kurtzmaniella in spontaneous coffee fermentations.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Here, we identify the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 as a key regulator of EBNA1 through site-specific SUMOylation. Our Chromatin-Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis revealed that PIAS1 is enriched at the viral origin of plasmid replication (oriP), where it physically associates with EBNA1 and catalyzes its SUMOylation. Using mutational analysis, we identified three lysine residues on EBNA1 (K17, K75, and K241) as major SUMOylation sites. Disruption of these sites compromises EBNA1s ability to restrict EBV lytic replication. In addition, both PIAS1 depletion and the disruption of EBNA1 SUMOylation lead to reduced retention of EBNA1-OriP-based EBV mini-replicon, indicating the importance of EBNA1 SUMOylation in viral episome maintenance. Together, these results uncover a conserved post-translational mechanism by which PIAS1-mediated SUMOylation modulates EBNA1 function and EBV episome maintenance and suggests a broader role for SUMOylation in viral latency, lytic replication and persistence.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Pnky adopts a compact structure in vitro with distinct modules and evidence of tertiary interactions. In cellulo, Pnky structure is remarkably similar to the in vitro conformation. We used locked nucleic acid oligonucleotides to interrogate the entire Pnky transcript for function in NSCs and identified regions that when targeted increased neurogenesis - phenocopying Pnky knockdown - without decreasing transcript abundance.

Yet nocturnal animals employ a celestial compass to orient at night (i.e. the moon and stars, but navigation via a time-compensated lunar compass has yet to be demonstrated. Nocturnal bull ants (Myrmecia midas) navigate home overnight under the dimmest of visual conditions, relying in part on a nocturnal path-integration system informed by lunar cues. Here, we show the first evidence of a time-compensated lunar compass in a homing animal, with path-integrating ants adjusting path headings by predicting the lunar azimuthal position throughout the night. Ants predict the moons future position based upon a generalised internal estimate of the lunar ephemeris. Rather than detailed knowledge of the moons nightly schedule, these ants form a lunar path representation via a speed-step function, reflecting the moons accelerating then decelerating arc. However, these ants also predictably under- or overestimate the shape of this arc based on individual experience, suggesting a level of temporal uncertainty regarding when the moon rapidly shifts from the eastern to western sky. Additionally, updating this lunar compass relies on the presence of a directionally informative skyline, which allows occasional cross-referencing of lunar movement with external fixed compass cues near the horizon.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Using simulated food webs, we show that reintroductions can frequently have unintended negative consequences: triggering extinction cascades, reducing biomass, and destabilising communities.

Food resources were assessed for walleye larvae, young-of-the-year, juveniles, and adults. Growth and relative abundance were also quantified for young-of-the-year, juvenile, and adult walleye. Young-of-the-year were more abundant and grew faster in degraded lakes compared to non-degraded controls, benefiting from high populations of spring zooplankton, which are a critical larval resource. The simplified food webs in degraded lakes lacked pollution-sensitive macroinvertebrates, which resulted in walleye diets being even more dominated by fish. Although juveniles and adults were equally or more abundant in degraded lakes compared to control lakes, premature adult mortality compromised population stability. We recommend focusing on improving adult fish habitat, manage for prey species, and review fishing regulations to enhance the survival of mature walleye and ensure sustainable populations.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

To understand what guides tRNA evolution, we examined the tRNA gene complement from 17 closely related mouse strain genomes.

We find that OSK expression in RPE restores retinal structure and visual function in aged mice and promotes oxidative resilience through a non-canonical, Tet2-independent pathway. Integrative functional genomics identifies GSTA4, a detoxifying enzyme that clears the lipid peroxidation byproduct 4-HNE, as a necessary and sufficient OSK effector. Dynamic GSTA4 regulation by OSK recapitulates a stem cell derived stress resilience program. GSTA4 overexpression alone enhances mitochondrial resilience, rejuvenates the aged RPE transcriptome, and reverses visual decline.

Here, we establish a predictive multi-tissue map of human Pol III activity across 19 tissues and 23 primary cancer subtypes by comprehensively profiling the chromatin accessibility of canonical Pol III-transcribed gene classes. Our framework relies on the unique relationship between gene accessibility and Pol III transcription, inferring activity through uniform binary classification of ATAC-seq enrichment at Pol III-transcribed genes. By characterizing multi-context gene uniformity, we provide a definition of the core Pol III transcriptome, broadly active across specialized tissues, and catalog genes with varied levels of context specificity. Our genomic Pol III atlas uncovers variable levels of activity across tissues, including sharp contraction of the Pol III transcriptome in heart and brain tissues and frequent expansion across diverse cancers. We show that both tissue- and tumor-specific genes are significantly enriched within lamina-associated domains (LADs), and that aberrant expression of nuclear lamin proteins is sufficient to induce Pol III-emergent patterns at tumor-specific genes.

In this work we have combined structural homology searches with genome-wide predicted structures to identify ancestral COMMD-like proteins that exist as single genes in Bacteria and Archaea. Although there is limited sequence similarity to the eukaryotic proteins the bacterial and archaeal COMMD-like proteins are predicted to form homomeric ring-shaped assemblies like their eukaryotic counterparts. Our biophysical studies, crystal and cryo-EM structures confirm COMMD-like proteins readily form homooligomeric rings composed of eight or ten subunits assembled from core dimeric building blocks and inter-dimer interactions that are analogous to the heterodecameric core structure of the eukaryotic Commander complex.

This approach reveals the most refined sequence-dependent profile of nucleosomes reported to date. Comparison of H2A-A122C with the H3-Q85C and H4-S47C methods clearly shows a sequence preference for the chemical cleavage site, and mapping results suggest that the nucleosome locations are dynamic in vivo. More importantly, we find that the depletion of CC and GG dinucleotides at nucleotide positions -11 to -9 and +9 to +11 bp, respectively, from the nucleosome dyad position (0) is inextricably associated with the enrichment of AA/AT/TA/TT dinucleotides in both yeast and mouse genomes.

In this iterative process, progressively shorter tailed RNAs are formed. In C. elegans, injection of poly(UG)-tailed single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) leads to RNAi-mediated gene silencing, thereby bypassing the need for the processing of double-stranded RNA into siRNAs. We wondered if poly(UG)-tailed ssRNAs could also be used for experimental gene knockdown in nematodes where long dsRNA-mediated RNAi does not work reliably, such as the satellite model organism Pristionchus pacificus or parasitic nematodes of the genus Strongyloides. Here we show that injection of poly(UG)-tailed RNA leads to gene knock down in P. pacificus and that the injected RNA, as well as the corresponding endogenous RNA, serve as substrate for the formation of new poly(UG)-tailed RNAs. Different from C. elegans, in P. pacificus, the knockdown effect depends on the redundant activity of the three rde-1 paralogs present in this species. We detected endogenously occurring poly(UG)-tailed RNAs derived from thousands of genes, more than half of which belong to germline-specific co-expression clusters. Mutations in Ppa-rde-3, lead to sterility. In contrast, in Strongyloides spp., we found poly(UG)-tailed RNAs to be much less abundant, if not absent. Our results show that poly(UG)-tailed RNAs are not restricted to C. elegans and suggest that they play an important function in the germ line in P. pacificus.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

P.; Nejat, N.; Rasgon, J. L.", "abstract": "Background: Microbiota play a crucial role in determining the ability for arthropod disease vectors to transmit pathogens. Microbial community structure can be heavily influenced by microbe-microbe interactions, host genetics and environmental factors. Here, we characterize the host population genetic structure, and bacterial and fungal communities in natural populations of the West Nile virus mosquito vector Culex tarsalis. Mosquitoes were collected and analyzed across the species range of the mosquito in the United States, where we used PoolRADSeq to quantify population genetic structure. Microbial community composition was characterized using bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing (V3-V4 region) and fungal ITS sequencing (ITS1 region). Results: PoolRADSeq identified four broad genetic clusters of mosquito populations, which corresponded to previous clusters identified by microsatellite analysis and RADSeq on individual mosquitoes. Microbiome diversity grouped mosquito populations into three broad clusters, with each cluster distinctively represented by diagnostic abundant bacteria (Ralstonia, Pseudomonas, or Zymobacter/Providencia, respectively). Clustering for fungal taxa was less pronounced. Geographic distance between populations was positively correlated with microbiome community dissimilarity, and multiple environmental factors were significantly correlated with microbial species richness and diversity. Conclusions: These results suggest that bacterial and fungal communities are geographically structured in Cx. tarsalis, interact with important environmental factors, and are partially correlated with host genetic structure. As microbiota can affect the ability for mosquitoes to transmit pathogens, understanding the factors underpinning microbiome variation across space and time has important implications for the spread of vector-borne pathogens such as WNV.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

R.; Conover, J. L.; Barker, M. S.; Gutenkunst, R. N.", "abstract": "Polyploidy and whole genome duplication (WGD) are widespread biological phenomena with substantial cellular, meiotic, and genetic effects. Despite their prevalence and significance across the tree of life, population genetics theory for polyploids is not well developed. The lack of theoretical models limits our understanding of polyploid evolution and restricts our ability to harness polyploidy for crop improvement amidst increasing environmental stress. To address this gap, we developed and analyzed deterministic models of mutation-selection balance for tetraploids under polysomic (autotetraploid) and disomic (allotetraploid) inheritance patterns and arbitrary dominance relationships. We also introduced a new mathematical framework based on ordinary differential equations and nonlinear dynamics for analyzing the models. We find that autotetraploids approach Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium 33% faster than allotetraploids, but the different tetraploid inheritance models show little differences in mutation load and allele frequency at mutation-selection balance. Our model also reveals two bistable points of mutation-selection balance for dominant alleles with biased mutation rates over a wide range of selection coefficients in the tetraploid models compared to bistability in only a narrow range for diploids. Finally, using discrete time simulations, we explore the temporal dynamics of allele frequency and fitness change and compare these dynamics to the predictions of Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection. While Fisher's predictions generally hold, we show that the bistable dynamics for dominant mutations fundamentally alter the associated temporal dynamics. Overall, this work develops foundational theoretical models that will facilitate the development of population genetic models and methodologies to study evolution in empirical tetraploid populations.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

However, the evolution of mutualism remains unclear in symbionts using both vertical and horizontal transmission. In this study, we show that Ascogregarina taiwanensis, previously known as a weak horizontally transmitted parasite of the Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), exhibits mutualistic traits that enhance mosquito reproduction. The symbiont improves embryogenesis and extends the egg-laying period while most females are pseudo-vertically transmitting symbiont oocysts to their progeny at oviposition sites. Dual transcriptomic analyses reveal that early oogenesis in infected females involves increased nitrogen metabolism in both partners, enhanced detoxification of blood waste, and activation of egg development pathways. These changes lead to improved assimilation of blood proteins essential for egg production. Our findings provide rare empirical evidence of a symbiont displaying both parasitic and mutualistic traits, offering new insights into the evolutionary dynamics of mixed-mode transmission symbioses.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Yet when mutations in humans are decomposed into a set of \"signatures\" one single base substitution signature, SBS5, is present across cell types and tissues, and predominates in post-mitotic neurons as well as male and female germlines (Alexandrov et al. 2020, Lodato et al. 2018, Spisak et al. 2024). The etiology of SBS5 is unknown. By modeling the processes by which mutations arise, we infer that SBS5 is the footprint of errors in DNA synthesis triggered by distinct types of DNA damage. Supporting this hypothesis, we find that SBS5 rates increase with signatures of endogenous and exogenous DNA damage in cancerous and non-cancerous cells and co-vary with repair rates along the genome as expected from model predictions. These analyses indicate that SBS5 captures the output of a \"funnel\", through which multiple sources of damage result in a similar mutation spectrum. As we further show, SBS5 mutations arise not only from translesion synthesis but also from DNA repair, suggesting that the signature reflects the occasional, shared use of a polymerase.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

In recent decades, methods such as viruses, bacteria, and mechanical techniques have been utilized for gene transfer. However, Owing to the significant side effects of traditional methods for cancer treatment, especially chemotherapy, nanoparticles have emerged as a preferred alternative, enhancing targeted gene delivery and reducing complications. This study utilized copolymers such as spermine-chitosan-polycaprolactone (PCL) (PCS) and iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4) to protect DNA and facilitate oligonucleotide transfer. Additionally, spermine-PCL-chitosan-polyethylene glycol (PEG)-folic acid (SPCPF) micelles were synthesized to control DNA release and target tumors. SCPPF/Fe3O4/DNA micelles were then prepared, and their properties, including protection against plasma degradation, ability to release DNA, physicochemical properties, transfection efficiency, and cytotoxicity, were evaluated in vitro. The study also investigated the impact of two buffer pH values (6 and 7.4) on DNA release from micelles, revealing that a lower pH significantly increased the release rate. Electrophoretic analysis confirmed that the micelle coating effectively protected DNA from degradation in plasma. VSM (vibrating sample magnetometer) analysis was used to assess the magnetic properties of the SCPPF/Fe3O4/DNA micelles, revealing that encapsulation with PCS and PCPF yielded nanoparticles with desirable magnetic characteristics. However, the encapsulation value reduced the saturation magnetic properties of the samples from 13.4 to 39.3 emu/g. Furthermore, the micelles significantly improved the DNA transfer efficiency compared with that of the polyethylenimine (PEI)/DNA complex in serum, achieving 14.42% efficiency with the SCPPF/Fe3O4/DNA micelles compared with 10.6% for the PEI/DNA complex. In terms of cytotoxicity, the SCPPF/Fe3O4 micelles exhibited low toxicity to the AGS cell line.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}

Despite the contribution of planning to many everyday activities, the neurocognitive processes that map a selected plan into a concrete course of action are unclear. We asked whether planning and execution are linked by abstract task relationships that are divorced from the specifics of action implementation. Human participants underwent functional MRI while performing a task that required encoding and maintaining abstract representations in order to plan and later apply those representations to execute action sequences. Our analyses revealed that dorsomedial prefrontal cortex encoded representations during the planning period that shifted progressively from information based on perceptual input to information associated with the abstract task context. These abstract representations were then used to translate between the action plan and its execution irrespective of the perceptual and motor details, indicating that DMPFC builds and sustains an abstract representational bridge that links planning to action.", "date": "2025-09-01", "journal": ""}
